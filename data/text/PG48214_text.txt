     IV. OPEN SPACE AS IN SCENE II.



FIRST SCENE


_At the bottom of the Rhine_


_A greenish twilight, lighter above than below. The upper part is filled
with undulating water, which streams respectively from right to left.
Towards the bottom the waves resolve themselves into a mist which
grows finer as it descends, so that a space, as high as a mans body
from the ground, appears to be quite free from the water, which
floats like a train of clouds over the gloomy stretch below. Steep
rocky peaks jut up everywhere from the depths, and enclose the entire
stage. The ground is a wild confusion of jagged rocks, no part of
it being quite level, and on every side deeper fisures are indicated
by a still denser gloom. Woglinde circles with graceful swimming
movements round the central rock._



WOGLINDE

      Weia! Waga!
      Roll, O ye billows,
      Rock ye our cradle!
      Wagala weia!
  Wallala, weiala, weia!

WELLGUNDE [_From above._

      Woglinde, watchest alone?

WOGLINDE

      If Wellgunde came we were two.

WELLGUNDE [_Dives down to the rock_.

      How keepest thou watch?

WOGLINDE [_Swimming off, eludes her_.

      Wary of thee.

        [_They playfully tease and chase one another_.

FLOSSHILDE [_From above_.

      Heiaha weia!
      Ho! ye wild sisters!

WELLGUNDE

      Flosshilde, swim!
      Woglinde flies:
  Help me to hinder her flying.

FLOSSHILDE [_Dives down between the two at play._

      The sleeping gold
      Badly ye guard;
      Watch with more zeal
      The slumberer's bed,
  Or dear you'll pay for your sport!

        [_They swim asunder with merry cries. Flosshilde
        tries to catch first the one, then the other.
        They elude her, and then combine to chase her,
        darting like fish from rock to rock with jests and
        laughter. Meanwhile Alberich climbs out of a dark
        ravine on to a rock. He pauses, still surrounded
        by darkness, and watches the frolic of the
        Rhine-Maidens with increasing pleasure._

ALBERICH

      Hey, hey! ye nixies!
      Ye are a lovely,
      Lovable folk!
      From Nibelheim's night
      Fain would I come,
  Would ye be kind to me.

        [_The maidens, as soon as they hear Alberich's
        voice, stop playing._

WOGLINDE

      Hei! Who is there?

WELLGUNDE

      A voice! It grows dark!

FLOSSHILDE

      Who listens below?

        [_They dive down and see the Nibelung._

WOGLINDE and WELLGUNDE

      Fie! the loathsome one!

[Illustration: Plate 02, The frolic of the Rhine-Maidens.]

FLOSSHILDE [_Swimming up quickly._

      Look to the gold!
      Father warned us
      Of such a foe.

        [Both the others follow her, and all three gather
        quickly round the central rock.

ALBERICH

      You above there!

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS

      What wouldst thou below there?

ALBERICH

      Do I spoil sport
      By standing and gazing here?
      Dived ye but deeper,
      Fain the Niblung
  Would join in your frolic and play.

WELLGUNDE

      He wishes to join us?

WOGLINDE

      Is he in jest?

ALBERICH

      Ye gleam above me
      So glad and fair!
      If one would only
  Glide down, how close in my arms
  Fondly clasped she would be!

FLOSSHILDE

      I laugh at my fears:
      The foe is in love.

WELLGUNDE

      The amorous imp!

WOGLINDE

      Let us approach him.

        [She sinks down to the top of the rock, whose base
        Alberich has reached.

ALBERICH

      Lo! one of them comes!

WOGLINDE

      Climb up to me here!

ALBERICH

        [_Climbs with gnome-like agility, though with
        repeated checks, to the summit of the rock.
        Irritably._

      Horrid rock,
      So slippery, slimy!
      I slide and slip!
      My hands and feet vainly
      Attempt to hold on
      To the slithery surface!
      Vapour damp
      Fills up my nostrils--
      Accursed sneezing!

        [_He has got near Woglinde,_

WOGLINDE [_Laughing._

      Sneezing tells
      That my suitor comes!

ALBERICH

      Be thou my love!
      Adorable child!

        [_He tries to embrace her._

WOGLINDE [_Escaping from him._

      Here thou must woo,
      If woo me thou wilt!

        [_She swims up to another rock._

ALBERICH [_Scratching his head._

      Alas! not yet caught?
      Come but closer!
      Hard I found
  What so lightly thou didst.

WOGLINDE [_Swims to a third rock lower down._

      Deeper descend:
      Thou'lt certainly seize me!

ALBERICH [_Clambers down quickly._

      Down there it is better!

WOGLINDE [_Darts upwards to a higher rock at the side._

      But better still higher!

WELLGUNDE AND FLOSSHILDE [_Laughing_

      Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

ALBERICH

      How capture this coy,
      Elusive fish?
      Wait for me, false one!

        [_He tries to climb after her in haste._

WELLGUNDE

        [_Has sunk down to a lower rock on the other side._

      Heia! my friend there!
      Dost thou not hear?

ALBERICH [_Turning round._

      What? Didst thou call?

WELLGUNDE

      Be counselled by me:
      Forsake Woglinde,
      Climb up to me now!

ALBERICH

        [_Climbs hastily over the river-bottom towards
        Wellgunde._

      Thou art more comely
      Far than that coy one;
      Her sheen is duller,
      Her skin too smooth.
      But thou must deeper
      Dive to delight me!

WELLGUNDE

        [_Sinking down till she is a little nearer him._


      Well, now am I near?

ALBERICH

      Not near enough.
      Thine arms around me
      Tenderly throw,
      That I may fondle
      Thy neck with my fingers,
      And closely may cling
  To thy bosom with love and with longing.

WELLGUNDE

      Art thou in love?
      For love art thou pining?
      Approach and show me
      Thy face and thy form.
      Fie! thou horrible
      Hunchback, for shame!
      Swarthy, horny-skinned
      Rogue of a dwarf!
      Find thou a sweetheart
      Fonder than I?

ALBERICH

        [_Tries to detain her by force_

      I may not be fair,
      But fast I can hold!

WELLGUNDE


        [_Swimming up quickly to the middle rock._

      Hold firm, or I will escape!

WOGLINDE AND FLOSSHILDE [_Laughing._

      Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

ALBERICH [_Angrily calling after Wellgunde._

      Fickle maid!
  Bony, cold-blooded fish!
      Fair if I seem not,
      Pretty and playful
      Smooth and sleek--
  Hei! if I am so loathsome
  Give thy love to the eels!

FLOSSHILDE

      What ails thee, dwarf?
      Daunted so soon?
      Though two have been wooed,
      Still a third waits thee,
      Solace sweet
  Fain at a word to grant!

ALBERICH

      Soothing song
      Sounds in my ear!
      'Twas well I found
      Three and not one!
  The chance is I charm one of many,
  Whilst, single, no one would choose me!
      Hither come gliding,
      And I will believe!

FLOSSHILDE [_Dives down to Alberich._

      How senseless are ye,
      Silly sisters,
  Not to see he is fair!

ALBERICH [_Hastening towards her._

      I well may deem them
      Dull and ill-favoured,
  Seeing how lovely thou art!

FLOSSHILDE

      Sing on! Thy song,
      So soft and sweet,
  Entrancing sounds in my ear!

ALBERICH [_Caressing her with confidence._

      My heart burns
      And flutters and fails,
  Flattered by praises so sweet!

FLOSSHILDE [_Gently resisting him._

      Thy grace and beauty
      Make glad my eye;
      And thy smile refreshes
      My soul like balm

        [_She draws him tenderly towards her._

      Dearest of men!

ALBERICH

      Sweetest of maids!

FLOSSHILDE

      Wert thou but mine!

ALBERICH

      Wert mine for ever!

FLOSSHILDE [_Ardently._

      To be pierced by thy glance,
      To be pricked by thy beard,
  To see and to feel them for aye!
      Might thy hair hard as bristles
      Flow ever more
  Enraptured Flosshilde wreathing!
      And thy form like a frog's,
      And the croak of thy voice--
      O could I, dumb with amaze,
      Marvel forever on these!

WOGLINDE AND WELLGUNDE

        [_Dive down close to them and laugh._

      Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

ALBERICH [_Starting in alarm._

      Wretches, dare ye thus scoff?

FLOSSHILDE [_Suddenly darting away from him._

      A suitable end to the song.
         [_She swims up quickly with her sisters._

WOGLINDE AND WELLGUNDE [_Laughing._

      Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

ALBERICH [_In a wailing voice._

      Woe's me! Ah, woe's me!
      Alas! Alas!
      The third one, so dear,
      Does she too betray?
      O sly and shameful
  Worthless and dissolute wantons!
      Live ye on lies
  Alone, O ye false nixie brood?

THE THREE RHINE MAIDENS

      Wallala! Wallala!
  Lalalelai leialalei!
  Heia! Heia! ha! ha!
      Shame on thee goblin,
      Scolding down yonder!
  Cease, and do as we bid thee!
      Faint-hearted wooer,
      Why couldst not hold
  The maid, when won, more fast?
      True are we,
      And troth we keep
  With lovers when once caught.
      Grasp then and hold;
      Away with all fear!
  In the waves we scarce can escape.
      Wallala!
  Lalaleia! Leialalei!
  Heia! Heia! Ha hei!

        [_They swim apart hither and thither, now lower,
        now higher, to provoke Alberich to give chase._

[Illustration: Plate 03, The Rhine-Maidens teasing Alberich.]

ALBERICH

       Fiercely within me
       Passionate fires
       Consume and flame!
       Love and fury,
       Wild, resistless,
       Lash me to frenzy!
  So laugh and lie your fill--
       One of you I desire,
       And one must yield to my yearning!

        [_He starts chasing them with desperate energy.
        He climbs with terrible agility, and, springing
        from rock to rock, tries to catch one maiden
        after another. They keep eluding him with mocking
        laughter. He stumbles and falls into the abyss, and
        clambers up quickly again and resumes the chase.
        They sink down a little towards him; he almost
        reaches them, but falls, back again, and once
        more tries to catch them. At last he pauses out
        of breath, and, foaming with rage, stretches his
        clenched fist up towards the maidens._

ALBERICH

      If but this fist had one!

        [_He remains speechless with rage, gazing upwards,
        when he is suddenly attracted and arrested by the
        following spectacle. Through the water a light
        of continually increasing brilliance breaks from
        above, and, at a point near the top of the middle
        rock, kindles to a radiant and dazzling golden
        gleam. A magical light streams from this through
        the waves._

WOGLINDE

      Look, sisters!
      The wakener laughs to the deep.

WELLGUNDE

      Through the billows green
      The blissful slumberer greets.

FLOSSHILDE

      He kisses the eyelid,
      Making it open;
      Bathed in splendour,
      Behold it smiles,
      Sending, like a star,
  Gleaming light through the waves.

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS

        [_Swimming gracefully round the cliff together._

      Heia jaheia!
      Heia jaheia!
  Wallala la la la leia jahei!
      Rhinegold!
      Rhinegold!
      Radiant delight,
  How glorious and glad thy smile,
      Over the water
  Shooting effulgence afar!
      Heia jahei!
      Heia jaheia!
      Waken, friend!
      Wake in joy!
      That we may please thee,
      Merry we'll play,
      Waters afire,
      Billows aflame,
      As, blissfully bathing,
      Dancing and singing,
  We dive and encircle thy bed!
      Rhinegold!
      Rhinegold!
      Heia jaheia!
      Heia jaheia!
  Wallala la la la heia jahei!

        [_With increasing mirthful abandonment the maidens
        swim round the rock. The water is filled with a
        glimmering golden light._

ALBERICH

        [_Whose eyes, strongly attracted by the radiance,
        stare fixedly at the gold._

      What is it, sleek ones,
      That yonder gleams and shines?

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS

      Where dost thou hail from, O churl,
      Of the Rhinegold not to have heard?

WELLGUNDE

      Knows not the elf
      Of the famed eye golden
  That wakes and sleeps in turn?

WOGLINDE

      Of the star resplendent
      Down in the depths
  Whose light illumines the waves?

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS [_Together_

      See how gaily
      We glide in the glory!
      Wouldst thou also
      Be bathed in brightness,
  Come, float and frolic with us!
  Wallala la la leia lalei!
  Wallala la la leia jahei!

ALBERICH

      Has the gold no value
      Apart from your games?
      It were not worth getting!

WOGLINDE

      He would not scoff,
      Scorning the gold,
  Did he but know all its wonders!

WELLGUNDE

  That man surely
  The earth would inherit
      Who from the Rhinegold
      Fashioned the ring
  Which measureless power imparts.

FLOSSHILDE

      Our father told us,
      And strictly bade us
      Guard with prudence
      The precious hoard
  That no thief from the water might steal it.
  Be still, then, chattering fools.

WELLGUNDE

      O prudent sister,
      Why chide and reproach?
      Hast thou not heard
      That one alone
  Can hope to fashion the gold?

WOGLINDE

      Only the man
      Who love defies,
      Only the man
      From love who flies
  Can learn and master the magic
  That makes a ring of the gold.

WELLGUNDE

      Secure then are we
      And free from care:
  For love is part of living;
  No one would live without loving.

WOGLINDE

      And least of all he,
      The languishing elf,
      With pangs of love
      Pining away.

FLOSSHILDE

      I fear him not
      Who should surely know,
      By his savage lust
      Almost inflamed.

[Illustration: Plate 04
      "Mock away! Mock away!
  The Niblung makes for your toy!"]

WELLGUNDE

      A brimstone brand
      In the surging waves,
      In lovesick frenzy
      Hissing loud.

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS [_Together._

    Wallala! Wallaleia la la!
      Join in our laughter,
      Lovable elf!
      In the golden glory
      How gallant thy sheen!
  O come, lovely one, laugh as we laugh!
      Heia jaheia!
      Heia jaheia!
  Wallala la la la leia jahei!

        [_They swim, laughing, backwards and forwards in
        the light._

ALBERICH

        [_His eyes fixed on the gold, has listened
        attentively to the sisters rapid chatter._

      Could I truly
  The whole earth inherit through thee?
      If love be beyond me
  My cunning could compass delight?

        [_In a terribly loud voice._

      Mock away! Mock!
  The Niblung makes for your toy!

        [_Raging he springs on to the middle rock,
        and clambers to the top. The maidens scatter,
        screaming, and swim upwards on different sides._

THE THREE RHINE MAIDENS

  Heia! Heia!heia jahei!
      Save yourselves!
      The elf is distraught!
      Swirling waters splash
      At every leap:
  The creature's crazy with love!
  Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

ALBERICH

        [_Reaching the topwith a last spring._

      Still undismayed?
      Go, wanton in darkness.
      Water-born brood!

        [_He stretches his hand out towards the gold._

  My hand quenches your light;
  I tear the gold from the rock;
  Forged be the ring for revenge!
      Bear witness, ye floods--
  I forswear love and curse it!

        [_He tears the gold from the rock with terrific
        force, and immediately plunges with it into the
        depths, where he quickly disappears. Sudden
        darkness envelops the scene. The maidens dive down
        after the robber._

THE THREE RHINE MAIDENS

      Seize the despoiler!
      Rescue the gold!
      Help us! Help us!
      Woe! Woe!

        [_The water sinks with them. From the lowest depth
        Alberich's shrill, mocking laughter rings up. The
        rocks are hidden by impenetrable darkness. The
        whole stage from top to bottom is filled with black
        waves, which for some time appear to sink even
        lower._


[Illustration: plate 05
    "Seize the despoiler!
    Rescue the gold!
    Help us! Help us!
    Woe! Woe!"]




SECOND SCENE


_The waves have gradually changed into clouds which, becoming lighter
and lighter by degrees, finally disperse in a fine mist. As the mist
vanishes upwards in light little clouds an open space on a mountain
height becomes visible in the dim light which precedes dawn. At one
side Wotan with Fricka beside him both asleep, lie on a flowery bank.
The dawning day illumines with increasing brightness a castle with
glittering pinnacles which stands on the summit of a cliff in the
background. Between this and the foreground a deep valley is visible
through which the Rhine flows._



FRICKA

        [_Awakes; her gaze falls on the castle, which has
        become plainly visible; alarmed._

WOTAN [_Continuing to dream._

  The happy hall of delight
  Is guarded by gate and door:
      Manhood's honour,
      Power for aye,
  Rise to my lasting renown!

FRICKA [_Shakes him._

      Up from deceitful
      Bliss of a dream!
  My husband, wake and consider!

WOTAN

        [_Awakes and raises himself slightly. His glance is
        immediately arrested by the view of the castle._

  The walls everlasting are built!
      On yonder summit
      The Gods' abode
      Proudly rears
      Its radiant strength!
  As I nursed it in dream
  And desired it to be,
      Strong it stands,
      Fair to behold,
  Brave and beautiful pile!

FRICKA

      While thou rejoicest,
      Joyless am I.
      Thou hast thy hall;
      My heart fears for Freia.
  Heedless one, hast thou forgotten
  The price that was to be paid?
      The work is finished,
      And forfeit the pledge:
  Hast thou then no care for the cost?

WOTAN

  My bargain well I remember
  With them who built the abode.
      'Twas a pact tamed them,
      The obstinate race,
      So that this hallowed
      Hall they have built me.
  It stands--the strong ones' doing:--
  Fret not thou, counting the cost.

FRICKA

  O laughing, insolent lightness!
  Mirth how cruel and callous!
  Had I but known of thy pact,
  The trick had never been played;
      But far from your counsels
      Ye men kept the women,
  That, deaf to us and in peace,
  Alone ye might deal with the giants.
      So without shame
      Ye promised them Freia,
  Freia, my beautiful sister,
  Proud of playing the thief.
      What remains holy
      Or precious to men
  Once grown greedy of might?

WOTAN [_Calmly._

      From such greed
      Was Fricka then free
  Herself when the castle she craved?

FRICKA

  I was forced to ponder some means
  To keep my husband faithful,
  True to me when his fancy
  Tempted him far from his home.
      Halls high and stately,
      Decked to delight thee,
      Were to constrain thee
      To peaceful repose.
  But thou hadst the work designed
  Intent on war alone;
      It was to add
      More to thy might still,
      To stir up to tumult still fiercer
  That built were the towering walls

WOTAN

      Wouldst thou, O Wife!
      In the castle confine me,
  To me, the god, must be granted,
      Faithful at home,
      The right to wage war
  And conquer the world from without.
      Ranging and changing
      All men love:
  That sport at least thou must leave me.

FRICKA

      Cold, hard-hearted,
      Merciless man!
      For the idle baubles,
      Empire and sway,
  Thou stakest in insolent scorn
  Love and a woman's worth!

WOTAN

  When I went wooing, to win thee
      I staked ungrudging,
  Gladly one of my eyes:
  What folly now then to scold!
      Women I honour
      Beyond thy desire!
      I will not abandon
      Frei, the fair:
  Such never was my intent.

FRICKA

        [_ Anxiously looking towards a point not on the
        stage._

      Then succour her now:
      Defenceless, in fear,
  Hither she hastens for help!

FREIA

        [_Enters as if flying from someone._

       Help me, sister!
       Shield me, o brother!
       From yonder mountain
       Menaces Fasolt:
   He comes to bear me off captive.

WOTAN

      Let him come!
      Sawest thou Loge?

FRICKA

      To this tricky deceiver
      O why wilt thou trust?
  He always snares thee anew,
  Though from his snares thou hast suffered.

WOTAN

  I ask for no aid
  Where simple truth suffices;
      But to turn the spite
      Of foes to profit,
  Craft and cunning alone
  Can teach, as by Loge employed.
  He whose advice I obeyed
  Has promised ransom for Freia:
  On him my faith I have fixed.

FRICKA

  And art left in the lurch.
      The giants come.
      Lo! hither they stride:
  Where lingers now thine ally?

FREIA

      Where tarry ye, my brothers,
      When help ye should bring me,
  Weak and bartered away by my kin?
      O help me, Donner!
      Hither! Hither!
  Rescue Freia, my Froh!

FRICKA

  Now the knaves who plotted and tricked thee
  Abandon thee in thy need.

        [_Fasolt and Fafner, both of gigantic stature,
        enter, armed with stout clubs._

FASOLT

      Soft sleep
      Sealed thine eyes
      While we, both sleepless,
  Built the castle walls:
      Working hard
      Wearied not,
      Heaping, heaving
      Heavy stones.
      Tower steep,
      Door and gate
      Keep and guard
  Thy goodly castle halls.

        [_Pointing to the castle._

      There stands
      What we builded,
      Shining fair
      Beneath the sun.
      Enter in
  And pay the price!

WOTAN

  Name, Workers, your wage.
  What payment will appease you?

FASOLT

  We made the terms
  That seemed to us meet.
  Hast thou forgot so soon?
      Freia, the fair one,
      Holda, the free one--
      The bargain is
  We bear her away.

WOTAN (Quickly.)

      Ye must be mad
      To moot such a thing!
  Ask some other wage;
  Freia I will not grant.

FASOLT

        _Stands for a space speechless with angry surprise._

      What is this? Ha!
      Wouldest deceive?--
      Go back on thy bond?
      What thy spear wards
      Are they but sport,
  All the runes of solemn bargain?

FAFNER

      O trusty brother!
  Fool, dost now see the trick?

FASOLT

      Son of light,
      Light, unstable,
  Hearken! Have a care!
  In treaties keep thou troth!
      What thou art
      Thou art only by treaties,
      For, built on bonds,
  There are bounds to thy might.
      Though cunning thou,
      More clever than we:
      Though we once freemen,
      Are pledged to peace,
  Cursed be all thy wisdom;--
      Peaceful promises perish!--
      Wilt thou not open,
  Honest and frank
  Stand fast by a bargain once fixed.
      A stupid giant
      Tells thee this:
  O wise one, take it from him!

[Illustration: plate 06, Freia, the fair one]

WOTAN

  How sly to judge us serious
  When plainly we were but jesting!
      The beautiful Goddess
      Light and bright--
  For churls what charm could she have?

FASOLT

      Jeerest thou?
      Ha! how unjust!
  Ye who by beauty rule,
  Proud and radiant race!
      How foolish, striving
      For towers of stone,
  Woman's love to pledge--
  Price of walls and of halls!
  We dolts, despising ease,
  Sweating with toil-hardened hands,
      Have worked, that a woman
      With gentle delight
  In our midst might sojourn
  And ye call the pact a jest?

FAFNER

  Cease thy childish chatter;
  No gain look we to get.
      Freia's charms
      Mean little;
  But it means much,
  If from the Gods we remove her.
      Golden apples
  Ripen within her garden;
      She alone
  Grows the apples and tends them.
      The goodly fruit
      Gives to her kinsfolk,
      Who eat thereof,
      Youth everlasting.
      Sick and pale,
      Their beauty would perish,
      Old and weak,
      Wasting away,
  Were not Freia among them.

        [_Roughly._

  From their midst, therefore, Freia must forth!

WOTAN [_Aside._

      Loge lingers long!

FASOLT

      We wait for thy word!

WOTAN

      Ask some other wage!

FASOLT

      No other: Freia alone!

FAFNER

      Thou there, follow us!

        [_Fafner and Fasolt press towards Freia. Froh and
        Donner enter in haste._

FREIA

      Help! Help from the harsh ones!

FROH

      To me, Freia!

        [_Clasping Freia in his arms._ [_To Fafner._

      Back, overbold one!
      Froh shields the fair one!

DONNER [_Confronting the giants._

      Fasolt and Fafner,
      Have ye not felt
  With what weight my hammer falls?

FAFNER

      What means thy threat?

FASOLT

      What wouldst thou here?
  No strife we desire;
  We want but our due reward.

DONNER

      Oft I've doled out
      Giants their due:
  Come, your reward is here
  Waiting, full measure and more!

        [_He swings his hammer._

WOTAN

        [_Stretching out his spear between the combatants._

      Hold, thou fierce one!
      Nothing by force!
      All bonds and treaties
      My spear protects;
  Spare then thy hammer's haft!

FREIA

      Woe's me! Woe's me!
      Wotan forsakes me!

FRICKA

      Can such be thy thought,
      Merciless man?

WOTAN

        [_Turns away and sees Loge coming._


      There comes Loge!
      Hot is thy haste
      Smoothly to settle
  Thy sorry, badly-made bargain!

LOGE

        [_Has come up out of the valley in the background._

      What is this bargain
      That I am blamed for?--
      The one with the giants
  That thou thyself didst decide?
      O'er hill and o'er hollow
      Drives me my whim;
      House and hearth
      I do not crave.
      Donner and Froh,
  They dream but of roof and room:
      Wedding, must have
  A home in which to dwell,
      A stately hall,
      A fortress fast.
  It was such Wotan wished.
      Hall and house,
      Castle, court,
      The blissful abode
  Now stands complete and strong.
      I proved the lordly
      Pile myself;
      In fear of flaws,
      Scanning it close.
      Fasolt and Fafner
      Faithful I found;
  Firm-bedded is each stone.
      I was not slothful
      Like many here:
  Who calls me sluggard, he lies!

WOTAN

      Cunningly
      Thou wouldst escape!
      Warned be, and wisely
  Turn from attempts to deceive.
      Of all the Gods
      I alone stood by thee
      As thy friend,
  In the gang that trusted thee not.
  Now speak, and to the point!
  For when the builders at first
  As wage Freia demanded,
      I gave way only,
      Trusting thy word
  When thou didst solemnly promise
  To ransom the noble pledge.

LOGE

      Perplexed to puzzle,
      Plans to ponder
      For its redeeming--
  That promise I gave;
      But to discover
      What cannot be,
      What none can do,
  No man can possibly promise.

FRICKA

      See the treacherous
      Rogue thou didst trust!

FROH

      Named art Loge,
      But liar I call thee!

DONNER

      Accursèd flame,
      I will quench thy fire!

LOGE

      From their shame to shelter,
      Foolish folk flout me.

        [_Donner threatens to strike Loge._

WOTAN

        [_Stepping between them._

  Forbear and let him alone!
  Ye wot not Loge's wiles.
      His advice,
      Given slowly, gains
  Both in weight and in worth.

FAFNER

      Do not dally;
      Promptly pay!

FASOLT

    Long waits our reward.

WOTAN

        _Turns sternly to Loge._

      Speak up surly one!
      Fail me not!
  How far hast thou ranged and roamed?

LOGE

      Still with reproach
      Is Loge paid!
      Concerned but for thee,
      Thorough and swift,
      I searched and ransacked
      To the ends of the earth
  To find a ransom for Freia
  Fair to the giants and just.
      In vain the search,
      Convincing at last
      That the world contains
      Nothing so sweet
  That a man will take it instead
  Of woman's love and delight.

        [_All seem surprised and taken aback._

  Where life moves and has being,
  In water, earth and air
      I questioned,
      Asking of all things,
      Where weak still is strength,
      And germs only stirring,
      What men thought dear--
      And stronger deemed--
  Than woman's love and delight.
  But where life moves and has being
      My questions met
      But with laughter and scorn.
      In water, earth and air
      Woman and love
      Will none forego.

        [_Varied gestures of amazement._

      One man, one only,
      I met who, renouncing love,
      Prized ruddy gold
  Above any woman's grace.
  The Rhine's pure-gleaming children
  Told me of their sorrow.
      The Nibelung,
      Night-Alberich,
      Wooed for the favour
      Of the swimmers in vain,
      And vengeance took,
  Stealing the Rhinegold they guard.
      He thinks it now
      A thing beyond price,
  Greater than woman's grace.
      For their glittering toy
      Thus torn from the deep
  The sorrowful maids lamented.
      They pray, Wotan,
      Pleading to thee,
  That thy wrath may fall on the robber
      The gold too
      They would have thee grant them
      To guard in the water for ever.
      Loge promised
      The maidens to tell thee,
  And, keeping faith, he has told.

[Illustration: plate 07
    "The Rhine's pure-gleaming children
     Told me of their sorrow"]

WOTAN

      Dull thou must be
      Or downright knavish!
  In parlous plight myself,
  What help have I for others?

FASOLT

        [_Who has been listening attentively, to Fafner._

      The Niblung has much annoyed us;
      I greatly grudge him this Rhinegold;
      But such his craft and cunning,
      He has never been caught.

FAFNER

      Other malice
      Ponders the Niblung;
  Gains he might from gold
      Listen, Loge!
      Tell us the truth.
  What wondrous gift has the gold,
  That the dwarf desires it so?

LOGE

      A plaything,
      In the waves providing
  Children with laughter and sport,
      It gives, when to golden
      Ring it is rounded,
  Power and might unmatched;
  It wins its owner the world.

WOTAN [_Thoughtfully._

      Rumours I have heard
      Of the Rhinegold;
      Runes of riches
  Hide in its ruddy glow;
      Pelf and power
  Are by the ring bestowed.

FRICKA [_Softly to Loge._

      Could this gaud,
      This gleaming trinket
      Forged from the gold,
  Be worn by a woman too?

LOGE

      The wife who wore
      That glittering charm
      Never would lose
      Her husband's love--
  That charm which dwarfs are welding,
  Working in thrall to the ring.

FRICKA [_Coaxingly to Wotan._

      O could but my husband
      Come by the ring!

WOTAN

        _As if falling more and more under the influence of
        a spell._

      Methinks it were wisdom,
  Won I the ring to my service.
      But say, Loge,
      How shall I learn
  To forge and fashion it true?

LOGE

      A magic rune
  Can round the golden ring.
      No one knows it,
  Yet plain the spell to him
  Who happy love forswears.

        [_Wotan turns away in annoyance._

      That suits thee not;
      Thou art too late too.
  Alberich did not delay;
      Fearless he mastered
      The potent spell,

        [_Harshly._

  And wrought aright was the ring.

DONNER _To Wotan._

      We should all be
      Under the dwarf,
  Were not the ring from him wrested.

WOTAN

      The ring I must capture!

FROH

      Lightly now,
  Without cursing love it were won.

LOGE

      Just so:
  Without guile, as in children's games!

WOTAN

      Then tell us how.

LOGE

        By theft!
      What a thief stole
      Steal thou from the thief;
  How better could object be won?
      But with baleful arms
      Battles Alberich.
      Wary, wise
      Must be thy scheming,
  If the thief thou wouldst confound,

        _With warmth._

      And restore the ruddy
      And golden toy,
  The Rhinegold, to the maidens.
  For this they pray and implore.

WOTAN

      The river-maidens?
      What profit were mine?

FRICKA

      Of that billow-born brood
      Bring me no tidings,
      For they have wooed
      To my woe
  Full many a man to their caves.

        _Wotan stands silent, struggling with himself. The
        other Gods gaze at him in mute suspense. Fafner,
        meanwhile, has been consulting aside with Fasolt._

FAFNER

      Worth far more than Freia
      Were the glittering gold.
      Eternal youth, too, were his
      Who could use the charm in its quest.

        [_Fasolt's gestures indicate that he is being
        convinced against his will. Fafner and Fasolt
        approach Wotan again._

FAFNER

      Hear, Wotan,
      Our word while we wait;
  Freia we will restore you,
      And will take
      Paltrier payment:
  The Niblung's red-gleaming gold
  Will guerdon us giants rude.

WOTAN

      Ye must be mad!
      With what I possess not
  How can I, shameless ones, pay you?

FAFNER

      Hard labour
      Went to those walls;
      How easy
      With fraud-aided force
  (What our malice never achieved)
  The Niblung to break and bind!

[Illustration: Plate 08, Fasolt suddenly seizes Freia and drags her to
one side with Fafner]

WOTAN [_More quickly._

      Why should I make
      War on the Niblung?--
  Fight, your foe to confound?
      Insolent
      And greedily grasping
  Dolts you grow through my debt!

FASOLT

        [_Suddenly seizes Freia and drags her to one side
        with Fafner._

      Maiden, come!
      We claim thee ours!
  As pledge thou shalt be held
  Till the ransom is paid.

FREIA [_Screaming_.

  Woe's me! Woe's me! Woe!

FAFNER

      From your midst
      We bear her forth!
  Till evening--mark it well I--
  As a pledge she is ours.
      We will return then.
      But when we come,
  If the Rhinegold be not ready,
  The Rhinegold bright and red--

FASOLT

      The respite is ended,
      Freia is forfeit
  And bides among us for aye!

FREIA

      Sister! Brothers!
      Save me! Help!

        [_The giants hasten off, dragging Freia with them._

FROH

      Up! Follow fast!

DONNER

      Fall now the heavens!

        [_They look inquiringly at Wotan._

FREIA [_In the distance._

      Save me! Help!

LOGE [_Looking after the giants._

  Downward over stock and stone
      Striding they go;
  Through the ford across the Rhine
      Wade now the robbers.
      Sad at heart
      Hangs Freia,
  Thrown rudely over rough shoulders!
      Heia! hei!
  The louts, how they lumber along!
  Through the Rhine valley they reel.
      Not till Riesenheim's march
      Is reached will they rest!

        [_He turns to the Gods._


  How darkly Wotan doth dream!
  What ails the high, happy Gods?

        [_A pale mist, gradually increasing in density,
        fills the stage. Seen through it the Gods look more
        and more wan and aged. All stand in dismay and
        apprehension regarding Wotan, whose eyes are fixed
        broodingly on the ground._

LOGE

       Does a mist mock me?
       Tricks me a dream?
       Dismayed and wan,
       How swiftly ye fade!
   Lo! the bloom forsakes your cheeks,
   And quenched is the light of your eyes!
       Courage, Froh!
   Day's but begun!
       From thy hand, Donner,
       The hammer is falling!
       And why frets Fricka?
       Sees she with sorrow
   That Wotan's hair, growing grey,
   Has made him gloomy and old?

FRICKA

      Woe's me! Woe's me!
      What does it mean?

[Illustration: Plate 09, The Gods grow wan and aged at the loss of Freia.]

DONNER

      My hand sinks down.

FROH

      My heart stands still.

LOGE

  I have it: hear what ye lack!
      Of Freia's fruit
  Ye have not partaken to-day.
      The golden apples
      Within her garden
  Restored you your strength and your youth,
  Ate ye thereof each day.
      The garden's guardian
      In pledge has been given.
      On the branches dries
      And droops the fruit,
  To drop soon and decay.
      My loss is lighter,
  For still did Freia,
      Stingy to me,
  Stint the delectable fruit.
      Not half as godlike
  Am I, ye high ones, as you!

        [_Freely, but quickly and harshly._

      But ye trusted solely
      To the fruit that makes young,
  As well both the giants wist.
      Your life they played for,
      Plotted to take;
  Contrive so that they fail.
      Lacking the apples,
      Old and worn,
      Grey and weary,
  Wasting, the scoff of the world,
  The Gods must pine and pass.

FRICKA [_Anxiously_

      Wotan, alas!
      Unhappy man!
      See what thy laughing
      Lightness has brought us--
  Scoff and scorn for all!

WOTAN [_Coming to a sudden resolve, starts up._

      Up, Loge,
      And follow me!
  To Nibelheim hastening downward,
  I go in search of the gold.

LOGE

      The Rhine-daughters
      Thy aid invoked:
  Not vainly they hoped for thy help then?

WOTAN [_Angrily._

      Fool, be silent!
      Freia, the fair one--
  Freia's ransom we go for.

LOGE

      Where thou wouldst go
      Gladly I lead.
      Shall we dive
  Sheer through the depths of the Rhine?

WOTAN

      Not through the Rhine.

LOGE

      Then swift let us swing
      Through this smoky chasm.
  Together, come, creep we in!

        [_He goes in front and vanijhes at the side through
        a cleft, from which, immediately afterwards,
        sulphurous vapour streams forth._

WOTAN

      Ye others wait
      Till evening here;
      The golden ransom
  When got will again make us young.

        [_He descends after Loge into the chasm. The
        sulphurous vapour which rises from it spreads over
        the whole stage and quickly fills it with thick
        clouds. Those who remain behind are soon hidden._

DONNER

      Fare thee well, Wotan!

FROH

      Good luck! Good luck!

FRICKA

      O come back soon
      To thy sorrowing wife!

        [_The sulphurous vapour darkens till it becomes a
        black cloud, which rises upwards from below. This
        then changes to a dark, rocky cavern which keeps
        rising, so that the stage seems to sink deeper and
        deeper into the earth._




THIRD SCENE


_From various points in the distance ruddy lights gleam out. An
increasing clamour, as of smiths at work, is heard on all sides. The
clang of the anvils dies away. A vast subterranean chasm becomes
visible which seems to open into narrow gorges on all sides. Alberich
drags the screaming Mime out of a side cleft._



ALBERICH

      Héhé! Héhé!
      Come here! Come here!
      Mischievous dwarf!
      Prettily pinched
      Promptly thou'lt be
      Hast thou not ready,
      Wrought to my wish,
  The dainty thing I desire!

MIME [_Howling._

      Ohé! Ohé!
      Oh! Oh!
      Let me alone!
      It is forged;
      Heeding thy hest
      I laboured hard
      Till it was done!
  Take but thy nails from my ear!

ALBERICH

      Then why this delay
      To show thy work?

MIME

      I feared that something
      Might still be wanting.

[Illustration: Plate 10
    MIME, howling.
        "Ohé! Ohé!
        Oh! Oh!"]

ALBERICH

      What is there to finish?

MIME [_Embarrassed._

      Here--and there----

ALBERICH

      How here and there?
      Hand me the thing!

        [_He tries to catch hold of his ear again. In his
        terror Mime drops a piece of metal-work which he
        has been clutching convulsively. Alberich picks it
        up hastily and examines it with care._

      Rogue, observe!
      See how all wrought is
      Well finished and feat,
      Done as desired!
      The simpleton wants
      Slyly to trick me
      And keep by cunning
      The wonderful work,
      Though all his skill
      Came alone from my craft.
  Thou art discovered, thief.

        [_He puts the Tarnhelm on his head._

  The helmet fits the head;
  But will the spell prosper too?

        [_Very softly._

      "Night and darkness,
      Seen of none!"

        [_He vanishes, and a pillar of cloud takes his
        place._

      Brother, canst see me?

MIME [_Looks round in amaze._

  Where art thou? I see no one.

ALBERICH [_Invisible._

      Then feel me instead,
      Thou lazy scamp!
  Take that for thy thievish thoughts!

MIME

        [_Writhes under the lathes he receives, the sound
        of which is heard without the whip being seen._

      Ohé! Ohé!
      Oh! Oh! Oh!

ALBERICH [_Invisible and laughing._

      Ha! ha! ha!
      Ha! ha! ha!
      I thank thee, blockhead;
  Thy work has stood the test.
      Hoho! Hoho!
      Nibelungs all
      Bow now to Alberich!
      For he is everywhere,
      Waiting and watching;
      Peace and rest
      Are past for ever;
      Ye must all serve him,
      Though see him can none;
      Where he cannot be spied
      Look out for his coming;
  None shall escape from his thraldom!

[_Harshly._

      Hoho! hoho!
      Hearken, he nears:
      The Nibelung's lord!

        [_The pillar of cloud disappears in the background.
        Alberich's scolding voice is heard more and more
        faintly. Mime lies huddled up in pain. Wotan and
        Loge come down through a cleft in the rock._

LOGE
      Nibelheim here.
      Through pale mists gleaming,
  How bright yonder fiery sparks glimmer!

MIME
      Oh! Oh! Oh!

WOTAN

      I hear loud groans.
      Who lies on the ground?

[Illustration: Plate 11, Mime writhes under the lashes he receives.]

LOGE [_Bends over Mime._

      Why all this whimpering noise?

MIME

      Ohé! Ohé!
      Oh! Oh!

LOGE

      Hei, Mime! Merry dwarf!
      Who beats and bullies thee so?

MIME

      Leave me in peace, pray.

LOGE

      So much is certain,
      And more still. Hark!
  Help I promise thee, Mime!

        [_He raises him with difficulty._

MIME

      What help for me?
      To do his bidding
      My brother can force me,
  For I am bound as his slave.

LOGE

      But, Mime, how has he
      Thus made thee his thrall?

MIME

      By evil arts
      Fashioned Alberich
      A yellow ring,
      From the Rhinegold forged,
      At whose mighty magic
      Trembling we marvel;
  This spell puts in his power
  The Nibelung hosts of night.
      Happy we smiths
      Moulded and hammered,
      Making our women
      Trinkets to wear--
  Exquisite Nibelung toys--
  And lightly laughed at our toil.
      The rogue now compels us
      To creep into caverns,
      For him alone
      To labour unthanked.
      Through the golden ring
      His greed can divine
      Where untouched treasure
      In hidden gorge gleams.
      We still must keep spying,
      Peering and delving:
      Must melt the booty,
      Which, molten, we forge
      Without pause or peace,
  To heap up higher his hoard.

LOGE

      Just now, then, an idler
      Roused him to wrath?

MIME

      Poor Mime, ah!
      My lot was the hardest.
      I had to work,
      Forging a helmet,
      With strict instructions
      How to contrive it;
      And well I marked
      The wondrous might
      Bestowed by the helm
      That from steel I wrought.
      Hence I had gladly
      Held it as mine,
      And, by its virtue
  Risen at last in revolt:
      Perchance, yes, perchance
  The master himself I had mastered,
  And, he in my power, had wrested
  The ring from him and used it
  That he might serve me, the free man,

        [_Harshly_

    As now I must serve him, a slave!

LOGE

      And wherefore, wise one,
      Sped not the plan?

MIME

  Ah! though the helm I fashioned,
  The magic that lurks therein
  I foolishly failed to divine.
      He who set the task
      And seized the fruits--
      From him I have learnt,
      Alas I but too late!
  All the helmet's cunning craft.
      From my sight he vanished,
      But, viciously lashing,
  Swung his arm through unseen.

        [_Howling and sobbing._

      This, fool that I am,
      Was all my thanks!

        [_He rubs his back. Wotan and Loge laugh._

LOGE [_To Wotan._

      Confess, our task
      Will call for skill.

WOTAN

      Yet the foe will yield,
      Use thou but fraud.

MIME [_Observes the Gods more attentively._

      Who are you, ye strangers
      That ask all these questions?

LOGE

      Friends to thee,
      Who from their straits
  Will free all the Nibelung folk.

MIME [_Shrinking back in fear when he hears Alberich returning._

      Hark! Have a care!
      Alberich comes!

        [He runs to and fro in terror.

WOTAN

      We'll wait for him here.

        [_He sits down calmly on a stone. Alberich, who
        has taken the Tarnhelm from his head and hung it
        on his girdle, is brandishing his scourge and
        driving before him a band of Nibelungs from the
        gorges below. These are laden with gold and silver
        treasure, which, urged on by Alberich, they pile up
        so as to form a large heap._

ALBERICH

      Hither! Thither!
      Héhé! Hoho!
      Lazy herd!
      Haste and heap
      Higher the hoard.
      Up with thee there!
      On with thee here!
      Indolent dolts,
      Down with the treasure!
      Need ye my urging?
      Here with it all!

        [_He suddenly perceives Wotan and Loge._

      Hey! Who are they
      That thus intrude?
      Mime! Come here!
      Rascally rogue!
      Gossiping art
      With the pilgriming pair?
      Off, thou idler!
  Back to thy bellows and beating!

        [_Lashing Mime, he chases him into the crowd of
        Nibelungs._

      Hey! to your labour!
      Get ye all hence now!
      Swing ye down swift!
  From the virgin gorges
  Get me the gold!
  This whip will follow,
  Delve ye not fast!
  That labour ye shirk not
  Mime be surety,
  Or surely the lash
  Of my whip will find him;
  That where no one would guess
  I watch and I wander,
  None knows it better than he.
  Loitering still?
  Lingering there?

[Illustration: Plate 12, Alberich drives in a band of Nibelungs laden with gold
and silver treasure.]

        [_He pulls the ring from his finger, kisses it and
        stretches it out in menace._

      Fear ye and tremble,
      O fallen host,
      And obey
      The ring's dread lord!

        [_Howling and shrieking, the Nibelungs, among them
        Mime, scatter, and creep down into the clefts in
        all directions._

ALBERICH

      What seek ye here?

        [_Looks long and distrustfully at Wotan and Loge._

WOTAN

  From Nibelheim's gloomy realm
  Strange tidings have travelled up,
      Tales of wonders
      Worked here by Alberich;
      And, greedy of marvels,
  Hither came we as guests.

ALBERICH

      By envy urged,
      Hither ye hie.
      Such doughty guests
  I do not mistake.

LOGE

      Since I am known,
      Ignorant elf,
      Say then, with growling
      Whom dost thou greet?
      In caverns cold
      Where once thou didst crouch,
      Who gave thee light
      And fire for thy comfort,
  Had Loge not smiled on thee?
      Or what hadst thou fashioned
  Had not I heated thy forge?
      I am thy kinsman
      And once was kind:
  Lukewarm, methinks, are thy thanks!

ALBERICH

       On light-born elves
       Laughs now Loge,
       The crafty rogue:
   Art thou, false one, their friend
   As my friend thou wert once,
       Haha! I laugh!
   No harm from such need I fear.

LOGE

      No cause then for thy distrust.

ALBERICH

      I can trust thy falsehood,
      Not thy good faith!

        [_Taking up a defiant attitude._

  Yet I dare you all unflinching.

LOGE

      'Tis thy might
      That makes thee so bold;
      Grimly great
      Groweth thy power.

ALBERICH

      Seest thou the hoard
      Yonder heaped
      High by my host?

LOGE

  A richer one never was seen.

ALBERICH

      A wretched pile
      Is this to-day, though.
      Boldly mounting,
  'Twill be bigger henceforward.

WOTAN

  But what is gained by the hoard
  In joyless Nibelheim,
  Where wealth finds nothing to buy?

ALBERICH

      Treasure to gather
      And treasure to garner--
  Thereto Nibelheim serves.
      But with the hoard
      In the caverns upheaped
  Wonders all wonder surpassing
      Will I perform
  And win the whole world and its fairness.

WOTAN

      But, my friend, how compass that goal?

ALBERICH

  Ye who live above and breathe
      The balmy, sweet airs,
      Love and laugh:
      A hand of gold
  Ere long, O ye Gods, will have gripped you!
  As I forswore love, even so
      No one alive
      But shall forswear it;
      By golden songs wooed,
  For gold alone will his greed be.
      On hills of delight
      Your home is, where gladness
      Softly lulls;
      The dark elves
  Ye despise, O deathless carousers!
      Beware!
      Beware!
      For first your men
      Shall bow to my might;
      Then your women fair
      Who my wooing spurned
  The dwarf will force to his will,
  Though frowned on by love.

        [_Laughing savagely._

      Ha! ha! ha! ha!
      Mark ye my word?
      Beware!
  Beware of the hosts of the night,
  When rise shall the Nibelung hoard
  From silent depths to the day!

WOTAN [_Furiously._

      Avaunt, impious fool!

ALBERICH

      What says he?

LOGE [_Stepping between them._

      Cease from thy folly!

        [_To Alberich._

  Who would gaze not in wonder,
  Beholding Alberich's work?
  If only thy skill can achieve
  Everything hope has promised,
  Almighty I needs must acclaim thee!
      For moon and stars
      And the sun in his glory,
  Forced to do thee obeisance,
  Even they must bow down.
  But what would seem of most moment
      Is that they who serve thee,
      The Nibelung hosts,
  Bow and bear no hate.
  When thy hand held forth a ring
  Thy folk were stricken with fear.
      But in thy sleep
      A thief might slip up
  And steal slyly the ring.
  Say, how wouldst thou save thyself then?

ALBERICH

  Most shrewd to himself seems Loge;
      Others always
      Figure as fools.
      If I had to ask for
      Advice or aid
      On bitter terms,
  How happy the thief would be!
      This helmet that hides
      I schemed for myself,
      And chose for its smith
  Mime, finest of forgers.
      I am now able
      Swift to assume
      Any form that I fancy,
      Through the helm.
      No one sees me,
      Search as he will;
      Though everywhere hidden,
      I always am there.
      So, fearing nothing,
  Even from thee I am safe,
  Most kind, careful of friends!

LOGE

      I have met
      Full many a marvel,
      But one so wondrous
      Have never known.
      Achievement so matchless
      Scarce can I credit.
  Were this possible, truly
  Thy might indeed were eternal.

ALBERICH

      Dost thou believe
      I lie, as would Loge?

LOGE

      Till it is proved
  I must suspect thy word.

ALBERICH

      Puffed up with wisdom,
      The fool will explode soon:
      Of envy then die!
  Decide to what I shall change;
  In that form I shall stand.

LOGE

      Nay, choose for thyself,
  But strike me dumb with amaze.

ALBERICH [_Puts the Tarnhelm on his head._

      "Dragon dread,
      Wreathe thou and wriggle!"

        [_He immediately disappears. An enormous serpent
        writhes on the floor in his place. It rears and
        threatens Wotan and Loge with its open jaws._

LOGE [_Pretends to be terrified._

      Ohé!

ALBERICH [_Laughing._

  Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!

LOGE

      Ohé! Ohé!
      Horrible dragon,
      O swallow me not!
  Spare the life of poor Loge!

WOTAN

      Good, Alberich!
      Well done, rascal!
      How swiftly grew
  The dwarf to the dragon immense!

        [_The dragon disappears and, in its stead, Alberich
        is again seen in his own shape._

ALBERICH

      He he! Ye scoffers,
      Are ye convinced?

[Illustration: Plate 13
       "Ohé! Ohé!
        Horrible dragon,
        O swallow me not!
    Spare the life of poor Loge!"]

LOGE [_In a trembling voice._

  My trembling tells thee how truly.
      A giant snake
      Thou wert in a trice.
      Having beheld,
  I just credit the wonder.
      Couldest thou turn
      To something quite tiny
      As well as bigger?
  Methinks that way were best
  For slyly slipping from foes;
  That, though, I fear were too hard!

ALBERICH

      For thee, yes;
      Thou art so dull!
      How small shall I be?

LOGE

  The most cramped of crannies must hold thee
  That hides the timorous toad.

ALBERICH

      Nothing simpler!
      Look at me now!

        [_He puts the Tarnhelm on his head again._

      "Crooked toad,
      Creep and crawl there!"

        [_He vanishes. The Gods see a toad on the rocks
        creeping towards them._

LOGE [_To Wotan._

      Quick and catch it!
      Capture the toad!

        [_Wotan sets his foot on the toad. Loge makes a
        dash at its head and holds the Tarnhelm in his
        hand._

ALBERICH

        [_Is suddenly seen in his own shape writhing under
        Wotan's foot._

      Ohé! I'm caught!
      My curse upon them!

LOGE

      Hold him fast
      Till he is bound.

        [_Loge binds his hands and feet with a rope._

      Now swiftly up!
      Then he is ours.

        [_Both seize hold of the prisoner, who struggles
        violently, and drag him towards the shaft by which
        they descended. They disappear mounting upwards._




FOURTH SCENE


        _The scene has changed as before, only in reverse
        order. Open space on mountain heights. The prospect
        is veiled by pale mist as at the end of the second
        scene. Wotan and Loge climb up out of the cavern,
        bringing with them Alberich bound._



LOGE

      Here, kinsman,
      Thou canst sit down!
      Friend, look round thee;
      There lies the world
  That was thine for the winning, thou fool!
      What corner, say,
  Wilt give to me for my stall?

        [_He dances round Alberich, snapping his fingers._

ALBERICH

      Infamous robber!
      Thou knave! Thou rogue!
      Loosen the rope,
      Set me at large,
  Or dear for this outrage shalt answer!

WOTAN

      My captive art thou,
      Caught and in fetters.
      As thou hadst fain
      Subdued the world
  And all that the world containeth,
  Thou liest bound at my feet,
  And, coward, canst not deny it.
      A ransom alone
      Shall loose thee from bondage.

ALBERICH

      Ah, the dolt,
      The dreamer I was,
      To trust blindly
      The treacherous thief!
      Fearful revenge
      Shall follow this wrong!

LOGE

      Vain talk this of vengeance
  Before thy freedom is won.
      To a man in bonds
  No free man expiates outrage.
      If vengeance thou dreamest,
      Dream of the ransom
  First without further delay!

        [_He shows him the kind of ransom by snapping his
        fingers._

ALBERICH

  Declare then your demands.

WOTAN

  The hoard and thy gleaming gold.

ALBERICH

  Pack of unscrupulous thieves!

        [_Aside._

  If I only can keep the ring,
  The hoard I can lightly let go,
      For anew I could win it
      And add to its worth
  By the powerful spell of the ring.
      If as warning it serves
      To make me more wise,
  The warning will not have been lost,
  Even though lost may be the gold.

WOTAN

      Wilt yield up the hoard?

ALBERICH

     Loosen my hand
     To summon it here.

        [_Loge frees his right hand._

ALBERICH

        [_Touches the ring with his lips and secretly
        murmurs the command._

      Behold the Nibelungs
      Hither are called;
      I can hear them coming,
      Bid by their lord,
  With the hoard from the depths to the day.
  Now loosen these burdensome bonds.

WOTAN

      Nay, first in full thou must pay.

        [_The Nibelungs come up out of the cleft laden with
        the objects of which the hoard is composed._

ALBERICH

      O bitter disgrace
      That my shrinking bondsmen
  Should see me captive and bound!

        [_To the Nibelungs._

      Lay it down there,
      As ye are bid!
      In a heap
      Pile up the hoard.
      Must I aid, idlers?
      No spying at me!
      Haste there! Haste!
      Then get ye gone quickly.
      Hence to your work.
      Home to your gorges!
  Let the sluggards beware,
  For I follow hard at your heels!

        [_He kisses the ring and holds it out with an air
        of command. As struck with a blow, the Nibelungs
        press terrified and cowering towards the cleft,
        down which they hastily disappear._

ALBERICH

      The price is paid;
      Let me depart!
      And that helm of mine
      Which Loge still holds,
  That also pray give me again!

LOGE

        _Throwing the Tarnhelm on to the heap._

  The plunder must pay for the pardon.

ALBERICH

      Accursed thief!
      But patience! Calm!
      He who moulded the one
      Makes me another;
      Still mine is the might
      That Mime obeys.
      Loath indeed
      Am I to leave
  My cunning defence to the foe!
      Nothing Alberich
      Owns at all now;
  Unbind, ye tyrants, his bonds!

LOGE [_To Wotan._

      Ought I to free him?
      Art thou content?

WOTAN

      A golden ring
      Girdles thy finger:
      Hearest, elf?
  That also belongs to the hoard.

ALBERICH  [_Horrified._

      The ring?

WOTAN

     The ring must also
     Go to the ransom.

ALBERICH [_Trembling._

     My life--but the ring: not that!

WOTAN [_With greater violence._

      The ring I covet;
  For thy life I care not at all.

ALBERICH

  But if my life I ransom
  The ring I must also rescue
      Hand and head,
      Eye and ear
  Are not mine more truly
  Than mine is the ruddy ring!

WOTAN

  The ring thou claimest as thine?
  Impudent elf, thou art raving.
      Tell the truth;
      Whence was gotten the gold
  To fashion the glittering gaud?
      How could that be
      Thine which reft was,
  Thou rogue, from watery deeps?
      To the Rhine's fair daughters
      Down and inquire
      If the gold
      Was as gift to thee given
  That thou didst thieve for the ring!

ALBERICH

      Vile double-dealing!
      Shameless deceit!
      Wouldst thou, robber,
      Reproach in me
  The sin so sweet to thyself?
      How fain thou hadst
  Bereft the Rhine of its gold,
      If it had been
  As easy to forge as to steal!
      How well for thee,
      Thou unctuous knave,
      That the Nibelung, stung
      By shameful defeat,
      And by fury driven,
  Was fired into winning the spell
  That now alluringly smiles!
      Shall I, bliss debarred,
      Anguish-burdened
      Because of the
      Curse-laden deed,
      My ring as a toy
  Grant to princes for pleasure,
  My ban bringing blessing to thee?
      Have a care,
      Arrogant God!
      My sin was one
  Concerning myself alone:
  But against all that was,
      Is and shall be
  Thou wouldst wantonly sin,
  Eternal one, taking the ring.

WOTAN

      Yield the ring!
      Thy foolish talk
  Gives no title to that.

        [_He seizes Alberich and draws the ring from his
        finger by force._

ALBERICH  [_With a frightful cry._

    Woe! Defeated! Undone!
    Of wretches the wretchedest slave!

WOTAN [_Contemplating the ring._

    I own what makes me supreme,
    The mightiest lord of all lords!

        [_He puts on the ring._

LOGE [_To Wotan._

    Shall he go free?

WOTAN

    Loose his bonds.

LOGE [_Sets Alberich quite free._

      Slip away home,
      For no fetter binds thee!
  Fare forth, thou art free!

ALBERICH [_Raising himself with furious laughter._

      Am I now free,
      Free in truth?
      My freedom's first
  Greeting take, for it is thine!
  As a curse gave me the ring,
  My curse go with the ring!
      As its gold
  Gave measureless might,
      May now its magic
  Deal death evermore!
      No man shall gain
      Gladness therefrom;
      May ill-fortune befall him
      On whom it shines.
      Fretted by care
      Be he who shall hold it,
      And he who doth not,
      By envy be gnawed!
      All shall covet
      And crave its wealth,
      Yet none shall it profit
      Or pay when won.
  Those who guard it nothing shall gain,
  Yet shall murder go where they go.
      The coward, death-doomed,
  By fetters of fear shall be bound;
      His whole life long
  He shall languish to death--
      The ring's proud lord
      And its poorest slave--
      Till again I have
  In my hand the gold I was robbed of.
      So blesses
      The Nibelung
  The ring in bitter despair!
      Hold fast to it!

        [Laughing.

    Keep it with care;

        [Grimly.

    From my curse none shall escape!

        [_He vanishes quickly through the cleft. The thick
        mist in the foreground gradually clears away._

LOGE

       Hadst thou ears
       For his fond farewell?

WOTAN [_Left in contemplation of the ring._

  Grudge him not vent to his spleen!

        [_It keeps growing lighter._

LOGE [_Looking to the right._

      Fasolt and Fafner
      Come from afar
  Bringing Freia again.

        [_Through the vanishing mist Donner, Froh, and
        Fricka appear, and hasten towards the foreground._

FROH

      The giants return.

DONNER

      Be greeted, brother!

FRICKA [_Anxiously to Wotan._

      Dost bring joyful tidings?

LOGE [_Pointing to the hoard._

      By fraud and by force
      We have prevailed:
  There Freia's ransom lies.

DONNER

      From the giant's grasp
      Freed comes the fair one.

FROH

      How sweetly the air
      Fans us again!
      Balmy delights
      Steal soft through each sense!
  Sad, forlorn had our lot been,
  For ever severed from her
  Who gives us youth everlasting,
  And bliss triumphant o'er pain.

        [_Fasolt and Fafner enter, leading Freia between
        them. Fricka hastens joyfully towards her sister.
        The foreground has become quite bright again, the
        light restoring to the aspect of the Gods its
        original freshnesh. The background, however, is
        still veiled by the mist so that the distant castle
        remains invisible._

FRICKA

      Sweetest of sisters!
      Lovely delight!
  Once more for mine have I won thee!

FASOLT [_Keeping her off_

      Hold! Touch her not yet!
      Freia still is ours.
      On Riesenheim's
      Rampart of rock
      Resting we stayed.
      The pledge we held
      In our hands we used
      Loyally.
      With deep regret,
      I bring her back now
      In case ye brothers
      Can ransom her.

WOTAN

  Prepared lies the ransom;
      Mete out the gold,
  Giving generous measure.

FASOLT

      In truth it grieves me
  Greatly the woman to lose;
  And that my heart may forget her
      Ye must heap the hoard,
      Pile it so high
      That it shall hide
  The blossom-sweet maid from mine eyes!

WOTAN

      Be Freia's form
      The gauge of the gold.

        [_Freia is placed in the middle by the two giants,
        who then stick their staves into the ground in
        front of her so that her height and breadth is
        indicated._

FAFNER

       Our staves give the measure
       Of Freia's form;
   Thus high now heap ye the hoard.

WOTAN

      On with the work:
      Irksome I find it!

LOGE

      Help me, Froh!

FROH

      I will end
      Freia's dishonour.

        [_Loge and Froh heap up the treasure hastily
        between the staves._

FAFNER

      Let the pile
      Less loosely be built;
      Firm and close
      Pack ye the gauge!

        [_He presses down the treasure with rude strength;
        he bends down to look for gaps._

      I still can see through;
      Come, fill up the crannies!

LOGE

      Hands off, rude fellow!
      Touch nothing here!

FAFNER

  Come here! This gap must be closed!

WOTAN [_Turning away angrily._

      Deep in my breast
      Burns the disgrace!

FRICKA

      See how in shame
  Beautiful Freia stands;
      For release she asks,
  Dumb, with sorrowful eyes.
      Heartless man!
  The lovely one owes this to thee!

FAFNER

      Still more! Pile on still more.

DONNER

      My patience fails;
      Mad is the wrath
  Roused by this insolent rogue!
      Come hither, hound!
      Measure must thou?
  Thy strength then measure with mine!

FAFNER

      Softly, Donner!
      Roar where it serves;
  Thy roar is impotent here.

DONNER [_Lunging out at him._

      It will crush thee to thy cost, rogue.

WOTAN

      Calm thyself!
  Methinks that Freia is hid.

LOGE

      The hoard is spent.

FAFNER

        [_Measures the hoard carefully with his eye, and
        looks to see if there are any crevices._

  Still shines to me Holda's hair.
      Yonder thing, too,
      Throw on the hoard!

LOGE

      Even the helm?

FAFNER

      Make haste! Here with it!

WOTAN

      Let it go also!

LOGE [_Throws the Tarnhelm on the heap._

      At last we have finished.
      Have ye enough now?

FASOLT

      Freia, the fair,
      Is hidden for aye!
      The price has been paid.
      Ah, have I lost her?

        [_He goes up to the hoard and peers through it._

      Sadly shine
      Her eyes on me still,
      Like stars they beam
      Softly on me;
      Still through this chink
      I look on their light.

        [_Beside himself._

  While her sweet eyes I behold thus,
  From the woman how can I part?

FAFNER

      Hey! Come hither,
      And stop me this cranny!

LOGE

      Greedy grumblers!
      Can ye not see
  The gold is all gone?

FAFNER

      Not the whole, friend!
      On Wotan's finger
  Shines a golden ring still;
  Give that to close up the crevice!

WOTAN

      What! Give my ring?

LOGE

      Be ye counselled!
      The Rhine-Maidens
      Must have the gold;
  Wotan will give them what theirs is.

[Illustration: Plate 14
    FAFNER.
    "Hey! Come hither,
     And stop me this cranny!"]

WOTAN

      What nonsense is this?
  The ring I won so hardly,
  Undismayed I hold and will keep.

LOGE

      Broken then
      Must be the promise
  I gave the maidens who grieved.

WOTAN

    By thy promise I am not bound;
    As booty mine is the ring.

FAFNER

      Not so. The ring
  Must go with the ransom.

WOTAN

  Boldly ask what ye will:
      It shall be granted;
      But not for all
  The world would I give you the ring.

FASOLT [_Furious, pulls Freia from behind the hoard._

      All is off!
      The bargain stands:
  Fair Freia ours is for ever!

FREIA

    Help me! Help me!

FRICKA

    Heartless God,
    Grant it! Give way!

FROH

    Keep not the gold back!

DONNER

    Give them the ring too!

WOTAN

    Let me alone!
    I hold to the ring.

        [_Fafner stops Fasolt as he is hastening off. All
        stand dismayed; Wotan turns from them in anger. The
        stage has grown dark again. From a cleft in the
        rock on one side issues a bluish flame in which
        Erda suddenly becomes visible, rising so that her
        upper half is seen._

ERDA [_Stretching out a warning hand towards Wotan._

  Yield it, Wotan! Yield it!
  Flee the ring's dread curse!
      Awful
      And utter disaster
  It will doom thee to.

WOTAN

  What woman woe thus foretells?

ERDA

  All things that were I know,
      And things that are;
      All things that shall be
      I foresee.
      The endless world's
      Ur-Wala,
  Erda, bids thee beware.
      Ere the earth was,
      Of my womb born
      Were daughters three;
      And my knowledge
  Nightly the Norns tell to Wotan.
      Now summoned by
      Danger most dire,
      I myself come.
  Hearken! Hearken! Hearken!
  All things will end shortly;
      And for the Gods
      Dark days are dawning!
  Be counselled; keep not the ring!

        [_Erda sinks slowly as far as the breast, while the
        bluish light grows fainter._

WOTAN

      A mystic might
      Rang in thy words.
  Tarry, and tell me further.

ERDA [_Disappearing._

      Thou hast been warned;
      Enough dost know;
  Weigh my words with fear!

        [_She vanishes completely._

[Illustration: Plate 15, "Erda bids thee beware"]

WOTAN

  If thus doomed to foreboding--
      I must detain thee
      Till all is answered!

        [_Wotan is about to follow Erda in order to detain
        her. Froh and Fricka throw themselves in his way
        and prevent him._

FRICKA

    What meanest thou, madman?

FROH

    Go not, Wotan!
    Fear thou the warner,
    Heed her words well!

        [_Wotan gazes thoughtfully before him._

DONNER [_Turning to the giants with a resolute air._

      Hark, ye giants!
      Come back and wait still!
  The gold we give you also.

FRICKA

      Ah, dare I hope it?
      Deem ye Holda
  Worthy of such a price?

        [_All look at Wotan in suspense; he, rousing
        himself from deep thought, grasps his spear and
        swings it in token of having come to a bold
        decision._

WOTAN

      To me, Freia,
      For thou art free!
      Bought back for aye,
  Youth everlasting, return!
  Here, giants, take ye the ring!

        [He throws the ring on the hoard. The giants
        release Freia; she hastens joyfully to the Gods,
        who caress her in turns for a space, with every
        manifestation of delight.

FASOLT [_To Fafner._

      Hold there, greedy one!
      Grant me my portion!
      Honest division
      Best for both is.

FAFNER

  More on the maid than the gold
  Thou wert set, love-sick fool,
      And much against
      Thy will the exchange was.
      Sharing not, Freia
  Thou wouldst have wooed for thy bride;
      Sharing the gold,
      It is but just
  That the most of it should be mine.

FASOLT

      Infamous thief!
      Taunts? And to me!

        [_To the Gods._

  Come judge ye between us;
      Halve ye the hoard
      As seems to you just!

        [_Wotan turns away in contempt._

      Let him have the treasure;
      Hold to what matters: the ring!

FASOLT

        [_Falls upon Fafner, who has meanwhile been
        steadily packing up the treasure._

      Back, brazen rascal!
      Mine is the ring.
  I lost for it Freia's smile.

        [_He snatches haply at the ring._

      Off with thy hands!
      The ring is mine.

        [_There is a struggle. Fasolt tears the ring from
        Fafner._

FASOLT

      I hold it. It is mine now!

FAFNER

      Hold fast, lest it should fall!

        [_Lunging out with his stave, he fells Fasolt to
        the ground with one blow; from the dying man he
        then hastily tears the ring._

      Now feast upon Freia's smile:
      No more shalt thou touch the ring!

        [_He puts the ring into the sack and tranquilly
        continues to pack up the rest of the hoard. All the
        Gods stand horrified. A solemn silence._

[Illustration: Plate 16, Fafner kills Fasolt.]

WOTAN

      Dread indeed
  I find is the curse's might.

LOGE

      Unmatched, Wotan,
      Surely thy luck is!
      Great thy gain was
      In getting the ring;
      But the gain of its loss
      Is gain greater still:
      There thy foemen, see,
      Slaughter thy foes
  For the gold thou hast let go.

WOTAN

  Dark forebodings oppress me!
      Care and fear
      Fetter my soul;
      Erda must teach me,
      Tell how to end them:
      To her I must descend.

FRICKA [_Caressing and coaxing him._

      Why linger, Wotan?
      Beckon they not,
      The stately walls,
      Waiting to offer
  Welcome kind to their lord?

WOTAN [_Gloomily._

      With wage accurst
      Paid was their cost.

DONNER [_Pointing to the background, which is still
       enveloped in mist._

      Heavily mists
      Hang in the air;
      Gloomy, wearisome
      Is their weight!
      The wan-visaged clouds
  Charged with their storms I will gather,
  And sweep the blue heavens clean.

        [_Donner mounts a high rock on the edge of the
        precipice, and swings his hammer; during what
        follows the mists gather round him._

  Hey da! Hey da! Hey do!
      To me, O ye mists!
      Ye vapours, to me!
      Donner, your lord,
      Summons his hosts!

        [_He swings his hammer._

      To my hammer's swing
      Hitherward sweep
      Vapours and fogs!
      Hovering mists!
  Donner, your lord, summons his hosts!
      Hey da! Hey da! Hey do!

        [_Donner disappears completely in a thunder-cloud
        which has been growing darker and denser. The
        stroke of his hammer is heard falling heavily on
        the rock. A vivid flash of lightning comes from the
        cloud, followed by a loud clap of thunder. Froh has
        also disappeared in the cloud._

DONNER [_Invisible._

      Brother, to me!
  Show them the way by the bridge!

        [_Suddenly the clouds roll away. Donner and Froh
        become visible. A rainbow of dazzling radiance
        stretches from their feet across the valley to
        the castle, which is gleaming in the light of the
        setting sun._

FROH

        [_Who, with outstretched hand, indicates to the
        Gods that the bridge is the way across the valley._

  Lo, light, yet securely,
  Leads the bridge to your halls.
      Undaunted tread;
      Without danger the road!

        [_Wotan and the other Gods stand speechless, lost
        in contemplation of the glorious sight._

[Illustration: Plate 17
        "To my hammer's swing
        Hitherward sweep
        Vapours and fogs!
        Hovering mists!
    Donner, your lord, summons his hosts!"]

WOTAN

      Smiling at eve
      The sun's eye sparkles;
      The castle ablaze
  Gleams fair in its glow.
      In the light of morning
      Glittering proudly,
      It stood masterless,
  Stately, tempting its lord.
      From dawn until sundown
      No little toil
  And fear have gone to the winning!
      From envious night,
      That now draws nigh
  Shelter it offers us.

        [_Very firmly, as if struck by a great thought._

  So greet I my home,
  Safe from dismay and dread.

        [_He turns solemnly to Fricka._

      Follow me, wife!
  In Valhall sojourn with me.

FRICKA

      What means the name Valhall?
  I never seem to have heard it.

WOTAN

  That which, conquering fear,
      My fortitude brought
      Triumphant to birth--
  Let that explain the word!

        [_He takes Fricka's hand and walks slowly with her
        towards the bridge. Froh, Freia, and Donner follow._

LOGE [_Remaining in the foreground and looking
       after the Gods._

  They are hasting on to their end,
  They who dream they are strong and
           enduring.
      I almost blush
      To be of their number;
      A fancy allures me
      And wakes in me longing
  Flaming fire to become:
      To waste and burn them
      Who tamed me of old,
      Rather than perish,
      Blind with the blind--
      Yes, even if godlike the Gods were--
  More wise were it, perhaps!
      I must consider:
      The outcome who knows!

        [_With a show of carelessness he goes to the Gods._

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS [_From the valley. Invisible._

      Rhinegold!
      Rhinegold!
      Rhinegold pure!
      How radiant and clear
  Once thou didst shine on us!
      For thy lost glory
      We are grieving.
      Give us the gold!
      Give us the gold!
  O give us the Rhinegold again!

WOTAN

      What wailing sound do I hear?

        [_About to set his foot on the bridge, pauses and
        turns round._

LOGE [_Looks down into the valley._

      The Rhine's fair children,
  Bewailing their lost gold, weep.

WOTAN

      Accursèd nixies!
  Bid them tease us no more!

LOGE [_Calling down towards the valley._

      Ye in the water,
      Why wail ye to us?
  List to Wotan's decree.
      Ye have seen
      The last of the gold;
  In the Gods' increase of splendour
  Bask and sun yourselves now.


[Illustration: Plate 18
        "The Rhine's fair children,
    Bewailing their lost gold, weep"]

        [_The Gods laugh and cross the bridge during what
        follows._

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS

      Rhinegold!
      Rhinegold!
      Rhinegold pure!
      Oh, if in the waves
  There but shone still our treasure pure!
      Down in the deeps
      Can faith be found only:
      Mean and false
  Are all who revel above!

        [_As the Gods cross the bridge to the castle the
        curtain falls._

SCENES OF ACTION

    ACT I. THE INTERIOR OF HUNDING'S DWELLING
    ACT II. A WILD ROCKY MOUNTAIN
    ACT III. ON THE TOP OF A ROCKY MOUNTAIN
                       (BRÜNNHILDE'S ROCK)




THE FIRST ACT


_The interior of a dwelling-place built of wood, with the stem of
a mighty ash-tree as its centre; to the right, in the foreground,
is the hearth, and behind this the store-room. At the back is the
large entrance door; to the left, far back, steps lead up to an inner
chamber; on the same side, nearer the front, stands a table with a
broad bench behind it, fixed to the wall, and with stools in front. The
stage remains empty for a space. Outside a storm is just subsiding.
Siegmund opens the entrance door from without, and enters. With his
hand on the latch he surveys the room. He seems overwhelmed with
fatigue; his dress and appearance indicate that he is in flight. He
shuts the door behind him when he sees nobody, walks to the hearth with
the final effort of an utterly exhausted man, and throws himself down
on a bearskin rug._



SIEGMUND

      I rest on this hearth,
      Heedless who owns it.

        [_He sinks back and remains stretched out
        motionless. Sieglinde enters from the inner
        chamber; she thinks her husband has returned. Her
        grave look changes to one of surprise when she sees
        the stranger stretched out on the hearth._

SIEGLINDE [_Still at the back._

      A stranger here!
      He must be questioned.

        [_Coming nearer._

      What man came in
      And lies on the hearth?

        [_As Siegmund does not move, she draws nearer still
        and looks at him._

      Way-worn, weary
      He seems and spent.
      Faints he from weariness?
      Can he be sick?

[_She bends over him, and listens._

      He breathes still, his eyelids
      Are sealed but in slumber.
  Worthy, valiant his mien,
  Though so worn he rests.

SIEGMUND [_Suddenly raising his head._

      A drink! A drink!

SIEGLINDE

      I go to fetch it.

[_She takes a drinking-horn and hurries out.
She returns with it full, and offers it to
Siegmund._

      Lo, the water
      Thy thirsting lips longed for:
  Water brought at thy wish!

        [_Siegmund drinks, and hands her back the horn.
        As he signifies his thanks with a movement of the
        head, he gazes at her with growing interest._

SIEGMUND

      Welcome the water!
      Quenched is my thirst.
      My weary load
      Lighter it makes;
      New courage it gives;
      Mine eyes that slept
  Re-open glad on the world.
  Who soothes and comforts me so?

SIEGLINDE

      This house and this wife
      Belong to Hunding.
  Stay thou here as his guest;
  Tarry till he comes home.

SIEGMUND

      Shelter he surely
      Will grant a worn,
  Wounded, weaponless stranger.

SIEGLINDE [_With anxious haste._

Quick, show me! Where are thy wounds?

SIEGMUND

        [_Shakes himself and springs up briskly to a
        sitting posture._

      My wounds are slight,
      Scarce worthy remark;
      My limbs are well knit still,
      Whole and unharmed.
  If my spear and shield had but been
  Half so strong as my arm is,
  I had vanquished the foe;
  But in splinters were spear and shield.
      The horde of foemen
      Harassed me sore;
      Through storm and strife
      Spent was my force;
  But, faster than I from foemen,
  All my faintness has fled;
  Darkness fell deep on my lids,
  But now the sun again laughs.

SIEGLINDE

        [_Goes to the storeroom, fills a horn with
        mead, and proffers it to Siegmund with friendly
        eagerness._

      This healing and honeyed
      Draught of mead
  Deign to accept from me.

SIEGMUND

  Set it first to thy lips.

        [_Sieglinde sips from the horn and hands it back
        to him. Siegmund takes a long draught, regarding
        Sieglinde with increasing warmth. Still gazing,
        he takes the horn from his lips and lets it sink
        slowly, while his features express strong emotion.
        He sighs deeply, and lowers his gaze gloomily to
        the ground._

SIEGMUND [_In a trembling voice._

  Thou hast tended an ill-fated one!
      May all evil
      Be turned from thee!

        [_He starts up quickly, and goes towards the the
        back._

      I have been solaced
      By sweet repose:
  Onward now I must press.

SIEGLINDE

  Who pursues thee so close at thy heels?

        [_Turning round quickly._

SIEGMUND [_Stops._

      Bad luck pursues me,
      Everywhere follows;
      And where I linger
      Trouble still finds me:
  Be thou preserved from its touch!
  I must not gaze but go.

        [_He strides hastily to the door and lifts the
        latch._

SIEGLINDE [_Forgetting herself calls impetuously after him._

      Then tarry here!
  Misfortune thou canst not bring
  To those who abide with it!

[Illustration: Plate 19
    SIEGLINDE
        "This healing and honeyed
        Draught of mead
    Deign to accept from me."
    SIEGFRIED
    "Set it first to thy lips."]

SIEGMUND

        [_Deeply moved, remains standing; he looks
        searchingly at Sieglinde, who, ashamed and sad,
        lowers her eyes. Returning, he leans against the
        hearth, his gaze fixed on Sieglinde, who continues
        silently embarrassed._

  Wehwalt named I myself:
  Hunding here will I wait for.

        _Sieglinde starts, listens and hears Hunding
        outside leading his horse to the stable. She
        hurries to the door and opens it. Hunding, armed
        with shield and spear, enters, but, perceiving
        Siegmund, pauses on the threshold. Hunding turns
        with a look of stern inquiry to Sieglinde._

SIEGLINDE [_In answer to Hunding's look._

      On the hearth
      Fainting I found
  One whom need drove here.

HUNDING

      Hast succoured him?

SIEGLINDE

      I gave him, as a guest,
  Welcome and a drink.

SIEGMUND [_Regarding Hunding firmly and calmly._

      Drink she gave,
      Shelter too:
  Wouldst therefore chide the woman?

HUNDING

      Sacred is my hearth:
      Sacred hold thou my house.

        [_To Sieglinde, as he takes off his armour and
        hands it to her._

      Set the meal for us men!

        [_Sieglinde hangs up the arms on the stem of
        the ash-tree, fetches food and drink from
        the store-room and sets supper on the table.
        Involuntarily she turns her gaze on Siegmund
        again._

HUNDING

        [_Examining Siegmund's features keenly and with
        amaze, compares them with Sieglinde's. Aside._

       How like to the woman!
       In his eye as well
   Gleams the guile of the serpent.

        [_He conceals his surprise, and turns with apparent
        unconcern to Siegmund._

      Far, I trow,
      Must thou have fared;
      The man who rests here
      Rode no horse:
      What toilsome journey
      Made thee so tired?

SIEGMUND

      Through wood and meadow,
      Thicket and moor,
      Chased by the storm
      And peril sore,
  I ran by I know not what road.
      I know as little
      What goal it led to,
  And I would gladly be told.

HUNDING [_At table, inviting Siegmund to be seated._

      'Tis Hunding owns
      The roof and room
  Which have harboured thee.
      If to the westward
      Thou wert to wend,
      In homesteads rich
      Thou wouldst find kinsmen
  Who guard the honour of Hunding.
  May I ask of my guest
  In return to tell me his name?

        [_Siegmund, who has taken his seat at the table,
        looks thoughtfully before him. Sieglinde, who
        has placed herself beside Hunding and opposite
        Siegmund, gazes at him with evident sympathy and
        suspense._

[Illustration: Plate 20, Hunding discovers the likeness between Siegmund
and Sieglinde.]

HUNDING [_Watching them both._

      If thou wilt not
      Trust it to me,
  To this woman tell thy secret:
  See, how eagerly she asks!

SIEGLINDE [_Unembarrassed and interested._

     Gladly I'd know
     Who thou art.

SIEGMUND [_Looks up and, gazing into her eyes, begins gravely._

  Not for me the name Friedmund;
  Frohwalt fain were I called,
  But forced was I to be Wehwalt.
  Wölfe they called my father;
  And I am one of twins:
  With a sister twin I was born.
      Soon lost were
      Both mother and maid;
      I hardly knew
      Her who gave me my life,
  Nor her with whom I was born.
  Warlike and strong was Wölfe,
  And never wanting for foes.
      A-hunting oft
      Went the son with the father.
      One day we returned
      Outworn with the chase
  And found the wolf's nest robbed.
      The brave abode
      To ashes was burnt,
      Consumed to dust
      The flourishing oak,
      And dead was the mother,
      Dauntless but slain.
      No trace of the sister
      Was ever found:
  The Neidungs' heartless horde
  Had dealt us this bitter blow.
      My father fled,
      An outlaw with me;
      And the youth
      Lived wild in the forest
  With Wölfe for many years.
  Sore beset and harried were they,
  But boldly battled the pair of wolves.

        [_Turning to Hunding._

  A Wölfing tells thee the tale,
  And a well-known Wölfing, I trow.

HUNDING

  Wondrous and wild the story
  Told by thee, valiant guest:
  Wehwalt--the Wölfing!
  I think that dark rumours anent
  This doughty pair have reached me,
      Though unknown Wölfe
      And Wölfing too.

SIEGLINDE

  But tell me further, stranger:
  Where dwells thy father now?

SIEGMUND

  The Neidungs, starting anew,
  Hounded and hunted us down;
      But slain by the wolves
      Fell many a hunter;
      They fled through the wood,
      Chased by the game:
  Like chaff we scattered the foe.
  But trace of my father I lost;
      Still his trail grew fainter
      The longer I followed;
      In the wood a wolf-skin
      Was all I found;
  There empty it lay:
  My father I had lost.--
  In the woods I could not stay;
  My heart longed for men and for women.--
      By all I met,
      No matter where,
      If friend I sought,
      Or woman wooed,
  Still I was branded an outlaw;
  Ill-luck clung to me;
  Whatever I did right,
  Others counted it wrong;
  What seemed evil to me
  Won from others applause.
      Grim feuds arose
      Wherever I went;
      Wrath met me
      At every turn;
      Longing for gladness,
      Woe was my lot:
  I called myself Wehwalt therefore,
  For woe was all that was mine.

        [_He looks at Sieglinde and marks her sympathetic
        gaze._

HUNDING

  Thou wert shown no grace by the Norns
  That cast thy grievous lot;
  No one greets thee as guest
  With gladness in his home.

SIEGLINDE

  Only cowards would fear
  A weaponless, lonely man!--
      Tell us, O guest,
      How in the strife
  At last thy weapon was lost!

SIEGMUND

      A sorrowful child
      Cried for my help;
      Her kinsmen wanted
      To wed the maiden
  To one whom her heart did not choose.
      To her defence
      Gladly I hied;
      The heartless horde
      Met me in fight:
  Before me foemen fell.
  Fordone and dead lay the brothers.
  The slain were embraced by the maid,
  Her wrongs forgotten in grief.
  She wept wild streams of woe,
  And bathed the dead with her tears;
  For the loss of her brothers slain
  Lamented the ill-fated bride.
      Then the dead men's kinsmen
      Came like a storm,
      Vowing vengeance,
      Frantic to fall on me;
      Foemen on all sides
      Rose and assailed me.
      But from the spot
      Moved not the maid;
      My shield and spear
      Sheltered her long,
      Till spear and shield
      Were hewn from my hand.
  Standing weaponless, wounded,
  I beheld the maid die:
  I fled from the furious host--
  She lay lifeless on the dead.

        [_To Sieglinde with a look of fervent sorrow._

  The reason now I have told
  Why none may know me as Friedmund.

        [_He rises and walks to the hearth. Pale and deeply
        moved, Sieglinde looks on the ground._

HUNDING [_Rises._

  I know a wild-blooded breed;
      What others revere
      It flouts unawed:
  All hate it, and I with the rest.
      When forth in haste I was summoned,
      Vengeance to seek
      For my kinsmen's blood,
      I came too late,
      And now return home
  To find the impious wretch
  In haven under my roof.--
      My house holds thee,
      Wölfing, to-day;
  For the night thou art my guest.
      But wield to-morrow
      Thy trustiest weapon.
  I choose the day for the fight:
  Thy life shall pay for the dead.

        [_To Sieglinde, who steps between the two men with
        anxious gestures; harshly._

      Forth from the hall!
      Linger not here!
  Prepare my draught for the night,
  And wait until I come.

[_Sieglinde stands for a while undecided and thoughtful. Slowly
and with hesitating steps she goes towards the store-room,
There she pauses again, lost in thought, her face half averted.
With quiet resolution she opens the cupboard, fills a
drinking-horn, and shakes spices into it out of a box. She then turns
her eyes on Siegmund, in order to meet his gaze, which he
never removes from her. She perceives that Hunding is
watching, and proceeds immediately to the bed-chamber. On
the steps she turns once more, looks yearningly at Siegmund,
and indicates with her eyes, persistently and with speaking
plainness, a particular spot in the stem of the ash-tree.
Hunding starts, and drives her off with a violent gesture.
With a last look at Siegmund, she disappears into the
bed-chamber, and shuts the door behind her._

HUNDING [_Taking his weapons from the tree-stem._

  With weapons man should be armed.
  We meet tomorrow then Wölfing.
  My word thou hast heard;
  Ward thyself well!

        [_He goes into bed-chamber. The shooting of the
        bolt is heard from within._

        [_Siegmund alone. It has grown quite dark. All the
        light in the hall comes from a dull fire on the
        hearth. Siegmund sinks down on to a couch beside
        the fire and broods forsome time silently in great
        agitation._

SIEGMUND

  My father said when most wanted
  A sword I should find and wield.
      Swordless I entered
      My foeman's house,
      As a hostage here
      I remain.
      I saw a fair
      Woman and sweet,
      And bliss and dread
      Consume my heart.
  The woman for whom I long--
  She whose charm both wounds and
      delights--
  In thrall is held by the man
  Who mocks a weaponless foe.
      Wälse! Wälse!
      Where is thy sword?--
      The trusty sword
      To be swung in battle,
  When from my bosom should burst
  The fury that fills my heart?

        [_The fire collapses. From the flame which leaps up
        a bright light falls on the spot in the ash-tree's
        stem indicated by Sieglinde's look, and on which
        the hilt of a sword is now plainly visible._

[Illustration: Plate 21, Sieglinde prepares Hunding's draught for the night]

      What can that be
      That shines so bright?
      What a ray streams
      From the ash-tree's stem!
      My eyes that saw not
      See the bright flash;
  Gay as laughter it gleams.
      How the radiant light
      Illumes my heart!
      Is it the look
      That lingered behind,
      Yonder clinging,
      When forth from the hall
  The lovely woman went?

        [_From this point the fire gradually goes out._

      Darkly the shadows
      Covered my eyes,
      Till her shining glance
      Over me gleamed,
  Bringing me warmth and day.
      Gay and splendid
      The sun appeared,
      And blissfully circled
      With glory my head--
  Till by the hills it was hid.

        [_The fire flickers up faintly again._

  But once more, ere it set,
  Bright it shone upon me,
  And the ancient ash-tree's stem
  Was lit by its golden glow.
      The splendour passes,
      The light grows dim,
      Shadowy darkness
      Falls and enshrouds me;
  Deep in my bosom's fastness
  Glimmers still faintly the flame!

        [_The fire goes out altogether. Total darkness.
        The door of the bed-chamber opens noiselessly.
        Sieglinde comes out in a white garment and advances
        softly but quickly towards the hearth._

SIEGLINDE

      Art asleep?

SIEGMUND [_Joyfully surprised._

      Who steals this way?

SIEGLINDE [_With stealthy haste._

  'Tis I: listen to me!
  In sleep profound lies Hunding;
  The draught that I mixed him I drugged.
  Use to good purpose the night!

SIEGMUND [_Ardently interrupting._

  Thou here, all is well!

SIEGLINDE

  I have come to show thee a weapon;
  O couldst thou make it thine!
      I then might call thee
      First among heroes,
      For only by him
      Can it be won.
  O hearken: heed what I tell thee!
      Here Hunding's kinsmen
      Sat in the hall,
  Assembled to honour his wedding.
      He took as his wife,
      Against her will,
  One who was bartered by thieves.
      Sad I sat there
      Through their carousing.
  A stranger entered the hall,
  An old and grey-coated man.
  So slouched was his hat
  That one of his eyes was hidden;
      But the other flashed
      So that all feared it:
      Overwhelming
      Its menace they found;
      I alone
      Suffered, when looked on,
  Sweet pain, sad delight,
  Sorrow and solace in one.
      On me glancing,
      He scowled at the others,
  As he swung a sword in his hands.
      This sword he plunged
      In the ash-tree's stem,
  To the hilt driving it home.
  The weapon he gains in guerdon
  Who draws it from its place.
      Though sore they struggled,
      Not one of the heroes
  Could win the weapon for his;
      Coming, going,
      The guests essayed it,
  The strongest tugged at the steel;
  Not an inch it stirred in the stem;
  In silence yonder it cleaves.
  I knew then who he was
  That in sorrow greeted me.
      I know too
      Now for whom
  The sword was stuck in the tree.
      O might I to-day
      Find here the friend
      Brought from afar
      By a woman's woe!
      Then all I have suffered
      In sorrow untold,
      All scorn and all shame
      In anger endured--
      All would avenged be,
      Sweetly atoned for--
      Regained fully
      The good I had lost;
      For mine I should win
      All I had wept for,
  Could I but find the dear friend,
  And clasp him close in my arms!

SIEGFRIED [_Embracing Sieglinde with passionate ardour._

      Dear woman, that friend
      Holds thee at last,
  Both woman and sword are his.
      Here in my breast
      Burns hot the oath
  That welds us twain into one.
      For all that I sought
      I see now in thee,
      In thee all
      That once failed me I find.
      Thou wert despised,
      My portion was pain;
      I was an outlaw,
      Dishonoured wert thou;
      Sweet revenge beckons,
      Bids us be joyful;
      I laugh
      From sheer fulness of joy,
  Holding thee, love, in my arms thus,
  Feeling the beat of thy heart!

        [_The outer door swings open._

SIEGLINDE [_With a start of alarm tears herself away._

  Ha, who went? Who entered there?

        [_The door remains open. Outside a glorious spring
        night. The full moon shines in, throwing its bright
        light on the pair, so that they can suddenly see
        one another quite plainly._

SIEGMUND [_In soft ecstasy._

    No one went--
    But one has come:
    Laughing the spring
    Enters the hall!

        [_He draws Sieglinde with tender force on to the
        couch, so that she sits beside him. The moon shines
        more and more brightly._

      Winter storms have yielded
      To May's sweet moon,
      And mild and radiant
      Sparkles the spring.
      On balmy breezes
      Light and lovely,
      Weaving wonders,
      Soft she sways.
      Through field and forest
      She is breathing;
      Wide and open
      Laughs her eye;
  When blithe the birds are singing
      Sounds her voice;
      Fragrant odours
      She exhales;
  From her warm blood blossom flowers
      Welcome and joyous.
      Shoot and bud,
      They wax by her aid.
  With tender weapons armed,
      She conquers the world.
      Winter and storm yield
      To the strong attack.
  No wonder that, beaten boldly,
  At last the door should have opened,
      Which, stubborn and stiff,
  Was keeping her out.
      To find her sister
      Hither she came;
  By love has spring been allured;
      Within our bosoms
      Buried she lay;
  Now glad she laughs to the light.
      The bride who is sister
      Is freed by the brother;
      In ruin lies
      What held them apart.
      Loud rejoicing,
      They meet and greet;
  Lo! Love is mated with spring!

SIEGLINDE

      Thou art the spring
      That I used to pine for,
  When pinched by the winter frost;
      My heart hailed thee friend
      With bliss and with fear,
  When thy first glance fell on me sweetly
  All I had seen appeared strange;
  Friendless were my surroundings;
  I never seemed to have known
  Any one who came nigh.
      Thee, however,
      Straightway I knew,
      And I saw thou wert mine
      When I beheld thee:
      What I hid in my heart,
      All I am,
      Clear as the day
      Dawned to my sight
      Like tones to the ear
      Echoing back,
  When, upon my frosty desert,
  My eyes first beheld a friend.

        [_She hangs enraptured on his neck, and looks him
        close in the face._

SIEGMUND [_Transported._

      O rapture most blissful!
      Woman most blest!

SIEGLINDE [_Close to his eyes._

      O let me, closer
      And closer clinging,
      Discern more clearly
      The sacred light
      That from thine eyes
      And face shines forth,
  And so sweetly sways every sense!

SIEGMUND

      The May-moon's light
      Falls on thy face
      Framed by masses
      Of waving hair.
      What snared my heart
      'Tis easy to guess:
  My gaze on loveliness feasts.

SIEGLINDE [_Pushing the hair back from his brow,
        regards him with astonishment._

      How broad and open
      Is thy brow!
      Blue-branching the veins
      In thy temples entwine.
      I hardly can endure
      My burden of bliss.--
  Of something I am reminded:--
  The man I first saw to-day
  Already I have seen!

SIEGMUND

      A dream of love
      I too recall;
      I saw thee there
      And yearned for thee sore!

SIEGLINDE

      The stream has shown me
      My imaged face--
  Again I see it before me;
  As in the pool it arose
  It is reflected by thee.

SIEGMUND

      Thine is the face
      I hid in my heart.

SIEGLINDE [_Quickly averting her gaze._

      O hush! That voice!
      O let me listen!
      These tones as a child
      Surely I heard--
  But no! I heard the sound lately,
  When, calling in the wood,
  My voice re-echoing rang.

SIEGMUND

      To sweet and melodious
      Music I listen!

SIEGLINDE [_Gazing into his eyes again._

      And ere now thy glowing
      Eye have I seen:
      The old man whose glance
      Solaced my grief,
  When he greeted me had that eye--
      I knew him
      Because of his eye,
  And almost addressed him as father.

        [_After a pause._

  Art thou Wehwalt in truth?

SIEGMUND

      If dear to thee,
      Wehwalt no more;
  My sway is o'er bliss not sorrow!

SIEGLINDE

      And Friedmund does not
      Fit with thy fortunes.

SIEGMUND

      Choose thou the name
      Thou wouldst have me be known by:
  Thy choice will also be mine!

SIEGLINDE

  The name of thy father was Wölfe?

SIEGMUND

  A wolf to the fearful foxes!
      But he whose eye
      Shone with the brightness
  Which, fairest one, shines in thine own,
  Was named--Wälse of old.

SIEGLINDE [_Beside herself._

      Was Wälse thy father,
      And art thou a Wälsung?--
      Stuck was for thee
      His sword in the stem?--
      Then let my love call thee
      What it has found thee;
      Siegmund
      Shall be thy name.

SIEGMUND [_Springs up._

      Siegmund call me
      For Siegmund am I!
      Be witness this sword
      I grasp without shrinking!
      That I should find it
      In sorest need
      Wälse foretold.
      I grasp it now!
      Love the most pure
      In utmost need,
      Passionate love,
      Consuming desire
  Burning bright in my breast,
  Drive to deeds and death!
      Nothung! Nothung!
      That, sword, is thy name.
      Nothung! Nothung!
      Conquering steel!
      Show me thy sharp
      And sundering tooth:
  Come forth from thy scabbard to me!

        [_He draws the sword with a violent effort from the
        stem of the tree and shows it to the amazed and
        enraptured Sieglinde._

      Siegmund the Wälsung
      Thou dost see!
      As bride-gift
      He brings thee this sword;
      With this he frees
      The woman most blest;
      He bears thee
      From the house of his foe.
      Far from here
      Follow thou him:
      Forth to the laughing
      House of the spring;
  Thy shield be Nothung, the sword,
  When Siegmund is captive to love!

        [_He throws his arm round her so as to draw her
        forth with him._

SIEGLINDE [_Delirious with excitement, tears herself
away and stands before him._

      Art thou Siegmund
      Standing before me,
      Sieglinde am I
      Who longed for thee;
      Thy own twin-sister
  As well as the sword thou hast
        won!

        [_She throws herself on his breast._

SIEGMUND

      Bride and sister
      Be to thy brother--
  So Wälsungs shall flourish for aye!

        [_He draws her to him with fervent passion. The
        curtain falls quickly._





THE SECOND ACT


_A wild, mountainous spot. In the background a gorge rises from below to a
high ridge of rocks, from which the ground slopes down again towards
the front. Wotan, in full armour, carrying his spear. Before
him Brünnhilde as a Valkyrie, also fully armed._



WOTAN

      Go bridle thy steed,
      Valorous maid!
      Bitter strife
      Soon will break forth;
  Brünnhilde, storm to the fray
  And cause the Wälsung to win!
      Hunding choose for himself
      Where to bide:
  No place in Walhall has he.
      So up and to horse!
      Haste to the field!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Ascends the height on the right, shouting
and springing from rock to rock._

  Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
  Heiaha! Heiaha!
  Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
  Heiaha! Heiaha!
  Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
  Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha! Hojoho!

[Illustration: Plate 22
    "Siegmund the Walsung
    Thou dost see!
    As bride-gift
    He brings thee this sword"]

        [_She pauses on a high peak, looks down into the
        gorge and calls back to Wotan._

       I warn thee, Father,
       See to thyself;
       Stern the strife
       That is in store:
   Here comes Fricka, thy wife,
   Drawn hither in her car by her rams,
       Swinging the golden
       Scourge in her hand!
       The wretched beasts
       Are groaning with fear;
   And how the wheels rattle!
   Hot she hastes to the fray.
       Such strife as this
       No strife is for me,
       Though I love boldly waged
       Strife 'twixt men.
   The battle alone thou must brave;
   I go; thou art left in the lurch!
       Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
       Heiaha! Heiaha!
       Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
       Heiaha! Heiaha!
       Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
       Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
       Heiaha! Ha!

        [_She disappears behind the mountain peak at the
        side. Fricka, in a car drawn by a pair of rams, has
        driven up the gorge to the mountain ridge, where
        she suddenly stops, alights and strides angrily
        towards Wotan in the foreground._

WOTAN [_Aside, when he sees Fricka approaching._

      The usual storm!
      The usual strife!
  But I must act with firmness

FRICKA [_Moderating her pace as she approaches, and
confronting Wotan with dignity._

  All alone among the hills
  I seek thee, where thou dost hide
      Fearing the eyes
      Of thy wife,
  That help in need thou may'st promise.

WOTAN

      Let Fricka tell
      Her trouble in full.

FRICKA

  I have heard Hunding's cry,
  For vengeance calling on me;
      As wedlock's guardian
      I gave ear:
      My word passed
      To punish the deed
  Of this impious pair
  Who boldly wrought him the wrong.

WOTAN

      Have this pair then
      Done such harm,
  Whom spring united in love?
      'Twas love's sweet magic
      That lured them on;
  None pays for love's might to me.

FRICKA

  How dull and how deaf thou wouldst seem!
  As though thou wert not aware
      That it is wedlock's
      Holy oath
  Profaned so rudely I grieve for.

WOTAN

      Unholy
      Hold I the bond
  That binds unloving hearts;
      Nor must thou
      Imagine that I
      Will restrain by force
      What transcends thy power;
  For where bold natures are stirring
  I urge them frankly to strife.

[Illustration: Plate 23, Brünnhilde]

FRICKA

      Deeming thus laudable
      Wedlock's breach,
      Pray babble more nonsense
      And call it holy
  That shame should blossom forth
  From bond of a twin-born pair!
      I shudder at heart,
      My brain reels and whirls.
      Sister embraced
      As bride by the brother--
  Who has ever heard
  Of brother and sister as lovers?

WOTAN

      Thou hearest it now!
      Be taught by this
      That a thing may be
  Which has never befallen before.
      That those two are lovers
      Thou must admit;
  So take advice and be wise!
      Thy blessing surely
      Will bring to thee gladness,
  If thou wilt, laughing on love,
Bless Siegmund and Sieglinde's bond.

FRICKA [_With a burst of deep indignation._

      Then nothing to thee
      Are the gods everlasting
      Since the wild Wälsungs
      Won thee for father?
      I speak plainly--
      Is that thy thought?
      The holy and high
      Immortals are worthless;
      And all that once
      Was esteemed is thrown over;
      The bonds thou didst bind
      By thyself now are broken;
      Heaven's hold
      Is loosed with a laugh,
  That this twin-born pair, unimpeded,
  The fruit of thy lawless love,
  May in wantonness flourish and rule!
      But why wail over
      Wedlock and vows,
  Since by thee the first they are scorned!
      The faithful wife
      Betrayed at each turn,
      Lustfully longing
      Wander thy glances;
      Thine eyes scan
      Each hollow and height
  As thy fickle fancy allures thee,
  While grief is gnawing my heart.
      Heavy of soul
      I had to endure it,
      When to the fight
      With the graceless maidens
      Born out of wedlock,
      Forth thou hast fared;
  For, thy wife still holding in awe,
      Thou didst give her as maids
      The Valkyrie band
      To obedience bound,
  Even Brünnhilde, bride of thy Wish.
      But now that new names
      Afford thee new pleasure,
      And Wälse, wolfish, in
      Forests has wandered;
      Now that to bottomless
      Shame thou hast stooped,
      And a pair of mortals
      Hast vilely begotten--
  Now thy wife at the feet
  Of whelps of a wolf thou dost fling!
      Come finish thy work!
      Fill the cup full!
  Mock and trample now the betrayed one!

[Illustration: Plate 24, Fricka approaches in anger.]

WOTAN [_Quietly._

      Thou couldst not learn,
      Though I might teach thee;
  To thee there is nothing plain
  Till day has dawned on the deed,
      Wonted things
      Thou alone canst conceive,
  Whereas my spirit broods
  On things not yet brought forth.
      Listen, woman!
      Some one we need,
  A hero gods have not shielded,
  And who is not bound by their law.
      So alone
      Were he fit for the deed
  Which no god can accomplish,
  Yet which must be done for the gods.

FRICKA

      With sayings dark
      Thou fain wouldst deceive me!
      What deed by hero
      Could be accomplished
  That was beyond the strength of the gods,
  By whose grace alone he is strong?

WOTAN

      Then his own heart's courage
      Counts not at all?

FRICKA

  Who breathed their souls into men?
  Who opened their eyes, that they see?
      Behind thy shield
      Strong they appear;
      With thee to goad them,
      Upward they strive;
  Those men that thou praisest,
  'Tis thou who spurrest them on.
      With falsehoods fresh
      Thou wouldst fain delude me,
      With new devices
      Thou wouldst evade me;
      Thou shalt not shelter
      The Wälsung from me;
  He lives only through thee,
  And is bold through thee alone.

WOTAN [_With emotion._

      He grew unaided
      In grievous distress;
  My shield sheltered him not.

FRICKA

  Then shield him not to-day;
      Take back the sword
      That thou hast bestowed.

WOTAN

      The sword?

FRICKA

      Yes, the sword,
      The magic sword
      Sudden and strong
  That thou gavest to thy son.

WOTAN

      Nay, Siegmund won it
      Himself in his need.

        [_From here Wotan's whole attitude expresses an
        ever-deepening uneasiness and gloom._

WOTAN [_Continuing passionately._

      Both conquering sword
      And the need came from thee.
      Wouldst thou deceive me
      Who, day and night,
      At thy heels follow close?
      For him thou didst strike
      The sword in the stem;
      Thou didst promise him
      The peerless blade.
      Canst thou deny
      That thy cunning it was
  Which led him where it lay hid?

        [_Wotan makes a wrathful gesture. Fricka goes
        on more and more confidently as she sees the
        impression produced on him._

      The Gods
      Do not battle with bondsmen;
  The free but punish transgressors.
      Against thee, my peer,
      Have I waged war,
  But Siegmund is mine as my slave.

        [_Another violent gesture from Wotan, who then
        seems to succumb to the feeling of his own
        powerlessness._

      Shall thy eternal
      Consort obey one
      Who calls thee master
      And bows as thy slave?
      What! Shall I be
      Despised by the basest,
      To the lawless a spur,
      A scoff to the free?
  My husband cannot desire me,
  A goddess, to suffer such shame!

WOTAN [_Gloomily._

      What then wouldst thou?

FRICKA

      Shield not the Wälsung.

WOTAN [_In a muffled voice._

      His way let him go.

FRICKA

  Thou wilt grant him no aid,
  When to arms the avenger calls?

WOTAN

      I shield him no more.

FRICKA

      Seek not to trick me;
      Look in my eyes!
  The Valkyrie turn from him too.

WOTAN

      The Valkyrie free shall choose.

FRICKA

      Not so; she but acts
      To accomplish thy will;
  Give order that Siegmund die.

WOTAN [_After a violent internal struggle._

      Nay, slay him I cannot,
      He found my sword!

FRICKA

      Remove thou the magic,
      And shatter the blade:
  Swordless let him be found.

BRÜNNHILDE [_Is heard calling from the heights._

      Heiaha! Heiaha!
      Hojotoho!
      Heiaha! Heiaha!
  Heiohotojo! Hotojoha!

FRICKA

  Thy valorous maiden comes;
  Shouting, hither she rides.

WOTAN

  For Siegmund I called her to horse.

        [_Brünnhilde appears with her horse on the rocky
        path to the right. When she sees Fricka she stops
        abruptly and, during the following, slowly and
        silently leads her horse down the path. She then
        puts it in a cave._

FRICKA

      By her shield to-day
      Be guarded the honour
  Of thy eternal spouse!
      Derided by men,
      Shorn of our power,
  Perish and pass would the Gods
      If thy valiant maid
      Avenged not to-day
  My sacred and sovereign right.
  The Wälsung falls for my honour.
  Does Wotan now pledge me his oath?

WOTAN [_Throwing himself on to a rocky seat in terrible dejection._

      Take the oath!

        [_Fricka strides towards the back, where she meets
        Brünnhilde and halts for a moment before her._

FRICKA

      Warfather
      Waits for thee;
      He will instruct thee
  How the lot is decreed!

        [_She drives off quickly._

BRÜNNHILDE

        [_Comes forward anxious and wondering to Wotan,
        who leaning back on his rocky seat, is brooding
        gloomily._

      Ill closed
      The fight, I fear;
  Fricka laughs at the outcome!
      Father, what news
      Hast thou to tell me?
  Sad thou seemest and troubled!

WOTAN [_Dropping his arm helplessly and sinking his head on his breast._

      By self-forged fetters
      I am bound,
  I, least free of all living!

BRÜNNHILDE

      I know thee not thus:
      What gnaws at thy heart?

WOTAN

        [_His expression and gestures working up, from this
        point, to a fearful outburst._

      O sacrilege vile!
      O grievous affront!
      Gods' despair!
      Gods' despair!
      Infinite wrath!
      Woe without end!
  Most sorrowful I of all living!

BRÜNNHILDE

        [_Alarmed, throws her shield, spear and helmet from
        her and kneels with anxious affection at his feet._

      Father! Father!
      Tell me what ails thee?
  With dismay thou art filling thy child!
      Confide in me
      For I am true;
  See, Brünnhilde begs it!

        [_She lays her head and hands with tender anxiety
        on his knees and breast._

WOTAN

        [_Looks long in her eyes, then strokes her hair
        with involuntary tenderness. As if coming out of a
        deep reverie, he at last begins, very softly._

      What if, when uttered,
      Weaker it made
  The controlling might of my will?

BRÜNNHILDE [_Very softly._

  To Wotan's will thou speakest
  When thou speakest to me?
      What am I
      If I am not thy will?

[Illustration: Plate 25, Brünnhilde slowly and silently leads her horse down the
path to the cave.]

WOTAN [_Very softly._

  What never to any was spoken
  Shall be unspoken now and for ever.
      Myself I speak to,
      Speaking to thee.

        [_In a low, muffled voice._

      When young love grew
      A waning delight,
  'Twas power my spirit craved;
      By rash and wild
      Desires driven on,
  I won myself the world.
      Unknown to me
      Dishonest my acts were;
      Bargains I made
      Wherein hid mishap,
  Craftily lured on by Loge,
  Who straightway disappeared.
      Yet I could not leave
      Love altogether;
  When grown mighty still I desired it.
      The child of night,
      The craven Nibelung,
  Alberich, broke from its bond.
      All love he forswore,
      And procured by the curse
  The gleaming gold of the Rhine,
  And with it measureless might.
      The ring that he wrought
      I stole by my cunning,
      But I restored it not
      To the Rhine;
      It paid the price
      Of Walhall's towers:
  The home the giants had built me,
  From which I commanded the world.
      She who knows all
      That ever was,
      Erda, the holy,
      All-knowing Wala,
  Warned me touching the ring:
  Prophesied doom everlasting.
      Of this doom I was fain
      To hear further,
  But silent she vanished from sight.
  Then my gladness of heart was gone,
  The god's one desire was to know.
      To the womb of the earth
      Downward then I went:
      By love's sweet magic
      Vanquished the Wala,
  Troubled her wisdom proud,
  And compelled her tongue to speak.
  Tidings by her I was told;
  And with her I left a fair pledge:
  The world's wisest of women
  Bore me, Brünnhilde, thee.
      With eight sisters
      Fostered wert thou,
      That ye Valkyries
      Might avert the doom
      Which the Wala's
      Dread words foretold:
  The gods' ignominious ending.
      That foes might find us
      Strong for the strife,
  Heroes I got ye to gather.
      The beings who served us
      As slaves aforetime,
      The men whose courage
      Aforetime we curbed:
      Who through treacherous bonds
      And devious dealings
      Were bound to the gods
      In blindfold obedience--
      To kindle these men
      To strife was your duty,
      To drive them on
      To savage war,
  That hosts of dauntless heroes
  Might gather in Walhall's hall.

BRÜNNHILDE

  And well filled surely thy halls were;
  Many a one I have brought.
      We never were idle,
      So why shouldst thou fear?

[Illustration: Plate 26

      "Father! Father!
       Tell me what ails thee?
  With dismay thou art filling thy child!"]

WOTAN [_His voice muffled again._

      Another ill--
      Mark what I say--
  Was by the Wala foretold!
      Through Alberich's hosts
      Doom may befall us;
      A furious grudge
      Alberich bears me;
      But now that my heroes
      Make victory certain
  I defy the hosts of the night.
      Only if he won
      The ring again from me,
  Walhall were forfeit for ever.
      Used by him alone
      Who love forswore
      Could the runes of the ring
      Bring doom
      To the mighty gods,
      And shame without end.
      My heroes' valour
      He would pervert,
      Would stir to strife
      The bold ones themselves,
      And with their strength
      Wage war upon me.
  So, alarmed, I resolved
  To wrest the ring from the foeman.

        [_In a low voice._

      I once paid Fafner,
      One of the giants,
      With gold accurst
      For work achieved.
  Fafner guards now the hoard
  For which his own brother he slew.
  The ring I must needs recover
  With which his work I rewarded.
      But I cannot strike one
      By treaties protected;
      Vanquished by him
      My valour would fail.
      These are the bonds
      That bind my power;
  I, who by treaties am lord,
  To my treaties also am slave.
      But what I dare not
      One man may dare--
      A hero never
      Helped by my favour,
      To me unknown
      And granted no grace,
      Unaware,
      Bidden by none,
      Constrained thereto
      By his own distress--
      He could achieve
      What I must not do:
  The deed I never urged,
  Though it was all my desire.
      But, alas! how to find
      One to fight me, the god,
      For my good--
      Most friendly of foes!
      How fashion the free one
      By me unshielded,
      In his proud defiance
      Most precious to me?
      How get me the other
      Who, not through me,
      But of himself
      Will perform my will?
      O woe of the gods!
      Horrible shame!
      Soul-sick am I
      Of seeing myself
  In all I ever created.
  The other whom I so long for,
  That other I never find.
  The free by themselves must be fashioned,
  All that I fashion are slaves!

BRÜNNHILDE

      But the Wälsung, Siegmund,
      Works for himself.

WOTAN

      Wild I roamed
      In the woodland with him,
      Ever against the gods
      Goading him to rebel.

        [_Slowly and bitterly._

  Now, when the gods seek vengeance,
  Shield he has none but the sword
      Given to him
      By the grace of a god.
      Why did I try
      To trick myself vainly?
      How easily Fricka
      Found out the fraud!
      She read my inmost
      Heart to my shame.
  I must bend my will to her wishes.

BRÜNNHILDE

  Of victory wouldst Siegmund deprive?

WOTAN

  I have handled Alberich's ring,
  Loth to let the gold go.
      The curse that I fled
      Is following me:
  I must always lose what I love most,
  Slay what my heart holds dearest,
      Basely betray
      All those who trust.

        [_His gestures, at first those of terrible grief
        end by expressing despair._

      Pale then and pass
      Glory and pomp,
      Godhead's resplendent,
      Glittering shame!
      In ruins fall
      The fabric I built!
  Ended is my work;
  I wait but one thing more:
      The downfall--
      The downfall!

        [_He pauses thoughtfully._

      And for the downfall
      Schemes Alberich!
      Now I see
      The sense hidden
  In the strange, wild words of the Wala:
  "When the gloomy foe of love
  Gets a son in his wrath,
      The high gods' doom
      Shall be at hand!"
      Not long ago
      A rumour I heard
  That the dwarf had won a woman,
  By gold gaining her grace.
      A woman bears
      Hate's bitter fruit;
      The child of spite
      Grows in her womb;
      This marvel befell
      The man who loved not;
      But I, the loving wooer,
      Have never begotten the free.

        [_Rising in bitter wrath._

      Accept thou my blessing,
      Nibelung son!
      I leave to thee
      What I loathe with deep loathing:
  The hollow pomp of the gods.
  Consume it with envious greed!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Alarmed._

      O say! tell me
      What task is thy child's?

WOTAN [_Bitterly._

  Fight, faithful to Fricka;
  Wedlock and vows defend!
      What she desires
      Is also my choice,
  For what does my own will profit,
  Since it cannot fashion a free one?
      For Fricka's slaves
      Do battle henceforth!

BRÜNNHILDE

      Ah repent,
      And take back thy word!
      Thou lovest,
      And fain, I know,
  Wouldst have me shelter the Wälsung.

WOTAN

  Siegmund thou shalt vanquish,
  And fight so that Hunding prevails.
      Ward thyself well
      And doughtily do,
      Bring all thy boldness
      To bear on the field;
      A strong sword
      Swings Siegmund;
  Undismayed he will fight!

BRÜNNHILDE

      He whom thou still
      Hast taught me to love,
      He whose courage high
      To thy heart was so precious--
  I will shield him in spite of
  Thy wavering word!

WOTAN

      Ha, daring one!
      Floutest thou me?
  Who art thou--who but the choiceless,
  Blind slave of my will?
      I have sunk so low
      By showing my mind,
      That the creature made by me
      Holds me in scorn.
  Dost thou, child, know my wrath?
      If ever its awful
      Lightning struck thee
  Then quail wouldst thou indeed!
      Within my bosom
      Burns enough rage
      To lay waste
      In dread ruin a world
  That once wore nothing but smiles.
  Woe to him whom it strikes!
  Dear the price he would pay!
      So be advised,
      Call it not forth
  But carry out my commands.
      Cut down Siegmund!
  That is the Valkyrie's task.

        [_He storms away and disappears among the rocks to
        the left._

[Illustration: Plate 27, Brünnhilde stands for a long time dazed
and alarmed]

BRÜNNHILDE [_Stands for a long time dazed and alarmed._

      Warfather
      Oft have I seen
  Enraged, but never once like this!

        [_She stoops down sadly, takes up her armour and
        puts it on again._

      How heavy
      My armour feels!
      And it felt so light
      When gladly I fought!
      I fight afraid.
  Evil is my cause!

        [_She gazes thoughtfully before her._

      Woe! My Wälsung!
      With sorrow sore
  Must the faithful one falsely forsake thee!

        [She turns slowly towards the back.

       *       *       *       *       *

        [_On reaching the rocky pass, Brünnhilde, looking
        down into the gorge, perceives Siegmund and
        Sieglinde. She watches them for a moment, then
        turns into the cave where her horse is, so that she
        is completely hidden from the audience. Siegmund
        and Sieglinde appear on the pass, Sieglinde
        hurrying in front. Siegmund tries to stop her._

SIEGMUND

      Wait here and rest;
      Tarry a while!

SIEGLINDE

      Farther! Farther!

SIEGMUND [_Embraces her with tender force, straining her to him._

      No farther now!
  O linger, woman most sweet!
      From bliss when most blissful
      Breaking away,
      In headlong haste
      Far thou hast fled,
  So fleet that I lagged behind:
      Through wood and field,
      Over cliff and scaur,
      Voiceless, silent,
      Speeding along,
  Thy foot stopped for no call.

        [_Sieglinde stares wildly before her._

      Tarry a while!
      Say but a word,
  Ending this speechless dread!
      See, thy brother
      Holds thee, his bride:
  Siegmund's comrade art thou!

SIEGLINDE

        [_Gazes into his eyes with growing rapture, throws
        her arms passionately round his neck and remains so
        for some time. She then starts up in wild terror._

      Away! Away!
      Fly the profaned one!
      Unholy
      The clasp of her arm;
      In shame, dishonoured,
      This body died.
      Fling it from thee,
      Flee from the corpse!
  The winds scatter her dust--
  The foul one who loved one so fair!
  When in his loving embrace
  She rested in rapture pure,
  And all the love of the man
  Was hers who loved him alone--
      When on holiest height,
      When bliss was at sweetest,
      And sense and soul
      Were steeped in delight,
      Hatred and loathing
      Of hideous dishonour
      Shook the disgraced one,
      Filled her with fear--
  The thought she once had obeyed.
  Bridegroom unloving, unloved.
      Leave the accurst one,
      Far let her fly!
      An outcast she is,
      Bereft of grace!
      Ah, I must leave
      The purest of heroes;
      I cannot be thine,
      To sully thy glory:
  Scorn to bring on the brother,
  Shame to the rescuing friend!

SIEGMUND

  For the shame and dishonour,
  Pay the transgressor's blood!
      No farther, then, flying,
      Here let us wait him;
  Here--here I shall slay him:
      When Nothung's point
      Shall pierce his heart,
      All thy wrongs will be avenged!

SIEGLINDE [_Starts up and listens._

      Hark! The bugles!
      Dost thou not hear?
      All around,
      Angry and shrill,
      From wood and vale
      Clamour their calls.
      Hunding has wakened
      From slumber deep;
      Kinsmen and hounds
      He summons together;
      How the dogs howl,
      Urged on hotly,
  Loud-baying to heaven
  Of the vows and the wedlock profaned!

        [_Gazes before her as if gone crazed._

      Where art thou, Siegmund?
      Art thou still here,
      Fervently loved one,
      Beautiful brother?
      Let thine eyes like stars
  Shine again on me softly;
      Turn not away
  From the outcast woman's kiss!

        [_She throws herself sobbing on his breast, and
        presently starts up in terror again._

      Hark! O hark!
      That is Hunding's horn!
      With his hounds full force,
      In haste he comes.
      No sword helps
      When the dogs attack:--
      Throw it down, Siegmund!
      Siegmund, where art thou?
      Ha, there! I see thee now!
      Horrible sight!
      Eager-fanged
      Are the bloodhounds for flesh;
      Ah, what to them
      Is thy noble air!
      By the feet they seize thee
      With terrible teeth;
      Alas!
  Thou fallest with splintered sword:--
      The ash-tree sinks--
      The trunk is rent!
      Brother! My brother!
      Siegmund--ha!

        [_She falls fainting into his arms._

[Illustration: Plate 28, Brünnhilde with her horse, at the mouth of the cave.]

SIEGMUND

      Sister! Belovèd!

        [_He listens to her breathing, and, when convinced
        that she still lives, lets her slide down so that,
        as he himself sinks into a sitting posture, her
        head rests upon his knees. In this position both
        remain till the end of the following scene. A long
        silence, during which Siegmund bends over Sieglinde
        with tender concern, and presses a long kiss on her
        brow._

        [_Brünnhilde, leading her horse, comes out of the
        cave and walks slowly and solemnly towards the
        front. She pauses and watches Siegmund from a
        distance, then advances slowly again and stops when
        she gets nearer. In one hand she carries her shield
        and spear, the other rest on her horse's neck, and
        thus she gravely stands looking at Siegmund._

BRÜNNHILDE

      Siegmund!
      Look on me
      Whom thou
      Must follow soon!

SIEGMUND [_Looking up at her._

      Who art thou, say,
  That dost stand so fair and so stern?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Death-doomed are they
      Who look upon me;
      Who sees me
  Bids farewell to the light of life.
      On the battle-field only
      Heroes view me;
      He whom I greet
  Is chosen and must go.

SIEGMUND

        [_Looks into her eyes with a long steadfast and
        searching gaze, then bows his head in thought and
        finally turns resolutely to her again._

      When thou dost lead,
  Whither follows the hero?

BRÜNNHILDE

      I lead thee
      To Wotan;
      The lot he has cast:
  To Walhall must thou come.

SIEGMUND

      In Walhall's hall
      Wotan alone shall I find?

BRÜNNHILDE

      A glorious host
      Of heroes slain
      Will greet thee there
  With love holy and high.

SIEGMUND

      Say if in Walhall
  Sojourns my father, Wälse.

BRÜNNHILDE

      His father there
      Will the Wälsung find.

SIEGMUND [_Tenderly._

      Will any woman
      Welcome me there?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Wishmaidens
      Serve there serene:
      Wotan's daughter
  Wine will bring for thy cup.

SIEGMUND

      High art thou
      And holy of aspect,
      O Wotan's child:
  But one thing tell me, divine one!
      The sister and bride,
      Shall she follow the brother?
  Will Siegmund find Sieglinde there?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Air of earth
      Still she must breathe here;
  Siegmund will find no Sieglinde there!

SIEGMUND

        [_Bends tenderly over Sieglinde, kisses her softly
        on the brow, and turns again quietly to Brünnhilde._

      Then greet for me Walhall,
      Greet for me Wotan,
      Greet for me Wälse
      And all the heroes,
      Wishmaidens lovely
      Greet thou also,
  And tell them I will not come!

BRÜNNHILDE

      Nay, having looked
      On the Valkyrie's face,
  Thou must follow her forth!

SIEGMUND

      Where Sieglinde dwells
      In weal or woe,
  There will Siegmund dwell also;
      My face grew not pale
      When I beheld thee:
  Thou canst not force me to go!

BRÜNNHILDE

      Force thee can none
      While thou dost live;
  Fool, what will force thee is death
      Warning of death
      Is what I bring.

SIEGMUND

      What hero to-day
      Shall hew me down?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Hunding's hand in the fight.

SIEGMUND

      Use threats more baleful
      Than blows from Hunding!
      Lurkest thou here
      Longing for strife,
  Fix on him for thy prey.
  I think it is he who will fall!

BRÜNNHILDE

      Nay, Wälsung,
      Doubt not my word;
  Thine is the death decreed.

SIEGMUND

      Knowest this sword?
      Who gave the sword
      Gave triumph sure:
  With this sword I laugh at thy threats.

BRÜNNHILDE [_In a loud voice._

      He whose it was
      Now dooms thee to death,
  For the magic spell he withdraws!

SIEGMUND [_Vehemently._

      Hush! Alarm not
      The slumberer here!

        [_In an outburst of grief he bends tenderly over
        Sieglinde._

      Woe! Woe!
      Woman most sweet!
  Most sad and ill-starred of all true ones!
      Against thee rages
      The whole world in arms,
  And I who was all thy defence,
  For whom thou the world hast defied--
      To think I cannot
      Shield thee, but, beaten
  In battle, thy trust must betray!
      O shame on him
      Who bestowed the sword,
  And triumph now turns to scorn!
      If I must fall thus,
      I fare to no Walhall--
  Hella hold me for aye!

        [_He bends low over Sieglinde._

BRÜNNHILDE [_Moved._

      So little prizest thou
      Life everlasting?

        [_Slowly and with hesitation._

      All thy care
      Is thy helpless wife
      Who, sad and weary,
  Heavily hangs in thy arms?
  Precious only is she?

SIEGMUND [_Looking up at her bitterly._

      Though young and fair
      Thou shinest to me,
      In my heart I know thee
      Cruel and cold!
      Canst thou do nothing
      But mock me, begone,
  Malicious, merciless maid!
      Or if thou must gloat
      Upon my distress,
  Then gloat and feast thyself full!
      With my woe
      Solace thy envious soul:--
  But of Walhall's loveless raptures
  Nothing more let me hear!

BRÜNNHILDE

      I see the distress
      That is tearing thy heart;
      The doomed hero's holy
      Sorrow I feel.
  Siegmund, thy wife be my charge,
  Protected safely by me.

SIEGMUND

      No other than I
  While my wife is living shall guard her.
      If death be my lot
  I will slay the slumberer first!

BRÜNNHILDE [_With increasing emotion._

      Wälsung! Madman!
      Listen to me!
      Entrust her to me
      For the pledge's sake
  That she carries of thee and thy love!

SIEGMUND [_Drawing his sword._

      This sword
  That a true man received from a false--
      This sword
  That fails me when facing the foe;
  Worthless when turned on the foe,
  Will serve me when turned on the friend.

        [_He points the sword at Sieglinde._

      Two lives now
      Laugh to thee here:
      Take them, Nothung,
      Envious steel!
  Take them with one fell stroke!

BRÜNNHILDE [_With a passionate outburst of sympathy._

      Forbear, Walsung!
      Listen to me!
      Sieglinde spare thou,
  And Siegmund too shall be spared!
      'Tis thus decreed,
      Recast the lot is!
      Thou, Siegmund,
  Shalt be blest and prevail!

[_Horns are heard in the distance._

      Hark to the horn!
      Prepare for the fray;
      Trust to the sword
      And strike without fear:
  Thy sword shall prove strong
  Thee the Valkyrie faithfully shields!
      Farewell, Siegmund,
      Hero most blest!
  On the field again I shall find thee.

[_She rushes away and disappears with her horse down
a gorge on the right. Siegmund gazes after her
joyful and exultant. The stage has gradually grown
dark. Heavy storm-clouds have gathered in the
background, and hide the cliffs, gorge, and rocky pass
completely from view._

SIEGMUND [_Bending over Sieglinde, listens to her breathing._

      Charmèd slumber
      Softly soothes
  The dear one's pain and grief.
  When the Valkyrie came, perchance
  She brought her this blissful repose;
  Else would the grimly fought fight
  Have terrified one in such woe.
      Lifeless seems she,
      And yet she lives;
      The sad one by smiling
      Dreams is caressed.
      In slumber lie soft
      Till the fight is won
  And peace shall end thy pain!

[_He lays her gently on the rocky seat and
kisses her brow in farewell. Then, hearing
Hunding's horn sound, he starts up
with resolution._

      Thou who dost call,
      Arm for the fray;
      Thy dues in full
      Thou shalt have:

        [_He draws his sword._

  Nothung pays him his debt.

        [_He hastens to the back and, on reaching the pass,
        immediately disappears in a dark thunder-cloud,
        from which, the next instant, a flash of lightning
        breaks._

SIEGLINDE [_Begins to move uneasily in her dreams._

  Would but my father come back!
  With the boy he still roams in the wood.
      Mother! Mother!
      I am afraid--
      The strangers seem
      So harsh and unfriendly!
      Fumes that stifle--
      Dense and black smoke--
      Fierce are the flames,
      And closer they flare--
      On fire the house!
      O help us, brother!
      Siegmund! Siegmund!

        [_She starts up. Violent thunder and lightning._

      Siegmund! Ha!

        [_She stares about her in growing terror. Almost
        the whole of the stage is veiled by black
        thunder-clouds. Hunding's horn is heard close at
        hand._

HUNDING'S VOICE [_From the mountain pass in the background._

      Wehwalt! Wehwalt!
      Stand there and fight,
  Or with the hounds I will hold thee!

SIEGMUND'S VOICE [_From farther back in the gorge._

      Where hidest thou,
  That I have missed thee thus?
  Halt, that I may find thee!

SIEGLINDE [_Listening in terrible fear._

      Hunding--Siegmund--
      Could I but see them!

HUNDING

  Come hither, impious wooer!
  Here by Fricka be slain!

SIEGMUND [_Also from the pass now._

      Thou thinkest me weaponless,
      Coward, still.
      Threat not with women!
      Thyself now fight me,
  Lest Fricka fail thee at need!
      For see, from the tree
      That grows by thy hearth
  I drew undaunted the sword;
  Come and try the taste of its steel!

SIEGLINDE [_With all her strength._

      Hold your hands, ye men there!
      Strike me dead first!

        [_She rushes towards the pass, but is suddenly
        dazzled by a light which flashes forth from above
        the combatants to the right, and staggers aside as
        if blinded._

BRÜNNHILDE'S VOICE

      Strike him, Siegmund!
      Trust to the sword!

        [_Brünnhilde appears in the glare of light,
        floating above Siegmund, and protecting him with
        her shield. Just as Siegmund is aiming a deadly
        blow at Hunding a glowing red light breaks through
        the clouds from the left, in which Wotan appears,
        standing over Hunding and holding his spear across
        in front of Siegmund._

WOTAN'S VOICE

      Back! Back from the spear!
      In splinters the sword!

        [_Brünnhilde with her shield recoils in terror
        before Wotan; Siegmund's sword breaks in splinters
        on the outstretched spear. Hunding plunges his
        sword into the disarmed man's breast. Siegmund
        falls down dead, and Sieglinde, who has heard his
        death-sigh, sinks to the ground as if lifeless.
        With Siegmund's fall the lights on both sides
        disappear. Dense clouds shroud all but the
        foreground in darkness. Through these Brünnhilde is
        dimly seen turning in wild haste to Sieglinde._

BRÜNNHILDE

      To horse, that I may save thee!

        [_She lifts Sieglinde up quickly on to her horse,
        which is standing near the side ravine, and
        immediately disappears. Thereupon the clouds divide
        in the middle, so that Hunding, who has just drawn
        his sword out of Siegmund's breast, is distinctly
        seen. Wotan, surrounded by clouds, stands on a rock
        behind, leaning on his spear and gazing sorrowfully
        on Siegmund's body._

WOTAN [_To Hunding._

      Begone, slave!
      Kneel before Fricka;
  Tell her that Wotan's spear
  Has slain what mocked her might.
      Go! Go!

        [_Before the contemptuous wave of his hand Hunding
        falls dead to the ground. Suddenly breaking out in
        terrible anger._

      But Brünnhilde!
      Woe to the guilty one!
      Woe to her
      As soon as my horse
  Shall overtake her in flight!

        [_He vanishes with thunder and lightning. The
        curtain falls quickly._




THE THIRD ACT


On the top of a rocky mountain


_On the right the stage is bounded by a pine-wood. On the left is the entrance
to a cave, above which the rock rises to its highest point. At the
back the view is quite open. Rocks of varying heights form the edge
of the precipice. Clouds fly at intervals past the mountain peak
as if driven by storm. Gerhilde, Ortlinde, Waltraute, and
Schwertleite have taken up their position on the rocky peak above
the cave. They are in full armour._



GERHILDE

        [_On the highest point, calling towards the
        background, where a dense cloud is passing._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha! Heiaha!
      Helmwige! Here!
      Guide hither thy horse!

HELMWIGE'S VOICE [_At the back._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha!

        [_A flash of lightning comes from the cloud,
        showing a Valkyrie on horseback, on whose saddle
        hangs a slain warrior. The apparition, approaching
        the cliff, passes from left to right._

GERHILDE, WALTRAUTE AND SCHWERTLEITE [_Calling to her as she draws near._

      Heiaha! Heiaha!

        [_The cloud with the apparition vanishes to the
        right behind the wood._

ORTLINDE [_Calling into the wood._

      Thy stallion make fast
      By Ortlinde's mare;
      Gladly my grey
      Will graze by thy chestnut!

WALTRAUTE [_Calling towards the wood._

      Who hangs at thy saddle?

HELMWIGE [_Coming out of the wood._

      Sintolt the Hegeling!

SCHWERTLEITE

      Fasten thy chestnut
      Far from the grey then;
      Ortlinde's mare
      Carries Wittig, the Irming!

GERHILDE [_Descending a little towards the others._

      And Sintolt and Wittig
      Always were foemen!

ORTLINDE [_Springs up and runs to the wood._

      Heiaha! Heiaha!
  The horse is kicking my mare!

GERHILDE [_Laughing aloud with HELMWIGE and SCHWERTLEITE._

      The heroes' feud
      Makes foes of the horses!

HELMWIGE [_Calling back into the wood._

      Quiet, Brownie!
      Pick not a quarrel.

WALTRAUTE

        [_On the highest point, where listening towards
        the right she has taken Gerhilde's place as
        watcher, calling towards the right-hand side of the
        background._

      Hoioho! Hoioho!
      Siegrune, come!
      What keeps thee so long?

SIEGRUNE'S VOICE [_From the back on the right._

      Work to do.
      Are the others all there?

THE VALKYRIES

        [_In answer, their gestures, as well as a bright
        light behind the wood, showing that Siegrune has
        just arrived there._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha! Heiaha!

GRIMGERDE's AND ROSSWEISSE'S VOICES [_From the back on the left._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha!

WALTRAUTE [_Towards the left._

     Grimgerd' and Rossweisse!

GERHILDE

      Together they ride.

        [_In a cloud which passes across the stage from the
        left, and from which lightning flashes, Rossweisse
        and Grimgerde appear, also on horseback, each
        carrying a slain warrior on her saddle._

HELMWIGE, GERLINDE AND SIEGRUNE

      We greet you, valiant ones!
      Rossweiss' and Grimgerde!

        [_Have come out of the wood and wave their hands
        from the edge of the precipice to Rossweisse and
        Grimgerde, who disappear behind the wood._

ROSSWEISS' AND GRIMGERDE'S VOICES

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha!

ALL THE OTHER VALKYRIES

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha! Heiaha!

GERHILDE [_Calling into the wood._

      Your horses lead into
      The wood to rest!

ORTLINDE [_Also calling into the wood._

      Lead the mares far off
      One from the other,
      Until our heroes'
      Anger is laid!

HELMWIGE [_The others laughing._

      The grey has paid
      For the heroes' anger.

ROSSWEISSE AND GRIMGERDE [_Coming out of the wood._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!

THE VALKYRIES

      Be welcomed! Be welcomed!

SCHWERTLEITE

      Went ye twain on one quest?

GRIMGERDE

      No, singly we rode,
      And met but to-day.

ROSSWEISSE

      If we all are assembled
      Why linger longer?
  To Walhall let us away,
  Bringing to Wotan the slain.

HELMWIGE

      We are but eight;
      Wanting is one.

GERHILDE

      By the brown-eyed Wälsung
      Brünnhilde tarries.

WALTRAUTE

      Until she joins us
      Here we must wait;
      Warfather's greeting
      Grim were indeed
  If we returned without her!

SIEGRUNE [_On the look-out, calling towards the back._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      This way! This way!

        [_To the others._

      In hottest haste riding,
      Hither she comes.

THE VALKYRIES

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha!
      Brünnhilde, hei!

        [_They watch her with growing astonishment._

WALTRAUTE

      See, she leads woodward
      Her staggering horse.

GRIMGERDE

      From swift riding
      How Grane pants!

ROSSWEISSE

      No Valkyrie's flight
      Ever so fast was.

ORTLINDE

      What lies on her saddle?

HELMWIGE

      That is no man!

SIEGRUNE

      'Tis a woman, see!

GERHILDE

      Where found she the maid?

SCHWERTLEITE

      Has she no greeting
      For her sisters?

WALTRAUTE [_Calling down very loudly._

      Heiaha! Brünnhilde!
      Dost thou not hear?

ORTLINDE

      From her horse
      Let us help our sister.

        [_Helmwige and Gerhilde run to the wood, followed
        by Siegrune and Rossweisse._

      Hojotoho! Hojotoho!
      Heiaha!

WALTRAUTE

      To earth has sunk
      Grane the strong one!

GRIMGERDE

      From the saddle swift
      She snatches the maid.

THE OTHER VALKYRIES

      Sister! Sister!
      What has occurred?

        [_The Valkyries all return to the stage; Brünnhilde
        accompanies them, leading and supporting Sieglinde._

      Turns and looks
      out anxiously,
      then comes back.

BRÜNNHILDE [_Breathless._

      Shield me and help
      In dire distress!

THE VALKYRIES

      Whence rodest thou hither,
      Hasting so hard?
  Thus ride they only who flee.

BRÜNNHILDE

      I flee for the first time
      And am pursued:
  Warfather follows close.

THE VALKYRIES [_Terribly alarmed._

      Hast thou gone crazy?
      Speak to us! What?
      Pursued by Warfather?
      Flying from him?

BRÜNNHILDE

      O sisters, spy
      From the rocky peak!
      Look north and tell me
      If Warfather nears!

        [_Ortlinde and Waltraute spring up the peak to the
        look-out._

      Quick! Is he in sight?

ORTLINDE

      A storm from the north
      Is nearing.

WALTRAUTE

      Darkly the clouds
      Congregate there.

THE VALKYRIES

      Warfather, riding
      His sacred steed, comes!

BRÜNNHILDE

          The wrathful hunter,
          He rides from the north;
      He nears, he nears, in fury!
          Save this woman!
          Sisters your help!


[Illustration: Plate 29
BRÜNNHILDE
    "I flee for the first time
     And am pursued:
Warfather follows close.
  . . . . . . . . .
He nears, he nears, in fury
     Save this woman!
     Sisters, your help!"]

THE VALKYRIES

      What threatens the woman?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Hark to me quickly!
      Sieglinde this is,
  Siegmund's sister and bride.
      Wotan his fury
  Against the Wälsungs has turned.
      He told me
      That to-day I must fail
      The brother in strife;
      But with my shield
      I guarded him safe,
      Daring the God,
  Who slew him himself with his spear.
      Siegmund fell;
      But I fled,
      Bearing his bride.
      To protect her
      And from the stroke
      Of his wrath to hide,
  I hastened, O my sisters, to you!

THE VALKYRIES [_Full of fear._

      O foolish sister,
      How mad thy deed!
      Woe's me! Woe's me!
      Brünnhilde, lost one!
      Mocked, disobeyed
      By Brünnhilde
  Warfather's holy command!

WALTRAUTE [_On the look-out._

      Darkness comes
      From the north like the night.

ORTLINDE [_On the look-out._

      Hither steering,
      Rages the storm.

ROSSWEISSE, GRIMGERDE, and SCHWERTLEITE

      Wildly neighs
      Warfather's horse!

HELMWIGE, GERHILDE, and SIEGRUNE

      Panting, snorting it comes!

BRÜNNHILDE

      Woe to the woman
      If here she is found,
      For Wotan has vowed
      The Wälsungs shall perish!
      The horse that is swiftest
      Which of you lends,
  That forth the woman may fly?

SIEGRUNE

      Wouldst have us too
      Madly rebel?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Rossweisse, sister,
      Wilt lend me thy racer!

ROSSWEISSE

      The fleet one from Wotan
      Never yet fled.

BRÜNNHILDE

      Helmwige, hear me!

HELMWIGE

      I flout not our father.

BRÜNNHILDE

      Waltraute! Gerhilde!
      Give me your horse!
      Schwertleite! Siegrune!
      See my distress!
      Stand by me now
      Because of our love:
  Rescue this woman in woe!

SIEGLINDE

        [_Who until now has been staring gloomily and
        coldly before her, starts up with a repellent
        gesture as Brünnhilde encircles her with a warm,
        protective embrace._

  Concern thyself not about me;
  Death is all that I crave.
      From off the field
      Who bade thee thus bear me?
      For there perchance
      By the selfsame weapon
      That struck down Siegmund
      I too had died,
      Made one with him
      In the hour of death.
      Far from Siegmund--
      Siegmund, from thee!
      O cover me, Death,
      From the sorrow!
      Wouldst thou not have me
      Curse thee for flying?
  Thou must hearken, maid, to my prayer:
  Pierce thou my heart with thy sword!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Impressively._

      Live for the sake
      Of thy love, O woman!
      Rescue the pledge
      Thou has gotten from him:
  The Wälsung's child thou shalt bear!

SIEGLINDE

        [_Gives a violent start; suddenly her face beams
        with sublime joy._

      Save me, ye bold ones!
      Rescue my child!
      Shelter me, maidens,
      And strong be your shield!

        [_An ever-darkening thunderstorm nears from the
        back._

WALTRAUTE [_On the look-out._

      The storm has drawn nigh.

ORTLINDE

      Fly, all who fear it!

THE VALKYRIES

      Hence with the woman;
      Here she is lost:
      The Valkyries dare not
      Shield her from doom!

SIEGLINDE [_On her knees before Brünnhilde._

      Save me, O maid!
      Rescue the mother!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Raising Sieglinde with sudden resolve._

      Away then, and swiftly!
      Alone thou shalt fly.
  I--stay in thy stead,
  Victim of Wotan's anger.
      I will hold here
      The God in his wrath,
  Till I know thee past reach of his rage.

SIEGLINDE

  Say, whither shall my flight be?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Which of you, sisters,
      Eastward has journeyed?

SIEGRUNE

      A forest stretches
      Far in the east;
      The Nibelung's hoard
  By Fafner thither was borne.

SCHWERTLEITE

      There as a dread
      Dragon he sojourns,
      And in a cave
  Keeps watch over Alberich's ring.

GRIMGERDE

      'Tis uncanny there
      For a woman's home.

BRÜNNHILDE

  And yet from Wotan's wrath
  Shelter sure were the wood;
      For he both fears
      And keeps far from the place.

[Illustration: Plate 30
        "There as a dread
        Dragon he sojourns,
        And in a cave
    Keeps watch over Alberich's ring."]

WALTRAUTE [_On the look-out._

      Raging, Wotan
      Rides to the rock!

THE VALKYRIES

      Brünnhilde, hark!
      Like a storm-wind he comes!

BRÜNNHILDE

      Flee then swiftly,
      Thy face to the east!
      Boldly enduring,
      Defy every ill--
      Hunger and thirst,
      Briar and stone;
      Laugh, whether gnawed
      By anguish or want!
      For one thing know
      And hold to always--
  The world's most glorious hero
  Hideth, O woman, thy sheltering womb!

        [_She takes the pieces of Siegmund's sword from
        under her breast-plate and gives them to Sieglinde._

      The splintered sword's pieces
      Guard securely;
  From the field where slain was
      His father I brought them.
      And now I name
      Him who one day
      The sword new-welded shall swing--
  "Siegfried" rejoice and prevail!

SIEGLINDE [_Greatly moved._

      Sublimest wonder!
      Glorious maid!
      From thee high solace
      I have received!
      For him whom we loved
      I save the beloved one.
      May my thanks one day
      Sweet reward bring!
      Fare thou well!
  Be blest by Sieglind' in woe!

        [_She hastens away to the right in front. The
        rocky peak is surrounded by black thunder-clouds.
        A fearful storm rages from the back. A fiery glow
        increases in strength to the right._

WOTAN'S VOICE

Stay, Brünnhilde!

ORTLINDE AND WALTRAUTE [_Coming down from the look-out._

      The rock is reached
      By horse and rider!

        [_Brünnhilde, after following Sieglinde with her
        eyes for a while, goes towards the background,
        looks into the wood, and comes forward again
        fearfully._

THE VALKYRIES

      Woe, Woe! Brünnhilde!
      Vengeance he brings!

      Ah, sisters, help!
      My courage fails!
      His wrath will crush me
      Unless ye ward off its weight.

THE VALKYRIES

        [_Fly towards the rocky point in fear, drawing
        Brünnhilde with them._

      This way, then, lost one!
      Hide from his sight!
      Cling closely to us,
      And heed not his call!

        [_They hide Brünnhilde in their midst and look
        anxiously towards the wood, which is now lit up by
        a bright fiery glow, while in the background it has
        grown quite dark._

      Woe! Woe!
      Raging, Wotan
      Swings from his horse!
      Hither hastes
      His foot for revenge!

WOTAN

        [_Comes from the wood in a terrible state of wrath
        and excitement and goes towards the Valkyries on
        the height, looking angrily for Brünnhilde._

      Where is Brünnhilde?
      Where is the guilty one?
      Would ye defy me
      And hide the rebel?

THE VALKYRIES

  Fearful and loud thy rage is!
  By what misdeed have thy daughters
      Vexed and provoked thee
      To terrible wrath?

WOTAN

      Fools, would ye flout me?
      Have a care, rash ones!
      I know: Brünnhilde
      Fain ye would hide.
      Leave her, the lost one
      Cast off for ever,
      Even as she
      Cast off her worth!

THE VALKYRIES

  To us fled the pursued one,
  In her need praying for help,
      Dismayed and fearful,
      Dreading thy wrath.
      For our trembling sister
      Humbly we beg
  That thy first wild rage be calmed.

WOTAN

  Weak-hearted
  And womanish brood!
  Is this your valour,
  Given by me?
  For this have I reared you
  Bold for the fight,
  Made you relentless
  And hard of heart
  That ye wild ones might weep and whine
  When my wrath on a faithless one falls?
      Learn, wretched whimperers,
      What was the crime
      Of her for whom
      Ye are shedding those tears.
      No one but she
  Knew what most deeply I brooded;
      No one but she
  Pierced to the source of my being;
      Through her deeds
  All, I wished to be, came to birth.
      This sacred bond
      So completely she broke
      That she defied me,
      Opposing my will,
      Her master's command
      Openly mocked,
  And against me pointed the spear
  That she held from me alone.
      Hearest, Brünnhilde?
      Thou who didst hold
      Thy helm and spear,
      Grace and delight,
  Life and name as my gift!
  Hearing my voice thus accusing,
  Dost hide from me in terror,
  A coward who shirks her doom?

BRÜNNHILDE

        [_Steps out from the band of Valkyries, and humbly
        but with a firm step descends from the rocky peak
        until within a short distance from Wotan._

      Here I am, Father,
      Awaiting thy sentence!

WOTAN

  I--sentence thee not;
  Thou hast shaped thy doom for thyself.
      Through my will only
      Wert thou at all,
  Yet against my will thou hast worked;
      Thy part it was
      To fulfil my commands,
  Yet against me thou hast commanded;
      Wish-maid
      Thou wert to me,
  Yet thy wish has dared to cross mine;
      Shield-maid
      Thou wert to me,
  Yet against me raised was thy shield;
      Lot-chooser
      Thou wert to me:
  Against me the lot thou hast chosen;
      Hero-rouser
      Thou wert to me:
  Thou hast roused up heroes against me.
      What once thou wert
      Wotan has told thee:
      What thou art now,
      Demand of thyself!
  Wish-maid thou art no more;
  Valkyrie thou art no longer:--
      What now thou art
      For aye thou shalt be!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Greatly terrified._

      Thou dost cast me off?
      Ah, can it be so?

WOTAN

  No more shall I send thee from Walhall
      To seek upon fierce
      Fields for the slain;
      With heroes no more
      Shalt thou fill my hall:
  When the high Gods sit at banquet,
      No more shalt thou pour
      The wine in my horn;
      No more shall I kiss
      The mouth of my child.
      Among heaven's hosts
      Numbered no longer,
      Outcast art thou
      From the kinship of Gods;
  Our bond is broken in twain,
  And from my sight henceforth thou now
        art banned.

THE VALKYRIES

        [_Leave their places in the excitement, and come a
        little farther down the rocks._

      Woe's me! Woe!
      Sister! O sister!

BRÜNNHILDE

      All that thou gavest
      Thou dost recall?

WOTAN

  Conquering thee, one shall take all!
      For here on the rock
      Bound thou shalt be,
      Defenceless in sleep,
      Charmed and enchained;
  The man who chances this way
  And awakes her, shall master the maid.

THE VALKYRIES

        [_Come down from the height in great excitement,
        and in terrified groups surround Brünnhilde, who
        lies half kneeling before Wotan._

      O stay, Father!
      The sentence recall.
      Shall the maiden droop
      And be withered by man?
      O dread one, avert thou
      The crying disgrace:
  For as sisters share we her shame.

WOTAN

       Have ye not heard
       Wotan's decree?
       From out your band
   Shall your traitorous sister be banished,
       No more to ride
   Through the clouds her swift steed to the
         battle;
       Her maidenhood's flower
       Will fade away;
       Her grace and her favour
       Her husband's will be;
       Her husband will rule her
       And she will obey;
   Beside the hearth she will spin,
   To all mockers a mark for scorn.

[Illustration: Plate 31, The ride of the Valkyries.]

        [_Brünnhilde sinks with a cry to the ground.
        The Valkyries, horror-stricken, recoil from her
        violently._

      Fear ye her fate?
      Then fly from the lost one!
      Swiftly forsake
      And flee from her far!
      Let one but venture
      Near her to linger,
      Seek to befriend her,
      Defying my will--
  The fool shall share the same doom:
  I warn you, ye bold ones, well!
      Up and away!
      Hence, and return not!
  Get ye gone at a gallop,
  Trouble is rife else for you here!

THE VALKYRIES [_Separate with a wild cry and rush into the wood._

      Woe! Woe!

        [_Black clouds settle thickly on the cliff; a
        rushing sound is heard in the wood. From the
        clouds breaks a vivid flash of lightning, by which
        the Valkyries are seen packed closely together,
        and riding wildly away with loose bridles. The
        storm soon subsides; the thunder-clouds gradually
        disperse. In the following scene the weather
        becomes fine again and twilight falls, followed at
        the close by night._

        [_Wotan and Brünnhilde, who lies stretched at his
        feet, remain behind alone. A long solemn silence._

BRÜNNHILDE

        [_Begins to raise her head a little, and,
        commencing timidly, gains confidence as she
        proceeds._

      Was the offence
      So shameful and foul
  That to such shame the offender should be
        doomed?
      Was what I did
      So base and so vile
  That I must suffer abasement so low?
      Was the dishonour
      Truly so deep
  That it must rob me of honour for aye?

        [_She raises herself gradually to a kneeling
        posture._

      O speak, Father!
      In my eye looking,
      Calming thy rage,
      Taming thy wrath,
      Explain why so dark
      This deed of mine
  That in thy implacable anger
  It costs thee thy favourite child!

WOTAN [_His attitude unchanged, gravely and gloomily._

      Ask of thy deed,
  And that will show thee thy guilt!

BRÜNNHILDE

      I but fulfilled
      Wotan's command.

WOTAN

      By my command
  Didst thou fight for the Walsung?

BRÜNNHILDE

      Yea, lord of the lots,
      So ran thy decree.

WOTAN

      But I took back
  The order, changed the decree!

BRÜNNHILDE

      When Fricka had weaned
      Thy will from its purpose;
  In yielding what she desired
  Thou wert a foe to thyself.

WOTAN [_Softly and bitterly._

  I thought thou didst understand me,
  And punished thy conscious revolt;
      But coward and fool
      I seemed to thee!
  If I had not treason to punish
  Thou wouldst be unworthy my wrath.

BRÜNNHILDE

       I am not wise,
   But I knew well this one thing--
   That thy love was the Wälsung's;
       I knew that, by discord
       Drawn two ways,
   This one thing thou hadst forgotten.
       The other only
       Couldst thou discern--
       What so bitterly
       Wounded thy heart:
   That Siegmund might not be shielded.

WOTAN

      And yet thou didst dare
  To shield him, knowing 'twas so?

BRÜNNHILDE [_Beginning softly._

      Because I the one thing
      Had kept in my eye,
      While by twofold desire
      Divided wert thou,
  Blindly thy back on him turning!
      She who wards thy back
      From the foe in the field,
      She saw alone
      What thou sawest not:--
  Siegmund I beheld.
      Bringing him doom
      I approached;
      I looked in his eyes,
      Gave ear to his words.
      I perceived the hero's
      Bitter distress;
      Loud the lament
      Of the brave one resounded;
      Uttermost love's
      Most terrible pang,
      Saddest of hearts
      Defying all odds---
      With my ear I heard,
      My eye beheld
  That which stirred the heart in my breast
  With trouble holy and strange.
      Shamed, astonished,
      Shrinking I stood.
      Then all my thought
      Was how I could serve him;
      Triumph and death
      To share with Siegmund--
      That seemed, that only,
      The lot I could choose!
      Faithful to him
      Who taught my heart this love,
      And set me
      By the Wälsung's side as friend--
  Most faithful to him--
  Thy word I disobeyed.

WOTAN

      So thou hast done
  What I yearned so greatly to do--
      What a twofold fate
  Withheld from my desire!
      So easy seemed to thee
  Heart's delight in the winning,
      When burning woe
      In my heart flamed fierce,
      When terrible anguish
      Wrung my soul,
      When, to save the world
      That I loved, love's spring
  In my tortured heart I imprisoned?
      Against my own self
      When I turned, to my torment,
      From swooning pain
      Arose in a frenzy,
      When a wild longing
      Burning like fire
  The fearful design in me woke
  In the ruins of my own world
  My unending sorrow to bury,

        [_Somewhat freely._

      Thy heart was lapped
      In blissful delight.
      Trembling with rapture,
      Drunken with joy,
      Thy lips drank laughing
      The draught of love,
  While I drank of divine woe
  Mixed with wormwood and gall.

        [_Dryly and shortly._

      By thy lightsome heart
      Henceforth be guided:
  From me thou hast turned away!
      I must renounce thee;
      Together no more
  Shall we two whisper counsel;
      Apart our paths lie,
      Sundered for ever,
  And so long as life lasts
  I, the God, dare nevermore greet thee!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Simply._

      Unfit was the foolish
      Maid for thee,
      Who, dazed by thy counsel,
      Grasped not thy mind
      When, to her, one counsel
      Alone appeared plain--
  To love what was loved by thee.
      If I must forth
      Where I shall not find thee,
      If the fast-woven bond
      Must be loosed,
      And half thy being
      Far from thee banished--
  A half once thine and thine only,
  O God, forget not that!--
      Thy other self
      Thou wilt not dishonour,
      Dealing out shame
      That will shame thee too;
  Thine own honour were lowered,
  Were I a target for scorn!

WOTAN

      The lure of love
      Thou hast followed fain:
      Follow the man
      Who shall wield its might!

BRÜNNHILDE

  If I must go from Walhall,
  No more in thy work be a sharer,
      And if as my master
      A man I must serve,
      I braggart base
      Abandon me not!
      Not all unworthy
      Be he who wins!

WOTAN

  With Wotan no part hast thou--
  He cannot fashion thy fate.

BRÜNNHILDE

  By thee has been founded a race
  Too glorious to bring forth a coward
  One day must a matchless hero
  From Walsung lineage spring.

WOTAN

  Name not the Wälsungs to me!
      Renouncing thee,
      Them too I renounced;
  Through envy they came to naught.

BRÜNNHILDE

      She who turned from thee
      Rescued the race;

        [_With an air of secrecy._

      Sieglinde bears
      Fruit holy and high;
      In pain and woe
      Beyond woe known to woman
      She will bring forth
      What in fear she hides!

WOTAN

       No shelter for her
       Seek at my hand,
   Nor for fruit that she may bear.

BRÜNNHILDE

      The sword she has kept
      That thou gavest Siegmund.

WOTAN [_Violently._

  And that I splintered with my spear.
      Strive not, O maid,
      My spirit to trouble!
      Await thou the lot
      Cast and decreed;
  I cannot choose it or change!
      But now I must forth,
      Fare from thee far;
  Too long I stay by thy side.
      I must turn from thee,
      As thou didst from me;
      I must not even
      Know thy desire;
      Thy doom alone
  I must see fulfilled!

BRÜNNHILDE

      And what is the doom
      That I must suffer?

WOTAN

      In slumber fast
      Thou shalt be locked;
  Wife thou shalt be to the man
  Who finds and wakes thee from sleep!

BRÜNNHILDE [_Falls on her knees._

      If fettering sleep
      Fast must bind me,
      An easy prey
      To the basest coward,
  This one thing that in deep anguish
  I plead for thou must accord!
      O shield thou the sleeper
      With soul-daunting terrors,

        [_Firmly._

      That by a dauntless
      Hero alone
      Here on the rock
      I may be found!

WOTAN

      Too much thou askest--
      Too big a boon!

[Illustration: Plate 32
    WOTAN.
    "Appear, flickering fire,
     Encircle the rock with thy flame!
        Loge! Loge! Appear!"]

BRÜNNHILDE [_Clasping his knees._

  This one thing
  Grant me, O grant me!
      The child that is clasping
      Thy knees crush dead;
      Tread down thy dear one
      And shatter the maid;
      Let her body perish,
      Pierced by thy spear,
  But, cruel one, expose her not
  To this crying shame!

        [_With wild ecstasy._

      O cause a fire
      To burn at thy bidding,
      With flame fiercely flaring
      Girdle the rock,
      And may its tongue lick,
      And may its tooth eat
  The coward who, daring, rashly
  Approaches the terrible spot!

WOTAN

        [_Overcome and deeply stirred, turns quickly
        towards Brünnhilde, raises her from her knees and
        looks into her eyes with emotion._

      Farewell, thou valiant,
      Glorious child!
      Thou the most holy
      Pride of my heart,
  Farewell! Farewell! Farewell!

        [_Passionately._

      Must we be parted?
      Shall I never more
      Give thee love's greeting?
      Must thou no longer
      Gallop beside me,
  Nor bring me mead at banquet?
      If I must lose thee,
      Whom I have loved so,
  The laughing delight of my eyes,
      For thee there shall burn
      A bridal fire brighter
  Than ever yet burned for a bride!
      Fiercely the flames
      Shall flare round thy bed,
      Flames dreadful, devouring,
      Daunting all cowards;
      Let cravens flee
      From Brünnhilde's rock!
  One only shall set the bride free,
  One freer than I, the God!

        [_Moved and enraptured, Brünnhilde sinks on the
        breast of Wotan, who holds her in a long embrace;
        then she throws back her head again, and, still
        embracing him, gazes into his eyes with emotion and
        awe._

  Those eyes so lovely and bright
  That oft with smiles I caressed,
      Thy valour
      With a kiss rewarding
      When, sweetly lisped
      By thy childlike mouth,
  The praise of heroes I heard:
  Those eyes so radiant and fair
  That oft in storm on me shone,
      When hopeless yearning
      My heart was wasting,
      And when the joy
      Of the world I longed for,
  While fears thronged thick around me--
      Once more to-day
      Gladdening me,
      Let them take this kiss
      Of fond farewell!
      On happier mortal
      May they yet shine;
  On me, hapless immortal,
  Must they close, and for ever!

        [_He takes her head in both hands._

     'Tis thus that the God
      From thee turns:
  He kisses thy Godhead away!

[Illustration: Plate 33, As he moves slowly away, Wotan turns and looks
sorrowfully back at Brünnhilde.]

[_He kisses her long on the eyes, and with
        these closed she sinks back softly into his
        arms, unconscious. He carries her gently to a
        low mossy mound, and lays her there beneath the
        broad-spreading pine-tree which overshadows it.
        He gazes at her and closes her helmet; his eyes
        then rest on the form of the sleeper, which he
        completely covers with the great steel shield of
        the Valkyries. Having done so, he moves slowly
        away, turning to take one more sorrowful look. Then
        he strides with solemn resolve to the middle of the
        stage, and points his sword towards a large rock._

      Loge, hear!
      Hark to my word!
      I who found thee at first
      A fiery flame,
      And from whom thou didst vanish
      In wandering fire,
      I, who once bound,
      Bid thee break forth!
  Appear, flickering fire,
  Encircle the rock with thy flame!

        [_He strikes the rock three times with his spea
r during the following._

      Loge! Loge! Appear!

        [_A gleam of fire issues from the stone and
        gradually becomes a fiery glow; then flickering
        flames break forth. Soon wild, shooting flames
        surround Wotan, who, with his spear, directs the
        sea of fire to encircle the rock. It spreads
        towards the background, so that the mountain is
        surrounded by flame._

      Let none who fears
      The spear of Wotan
  Adventure across this fire!

        [_He stretches out his spear as a ban, looks
        sorrowfully back at Brünnhilde, then moves slowly
        away, turning his head for a farewell gaze. Finally
        he disappears through the fire. The curtain falls._
