  REGIMENTAL BADGE.--"The Harp and Crown." Motto: "_Pristinæ
  virtutis memores_."

  NICKNAME.--"The Cross Belts" (1768), from its privilege of
  wearing the sword-belt over the left shoulder, in recognition of
  services at Saragossa, where it took the belts of the Spanish
  Cavalry; of this fact, however, there is no official record; also
  "The Georges" (from its Colonel's name, 1740-51); also "The Dirty
  Eighth."

  NOTES.--Composed originally of loyal Protestants who had fought
  at the Boyne. It gained much distinction in Spain and Flanders;
  and received its title, crest, and motto in 1777 as special marks
  of Royal favour. It shared largely in the glory of Leswarree and

II.

THE ROYAL ARTILLERY.


The Royal Regiment of Artillery.

[Illustration: THE ROYAL ARMS.]

[Illustration: THE GUN AND MOTTOES.]


TITLES.

  16th century to 1716. The Train of Artillery.

  1716 (from). The Royal Regiment of Artillery: comprising (Mar. 1900).
      (1) Horse Artillery (27 Batteries).
      (2) Field Artillery (121 Batteries).
      (3) Mountain Artillery (10 Batteries).
      (4) Garrison Artillery (83 Batteries); with
      (5) Artillery Militia: also incorporated.
      (6) The Royal Malta Artillery.
      (7) The (late) Bengal Artillery.
      (8) The (late) Madras Artillery.
      (9) The (late) Bombay Artillery.


PRINCIPAL CAMPAIGNS, BATTLES, &c.

One arm or other of this branch of the Service has, obviously,
taken part in every campaign: a particularised list is therefore
unnecessary. The guns are the "Colours" of the Artillery, and as such
are entitled to all "parade honours." Formerly, regimental honours
appear to have been worn by certain companies. Amongst such were
"Niagara," "Leipsic," "Waterloo," and "The Dragon of China."

  UNIFORM.--Blue with Scarlet facings. Plume, White.

  REGIMENTAL BADGES.--The Royal Arms and Supporters, with a Cannon.
  The mottoes, "_Ubique_" (Everywhere) over, and "_Quo fas et glori
  ducunt_" ("Whither Right and Glory lead us") under the gun.

  NICKNAMES.--"The Gunners;" "The Four-wheeled Hussars" (of the
  Royal Horse Artillery).

  NOTES.--Trains of artillery seem first to have been raised in the
  time of Henry VIII.; and up to 1716 appear to have been disbanded
  after each campaign. In 1716 several companies received permanent
  corporate existence, since which the exigencies of modern warfare
  have led to an enormous increase in the number of batteries. But,
  from first to last the record of the Royal Artillery has been one
  of distinction, and it may fitly be said to share the honours of
  all other regiments. The Royal Irish Artillery were absorbed in
  1801, and the East India Company's Artillery in 1858.

CAMPAIGNS, BATTLES, &c.

Like the Artillery, this Corps has necessarily taken part in every
campaign. Its services have been pre-eminent from the first, and few
regiments, if any, can show a longer or more distinguished list of
honoured names. Amongst many others may be mentioned Jones, Burgoyne,
Pasley, Colby, Denison, Napier of Magdala, Simmons, Gordon of
Khartoum, Gerald Graham, Kitchener of Khartoum, Warren, and others.

  UNIFORM.--Scarlet and Black velvet facings (in 1717); Scarlet
  and Orange facings (1772-88); Dark Blue and Black facings

The Irish Guards.

[Illustration: THE HARP AND CROWN.]

[Illustration: THE STAR OF THE ORDER OF ST. PATRICK.]

By an Army Order (No. 77, April, 1900), "Her Majesty the Queen,
having deemed it desirable to commemorate the bravery shown by the
Irish regiments in the recent operations in South Africa, has been
graciously pleased to command that an Irish regiment of Foot Guards
be formed. This regiment will be designated 'The Irish Guards.'"

The details of the Uniform have not yet been fully settled; the Harp
and Crown appear on the buttons, and the Shamrock on the collar,
while the regimental badge is the Star of the Order of St. Patrick.

The Irish Guards commenced their public service as the guard of
honour at the reception by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, at Paddington,
of Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief, on the occasion of his
return from the field of operations in South Africa, 1899-190[?].

  UNIFORM.--Scarlet and Sea-Green facings (1661-1768; sea-green
  was the favourite colour of Queen Catherine; see also "Badges");
  Scarlet with Blue facings (from 1768).

  TERRITORIAL BADGES.--"The Paschal Lamb" (the crest of the house
  of Braganza) with the mottoes, "_Pristinæ virtutis memor_" and
  "_Vel exuviæ triumphant_." Also "The Royal Cypher within the
  Garter." Also "The Sphinx," for Egypt (1801).

  NICKNAMES.--"Kirke's Lambs" (during the Monmouth Rebellion,
  1683, under the Colonelcy of Piercy Kirke the reputation of the
  regiment was none of the best). "The Sleepy Queen's" (at Almeida,
  1810, they carelessly allowed General Brennier to escape). "The
  Governor's Regiment" (on its formation for service in Tangier).

  NOTES.--Tangier was part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza,
  the Queen of Charles II. "The Paschal Lamb" is the crest of the
  royal house of Braganza, and the facings (sea-green) on formation
  were also in honour of the Queen. For gallantry at Tongres it
  received its title in 1703; also possibly its _second_ motto
  ("Even the Remnant Triumph"), a most desperate resistance of
  twenty-eight hours' duration having there been offered to the
  French attack. The other motto ("Mindful of Ancient Valour") is
  thought to refer to Marlborough's Spanish campaigns, in which
  it saw much service, besides having been specially selected for
  reinforcements.

  have rallied after dispersal at the hands of the Polish Lancers).
  "The Old Buffs" (to distinguish it from the 31st, the "Young
  Buffs").

  NOTES.--The Regiment of Buffs possesses the privilege of marching
  unhindered through the City of London with drums beating--a relic
  of Elizabethan days. At Punniar it captured eleven guns and a
  standard.

  Tangier. It became a "Royal" regiment in recognition of its
  devotion to William III. From 1704 to 1710 it served as a Marine
  corps. The present 2nd Battalion was formed in 1858.

  Wilhelmstahl (1762) it was granted the privilege of wearing
  Fusilier caps; also a white plume for gallantry at St. Lucia,
  and when it took the feathers from the caps of their French
  opponents. The 5th is now the only regiment retaining the
  distinction by a red and white hackle. At Wilhelmstahl Phœbe
  Hassell, the notorious "female soldier," served in the ranks.
  Its investment of Ciudad Rodrigo was specially commended by
  Lord Wellington. The territorial title was bestowed in 1782 in
  compliment to its Colonel, Earl Percy.

  distinguished--it was cut up at Almanza in 1707--and the Iron
  Duke characterised its performance at Eschalar (Pyrenees, 1813)
  as "the most gallant and finest thing I have ever witnessed."
  Also at Niagara it won special distinction, since when its
  general Colonial service has been unique.

  Lord Galway, a most arduous, hazardous, and difficult service.

  of Britannia on their breastplates."--General BAINBRIDGE, _in
  1848, when presenting new Colours_.

  NICKNAMES.--"The Old Braggs" (from its Colonel's name, 1734-51).
  Also "The Slashers" (the current stories to account for this
  sobriquet are mythical). "The Whitewashes" (of the 61st). "The
  Right-abouts."

  NOTES.--At Almanza the old 28th was all but cut to pieces: at
  Waterloo it captured a flag of the 25th French Infantry. The old
  61st was formerly the 2nd Batt. of The 3rd Buffs, and so retained
  its Buff facings.

  its ranks.

  NOTES.--On its way to Bengal in 1824, part of the old 31st was on

  colour at Ferozeshah, another at Aliwal, and two more at Sobraon.

  "A Turreted Archway," and "Two Feathers" (red). [The "Turreted
  Archway" commemorates the defence of "Lucknow;" and the "Two Red
  Feathers" is a distinction of the 46th, a Light company of which,
  in 1777, with others were brigaded as "The Light Battalion." The
  Americans were so harassed by the Brigade that they vowed "No
  Quarter." In derision, to prevent mistakes, The Light Battalion
  dyed their feathers red: the 46th Foot alone has retained the
  distinction.]

  NICKNAMES, &C.--These pertain to the late 46th: "Murray's
  Bucks" (from Colonel's name [1743-64] and its smart appearance
  on home duty in Scottish Royal livery). "The Surprisers" (from
  an incident [1777] in the American War). "The Lacedemonians"
  (its Colonel once, when under heavy fire, made a disciplinarian
  speech concerning the Lacedemonians). Also, in early days,
  "The Edinburgh Regiment." "The Red Feathers." "The Docs" (the
  initials).

  UNIFORM.--1st Batt., 1725 to 1739, the Highland dress with the
  tartans of the respective captains; 1739 to 1758, Red with Buff
  facings and "the 42nd tartan"; 1758 to present time, Red with
  Dark Blue facings. 2nd Batt., as the 42nd, and also as the
  73rd, the Highland garb and "42nd tartan" were long in wear.
  Subsequently (_circa_ 1786) Scarlet, with Dark Green facings, was
  adopted.

  REGIMENTAL BADGES.--"The Royal Cypher within the Garter." The
  badge and motto of the Order of the Thistle. Also (in each of the
  four corners) the Royal Cypher ensigned with the Imperial Crown.
  Also "The Sphinx" (for Egypt, 1801).

  NOTES.--The 1st Battalion of this famous corps, the oldest
  Highland regiment in the British army, was raised (_circa_
  1725-29) from six Independent companies of Highlanders. Its
  sombre dress of black, blue, and green tartan gave rise to its
  popular name. To enumerate its services is simply to narrate the
  military history of Great Britain since the early part of the
  last century. Hardly a campaign has been conducted, or a battle
  fought, in which the Black Watch--one battalion or the other,
  or both in company--has not participated; always with bravery,
  and frequently with conspicuous gallantry. Thereto its record
  of services abundantly testifies. At Fontenoy, Ticonderoga, and
  at Bushy Run "extraordinary" and "unexampled" gallantry was
  shown. It received Royal distinction in its change of title in
  1758, and was privileged to wear the red heckle in the bonnet,
  in recognition of its conduct at the battle of Guildermalsen in
  1795. In Egypt (in 1801, for which it bears "The Sphinx"), before
  Alexandria, it captured the Standard of the French Invincible
  Legion. Since then it has heaped fame on fame, and added "honour"
  to "honour" to its Colours. Nor has the 2nd Battalion (raised
  in Perthshire in 1758 as the 2nd Battalion of the 42nd, but,
  renumbered, long known as the 73rd prior to the territorial
  restoration of the ancient status) failed to win fresh laurels
  as occasion arose. At Mangalore (1783) against Tippoo Sahib,
  and side by side with the senior battalion at Waterloo, in
  the Netherlands, in the Indian Mutiny, and in the Kaffir wars
  of 1846-53, it has worthily sustained the undying fame of the
  regiment. Recent events in South Africa show that neither the
  officers nor the men of to-day have lost one iota of that
  traditional dash, determination, and bravery which have won for
  the Black Watch so glorious a place in British military annals.

  NICKNAMES.--"The Die-Hards," for stubborn valour at Albuera,
  by which the 57th practically insured victory; at the finish
  the Colours were riddled by thirty bullets, and the survivors
  numbered one officer in twenty-four, and 168 men out of 584.
  Colonel Inglis rallied his men again and again by "Die hard,
  my men, die hard!" The 57th had previously been known as "The
  Steelbacks," from the frequency with which its men, largely
  recruited by militiamen from London, were flogged. "The Pothooks"
  (the 77th), from the two sevens in its number.

  NOTES.--The 77th at El-Bodon was specially commended by Lord
  Wellington for "steadiness, discipline and confidence" when
  largely outnumbered.

  American War in 1777).

  NOTES.--For its defence, in 1760, against the French, of the
  Castle of Carrickfergus it at one time wore a "splash" on the
  buttons. After the ammunition was expended bricks and stones
  were thrown, and, so the story runs, their buttons were used as
  bullets. The 99th were raised in Lanarkshire--hence its former
  county title.

  UNIFORM.--1st Batt., Scarlet, Buff facings, and the Mackenzie
  tartan, with chako instead of feather bonnet (from 1777). 2nd
  Batt., Scarlet and grass Green facings (from 1758 till 1881).

  REGIMENTAL BADGES.--That in the _Army List_ is "The Elephant"
  with "Assaye"; but on the chako-plate and collar a special design
  is worn, combining "The Star of the Order of the Thistle" with
  "The Crown" as on the collar of the Order of the Star of India
  (for distinction gained by each battalion in India); a Horn on
  the Star with monogram H.L.I, surmounting a scroll with "Assaye"
  and "The Elephant" (without howdah or trappings) below.

  NICKNAME.--"The Pig and Whistle Light Infantry."

  NOTES.--The two veteran regiments now known as the 1st and 2nd
  Highland Light Infantry possess the longest "honour" record
  (twenty-nine in all) of any British regiment whatsoever, save
  the King's Royal Rifle Corps, which have thirty-two all told.
  The roll commences with "Carnatic," won by the 1st Batt. in the
  Hyder Ali campaign, seconded by the laurels of the 2nd Batt.
  at the Siege of Seringapatam, in which on several occasions it
  particularly distinguished itself. The same battalion contributed
  "Assaye" (with "The Elephant"). It is recorded that in this
  battle "Every officer present, save one, was killed or wounded,
  and the battalion reduced to a mere wreck." "Assaye" is an honour
  shared only with The Seaforths and The 19th Hussars. For its
  services in India the Honourable East India Company presented it
  (1803) with a complimentary Colour. Henceforward honours fell
  thick and fast on both battalions--at the Cape, particularly
  so throughout the Peninsula campaign, in the Kaffir wars of
  1851-53 (a large draft of its men went down in the ill-fated
  _Birkenhead_), at the Crimea, in the Indian Mutiny, and more
  latterly in the Egyptian campaigns of the eighties.

  UNIFORM.--1st Batt., Scarlet with Buff facings, and the
  "Mackenzie" tartan (from 1778, but in 1823 the tartan was changed
  to "Stuart," as directed by the Commander-in-Chief, Duke of York
  and Albany; subsequently the "Mackenzie" tartan was revived).
  The hackle is white. 2nd Batt., Scarlet with Buff facings and
  the "Mackenzie" tartan; from date of "linking" the facings have
  matched those of the 1st Batt.

  REGIMENTAL BADGES, MOTTOES, &C.--The Coronet and Cypher of
  the late Duke of York (who was also Duke of Albany); also,
  subsequently, the Cypher of the late Prince Leopold, Duke of
  Albany; also a Stag's Head (the cognisance of the Earls of
  Seaforth); also an Elephant (without howdah and trappings) with
  "Assaye" on scroll underneath; also a Thistle bearing the Star
  of the Order of the Thistle, with circle superimposed, within
  which is the Cypher (F) of the late Duke of York, surmounted by
  the Ducal Coronet. _Mottoes._--(1) _Cuidich'n Righ_ (Help, to the
  King): this, with the Stag's Head, appertains to the Mackenzies,
  and, according to tradition, was bestowed through the founder of
  the clan having saved the life of King Alexander II. of Scotland
  when attacked by a wounded stag. Borne by the Ross-shire Buffs
  from the first: officially recognised in 1825. (2) _Caber Feidh_
  (The Antlers of the Deer), the Seaforth slogan; and (3) _Tulloch
  ard_ (The High Hill), the old gathering-ground of the Mackenzies
  on Loch Duich in Ross-shire.

  NICKNAMES.--(1) "The Regiment of the Macraes" (from the large
  proportion of men of this name in the 72nd when raised); also
  (2) "The Wild Macraes" (when in Edinburgh their doings seriously
  frightened the inhabitants); (3) "The King's Men" (from the
  ancient motto of the 78th, "Help, to the King").

  NOTES, &C.--Both Batts. are successors of the old 78th (Highland)
  Regiment of Foot--Fraser's Highlanders--which saw much service
  under General Wolfe; disbanded in 1763. The second 78th was
  raised in 1778 by Kenneth Mackenzie, Earl of Seaforth, was
  renumbered as the 72nd in 1786, and is the direct ancestor of the
  present 1st Seaforth Highlanders. Seven years later the present
  2nd Seaforth Highlanders were raised as The 78th (Highland)
  Regiment of Foot, being also known, shortly afterwards, as the
  Ross-shire Buffs. The combined battle-roll of honour is much the
  same as that of the Black Watch and the Argyll and Sutherland
  Highlanders. "Assaye" (in 1803) was specially recognised by the
  Honourable East India Company presenting honorary colours to the
  late 78th (2nd Batt.). Half a century later, during the Mutiny,
  it rendered unparalleled service under Havelock, Outram, and
  Clive, adding "Lucknow" to the Colours, while its achievements in
  "Central India," "Afghanistan," "Kabul," "Kandahar," "Egypt," and
  "Tel-el-Kebir" are well within living memory.

  UNIFORM.--Red, with deep Yellow facings, and the Gordon tartan
  bearing a yellow distinguishing stripe (the Marquis of Huntly,
  who raised the late 92nd, 2nd Batt., became the fifth Duke of
  Gordon). The hackle is white.

  REGIMENTAL BADGES, &C.--"The Sphinx" (for Egypt), and "The Royal
  Tiger" (for India). In the device on buttons and waist-plate
  these are shown in the upper and lower divisions of the St.
  Andrew Cross, with "Egypt" and "India" underneath, respectively;
  also within a scroll, inscribed "Gordon Highlanders," on the
  centre of the cross, and resting on a thistle wreath, is worn
  the crest (a stag's head issuing from the ducal coronet) of the
  Marquis of Huntly.

  NICKNAME.--"The Gay Gordons."

  NOTES, &C.--Both regiments were raised in Scotland, the 75th
  specially for service in India at the instance and cost of the
  late Honourable East India Company, receiving on its return
  "The Royal Tiger" in recognition of nineteen years of eventful
  and arduous service. Fifty years later it again fought in
  India through the Mutiny. During this period the 2nd Batt., as
  the late 92nd, was distinguishing itself in Holland, in Egypt
  (with special distinction at Mandora), and particularly in the
  Peninsula Campaigns of 1809-14, no less than seven "honours"
  falling to its share. Fresh laurels were won at Quatre Bras in
  company with the Black Watch and the Royal Scots. Of its later
  exploits only the barest mention can be made--of its services
  in the Indian Mutiny, in Afghanistan (1878-80), including Kabul
  and the march to Kandahar and the rest--the emblazonments on the
  "Colours" tell a sufficiently emphatic story.

      had been retained longer than four years.
  1809-21. The 91st Regiment of Foot; its distinctive title was

      was for a time discarded, because of its supposed impediment

  Sutherland tartan.

  REGIMENTAL BADGES, &C.--"The Princess Louise's Cypher and
  Coronet," "The Boar's Head" (the Campbell crest), and "_Ne
  obliviscaris_." Also "A Cat" and "_Sans peur_" (the Sutherland
  cognisance).

  NICKNAME.--"The Rory's."

  NOTES.--The old 91st was raised at Stirling by the Duke of
  Argyll: hence its title, crest, and motto. The Cape was the
  scene of its first campaign, since which it, with its companion
  battalion, has seen much service--a forty-one years' combined
  record--in South Africa. Its "honours" were, however, chiefly
  won in the Peninsular campaigns at the beginning of the century.
  The 2nd Batt. was also raised in Scotland from the Sutherland
  Fencible Highlanders, and has had a most distinguished career
  from then till now. Little need to dwell on its prowess. Who
  amongst us does not remember, or who has not read of that "thin
  red line" drawn up by Colin Campbell to resist the onslaught of
  the Russian Horse at Balaclava; how the 93rd stood their ground,
  successfully stemming and finally repulsing that memorable
  charge; how it alone of all regiments of foot enjoys the proud
  distinction of "Balaclava" on its "colours"? And surely there is
  still less need to tell how a few months later, in the Mutiny,
  and especially at Lucknow, this famous corps added new and
  undying laurels to its regimental record--a record which is in
  the memory or ken of all.

  TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE

  Italic text is denoted by _underscores_.

  Bold text is denoted by =equal signs=.

  There are five occurrences of a regimental badge identity portrayed as
  a large-text fraction without a -- under the 'numerator'. These have
  been modified in the etext to V/D.G. 7/DG 4/H XX/H and XXI/H.

  The two footnotes in the text have been placed at the end of the
  section where the reference (anchor) is.

  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
  the text and consultation of external sources.

  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,
  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained. For example,
  re-named, renamed; body-guard, bodyguard; Neer Landen, Neer-Landen;
  Belle Isle, Belle-Isle.

  Pg 162, '1741-51. Colonel James Long' replaced by '1749-51...'.
  Pg 197, 'no less that seven' replaced by 'no less than seven'.
  Pg 203, 'The 89th ... London: Parker. 1842.' The year 1842 is clearly
  incorrect, but has been retained since the correct year is unknown.
