                                FOREWORD


Since we talk in phrases as well as in words every home needs a phrase
book as well as a dictionary.

This book has been prepared to meet that need, and contains a
dictionary of six thousand choice phrases arranged synonymously for
general use; many polite expressions, phrases of charm and courtesy,
for use in letter writing; one hundred sample social letters, including
instruction concerning the method of their preparation by the use of
the dictionary of phrases; a guide to choice phrases for social letter
writing; and finally, a handy index, very helpful, even though the
phrases have been arranged in dictionary form.

I have made an effort to emphasize phrases of commendation, optimism,
and courtesy. Also many for use in letter writing——especially phrases
suitable for letters of condolence. There is perhaps no more difficult
letter to write than one of condolence, hence a considerable number
under this designation in order to assist in this necessary and yet
most blessed task.

The primary purpose of this book is that it may serve as a synonymous
phrase dictionary, yet I have so planned it that it can also be used
as a social letter writer. The dictionary of phrases is to be used
in letter writing in connection with the sample letters. In case the
sample letters are not desirable, the instructions and guide, upon pp.
275-81 will show how to use the book when one desires to write his own
social letters.

Some of the social letters were written by using the phrases in the
dictionary section of the book; others were suggested by the perusal of
the same.

The very fact that one keeps his eyes open for new expressions tends
to make him more careful of his own phraseology, and to encourage the
constant improvement of his own style either by the addition of old
phrases, new to him, or by the coining of new ones.

Whenever and wherever I have found in any volume, magazine, newspaper,
or in conversation, a usable phrase I have made note of it. This
method has given me the material for the book. As far as possible I
have endeavored to collect phrases which are the common speech of all,
phrases which are not quotations, and are the property of all.

I am very greatly indebted to all I have heard and read, especially to
the standard authors.

I have included and located a goodly number of phrases from Shakespeare
and the Bible.

                                                    _Pericles_, III., 2

Are you the lady of the house?
                                                 _Twelfth Night_, I., 5

How goes the world?

I thank you for your company.

I am heartily glad I came.
                                                _As You Like It_, I., 1

We leave you now with better company.

I take leave with many thousand thanks.

  The heavens give safety to your purposes,
  Lead forth and bring you back in happiness.

I desire more acquaintance of you.

                               _Request_

Bear me company.

Will you dine with me?
                                                  _Julius Cæsar_, I., 2

Let me have audience for a word or two.
                                                _As You Like It_, V., 4

Commend me to him.
                                               _Timon of Athens_, I., 1

Trouble yourself no further.
                                                      _Othello_, IV., 3

Which is the readiest way to the house of——
                                       _The Taming of the Shrew_, I., 2

If along with us, we shall be joyful of thy company.
                                      _The Taming of the Shrew_, IV., 5

Come home with me to supper; and I’ll lay a plot shall show us all a
    merry day.
                                             _King Richard II._, IV., 1

Go on before——I’ll presently attend you.
                                  _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_, II., 4

Will not your honours bear me company?
                                            _I. King Henry VI._, II., 2

I’ll keep you company.
                                                   _Coriolanus_, II., 3


                              _Response_

What your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
                                         _III. King Henry VI._, III., 2

I count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul remembering my
    good friends.
                                             _King Richard II._, II., 3

I’ll eat nothing; I thank you as much as though I did.
                                    _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, I., 1

Of much less value is my company than your good words.
                                             _King Richard II._, II., 3

I enjoyed the golden dew of sleep.
                                            _King Richard III._, IV., 1

Tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions that I
    cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman.
                                             _Timon of Athens_, III., 2

                                               _Twelfth Night_, III., 3

It is an honour that I dream not of.

A thousand thanks.

Hearty thanks.
                                                    _King Lear_, IV., 6

I thank you, you are always my good friend.

                               CRITICISM

                   Stricture            Animadversion

We are not all of that ilk

He is not able to get the right perspective

We are quite reluctant to follow his lead

He has no ground of complaint

He is in no small degree responsible for——

He shall be condemned in no uncertain terms

He cuts a sorry figure

He has no sense of the fitness of things

His conclusions are hopelessly detached from his premises

The theory has gone into bankruptcy

He is over-quick in reproof

He richly deserves his fate

I will not use terms of endearment

He takes himself too seriously

He has the unhappy knack of saying things that are not so

He should be the last man in the world to——

He is desperately in earnest but terribly mistaken

A purely professional cheeriness of manner

A most inexcusable breach of confidence

That sort of thing not only wearies but disgusts sensible men

It is a case of mean yielding in places of responsibility

Such a course is eternally alien to us

No one with any polite breeding can possibly sympathize with——

Too clever by half

I cannot resist taking him down a peg or two

Which is more than a figure of speech

A clumsy attempt

Not beyond just criticism

Little to charm the eye

An unfortunate notion

It is a situation to be lamented

Not altogether a wise thing to do

Not the most reassuring thing in the world

It presents an ugly aspect

Pure cussedness

The revival of an old humbug

A suggestion to be taken with reserve

It is but the legitimate offspring of his policy

A theory which has sins enough of its own to answer for

A little top-heavy


                               DANGEROUS

                       Perilous            Risky

Steering a wobbling course

Skating over thin ice

The risk is too plain to be blinked

Things which snuff the light out of life

The mischief is easier to do than to undo

A warning which we dare not ignore

It is to light a fuse

Most sedulously to be avoided

A shining mark for the attacks of——

A menace to true faith

Subversive of all social order

Nothing is more inimical to society than——

A standing menace to——

Risks it would be madness to take

It may easily become a bogey

It contains the muffled accents of compromise

The consequences of which it is exceedingly difficult to foresee

A concession which the future will deplore

It is a condition which destroys the morale

It is a fear which cuts the nerve

It has obvious risks

The perilous undertow of——

The blighting effects of pride

It seems a mere flying in the face of notorious facts to maintain
    that——

Taking all sorts of daring little liberties

The fatal folly of——

Can any one view that prospect with complacency when——

It is bad form to——

It is of doubtful propriety at best

It is a delicate and dangerous thing to do

It will sink beyond hope of salvage

A very precarious situation for obvious reasons

It is a perilous thing to do

He is a real man who should affirm that——

A bold stroke

A tendency to attribute undue importance to——

It never seems to give him pause that——

He laid himself open to attack when——

A delicate sort of performance

An awkward doctrine to preach now

A source of alarm

An evidence of sinister plot

A deadly menace to——

It will add fuel to the flame

A bit of fine-spun fallacious reasoning

A supremely critical hour

A danger of mistaking the eddy for the full current

A crisis in the affairs of——


                                DECEIT

                       Duplicity            Guile

Calculated to deceive the very elect

Hoodwinked by chicanery

It lacked every mark of authenticity

To play fast and loose with

Fair words have stolen away your heart

Birds of prey do not sing

Words which mislead and deceive the unthinking

A whole web of intrigue

An illusion born of vanity

It is a gigantic hoax

A man given to sharp practice

It was a mean decoy

He made a feint of going——

A cowardly subterfuge

As slippery as an eel


                                DEFEAT

                      Frustrate             Thwart

His last state is worse than his first

He is waiting for an excuse to climb down gracefully

Out of the frying-pan into the fire

It made serious inroads upon the——

His plans suffered an eclipse

From bad to worse

The plot thickens

It cost the pangs of keenest misery

They have been adversely affected by it

A sort of dehumanizing effect

An adept in getting into hot water

An omen of evil significance

We nipped it in the bud


                                DEFEND

                       Shield            Protect

In my humble judgment he did right

I should defend that with real verve

He should not be consigned to execration simply because——

There is not one jot nor tittle nor scintilla of evidence to show
    that——

The matter should not be permitted to go by default

We must place safeguards against further occurrences of the same kind

He does not do so perversely

I am going to defend him from the animadversions of——

He is above any such intractable position

He is a jealous defender of——

Truly it is not meet and just that——

One in order to maintain his self-respect must——

In spite of all that has been said to the contrary, I——

It is all very well for——


                                 DENY

                      Disavow             Disclaim

I wish to disclaim any responsibility for——

Nothing could be farther from the facts than——

He is wholly mistaken

I emphatically deny it without fear of contradiction

There was never a greater mistake

Quite the contrary

I am far from saying that——

It is a contradiction of terms

It is absurd to suppose that——

Far from it

It is a pure invention of mischief-making spite

We wish to disclaim any purpose of that nature

If any such idea found lodgment it should be dismissed forthwith as
    contrary to——

It is without a vestige of truth in it

It will be met by a flat refusal

It is too much of an extravagance to assert that——

We are not justified in making unqualified assertions

It is deliberately false

An absurd proposition hardly worth contradiction

No more false charge was ever brought

The thing was absurd and incredible on the face of it

Relegated to the limbo of——


                              DEPENDABLE

                    Trustworthy            Reliable

Something more than mere vaporings of the imagination

Unalterable principles of rectitude

It always has a strict business basis

Stable as the hills

As steady as a clock

No mere makeshift policy

Not swerving from the path of duty

Painstaking and faithful in the performance of duty

Of most rare fidelity

With unswerving fidelity to each and every trust

He does not play fast and loose

                       Wicked            Corrupt

The seat of vice

The throne of iniquity

The brood of the serpent

The pit of perdition

Another sinister symptom of——

Blacker than Egypt’s night

As black as the pit

He has dealings with the prince of darkness

An inspiration coming otherwheres than from heaven

Incurably asinine

From the harshest brutality to the lowest shade of petty meanness

In wanton defiance of every law of God and man

Manifold iniquities

The sum of all villainies

The deeps of degradation

The tents of wickedness

An unsanctified dream


                                 EXACT

                      Accurate            Correct

Mapped out with rigid precision

It will bear the test of exact criticism

He is capable of accurate estimate

As accurate as a time-table

No loose ends

No slipshod work

No unfortified assertions

Master of every detail

Severe exactitude

Faultily faultless

To be precise——


                              EXAGGERATE

                      Overstate            Overdo

He who proves too much proves nothing

Violence of statement

Stronger language than the facts justify

It is altogether too extravagant a fancy

Made out of whole cloth

He makes a mountain out of a mole-hill

He quite overshot the mark

A gross exaggeration

Extravagant promises

He made as much of his facts as they would carry

He went to the limit

He has shot his bolt

He sees a glow-worm and thinks it a conflagration

A difficulty we are apt to overrate


                              EXCEPTIONAL

                      Excellent            Choice

Second to none in importance

A star of the first magnitude

Of capital importance

The finest asset

A step of prime moment

The high-water mark of——

It calls for talents of rather an unusual order

A notable exception

On an unprecedented scale

How very unusual to find that——

Of a rather unusual sort

Its finest flower and fulfillment

The height of elegance

Of rare talent

It will not be easy to match

100% capacity men

Scarcely to be paralleled


                               EXPECTANT

                    Hopeful            Anticipatory

I am living in the fond hope that——

It bodes well for the future

A most reassuring phase

He hopes to ride safely into the harbor of——

The net effort seems to warrant the hope that——

There is a bare possibility that——

What a gleam of hope in——

We set out under happier stars

A promise of the future

I think we may indulge the hope that——

As hopeful as the dawn

We are enabled to look beyond the mists which fill the valley

Full of splendid promise

In the happy and beautiful millennial time when——

Rich in promise

Big with possibilities

A star in blackest night

I nurse a lingering hope that——

In all probability I——

It is the expression of a glorious fact that——


                              EXPERIENCE

                       Knowledge            Proof

The burnt child dreads the fire

A momentous experience

I have tasted all the consequences of——

There is no hunting but with old hounds

Experience is the best teacher

It is the consensus of experience that——

I can tell where my own shoe pinches

A word that has no meaning to him

Tried experience

I soon had occasion to know better

Of value to those who have eyes to see its significance

He is utterly heedless of the teachings of experience

This has been convincingly demonstrated in the past

Proof has been furnished with painful frequency

A testimony which is conclusive to all fair-minded men

An exemplification of——

The crucible of experience

Tested in the fires of experience


                                FAILURE

                   Ill-success            Shortcoming

He is headed straight for the auctioneer’s block

They have lost not only the meat from the bone but the bone itself

He beat the bushes and another caught the birds

He has fallen outside the breastworks

The wick in the lamp is already beginning to flicker

He has not made out a case for it

It is a fatuity

He was broken at the wheel in the attempt

An end of all that pleasing vision

My hand has lost its cunning

The tragedy of unfulfillment

In the vain hope that——

Many signs of hereditary degeneration

It has gone stale

Was there ever a maxim that proved so false

We have seen all the hopes snapped

Not functioning with satisfactory efficiency

After vain endeavors upon my part

The big fish ate the little ones

With few results and most of them not worth tabulating

In a bad way

It will collapse like a house of cards

At a low ebb

It is a prophecy that will sleep in a pigeon-hole

The keystone has fallen out of the arch

The idol is off his pedestal

Feeding on the swine-husks of——

Gone by the board

Dropped away like autumn leaves


                               FANCIFUL

                    Visionary            Capricious

It was a gallant dream

Based on ephemeral conditions

A mirage of iridescent tints

A dreamer of vain and impossible dreams

An illusion born of vanity

Nothing is more visionary than trying——

A rose-buddy sort of——

Purely fantastic

Idle dreams

Capricious ways

Various foibles

Ghostly recitals of——

The enticing illusions of——

Building castles in the air


                                FICKLE

                     Wavering            Changeable

Tossed about by every wind of doctrine

He is a creature of moods and moments

He is as whimsical as a butterfly

He is without anchor and without port

The mood of the moment

Conquered by every passing whim

The very sport of adverse winds

The caprice of the moment

No one can blow and swallow at the same time

Like a butterfly driven aimlessly before the breeze

An inspiration not amounting to a fixed resolve

An impractical sort of dreamer

The refinement of speculation

He flits from scheme to scheme

As changeable as the moon

Drifting like an idle straw at the mercy of the wind

Like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed

Fickle and irresolute

I am a feather for each wind that blows.
                                            _The Winter’s Tale_, II., 3


                                 FINAL

                       End            Last Resort

Dead without hope of resurrection

With an atmosphere of finality

I agree that you have spoken the decisive word

Reduced to barest terms

The irreducible minimum

In the final analysis

The court of final appeal

Ere the curtain is rung down on the drama

In his heart of hearts he——

The ultimate solution of the problem

It’s all over

We want no inconclusive settlement

Wellnigh snuffed out

The last sad estate

The ultimate goal


                                 FIRM

                     Resolute            Steadfast

Proof against all propaganda

As impregnable as Gibraltar

We stuck to our guns

Courteously but firmly expressed

The time for laying on a vigorous hand

I was utterly inexorable

He stands four-square to all the winds that blow

The same unyielding quality

With moral fixity of purpose

He resolutely declared his intention of——

In the unalterable decision that——

With implacable purpose

An impregnable bulwark against the——

In no uncertain terms

Master of the situation

The resolute kind

We have to be as unbending as truth

Hearts of oak

With unswerving fidelity

By strict adherence to——

As unalterable as the Laws of the Medes and Persians

A resolute decision


                                 FIRST

Exquisite fitness

The eternal fitness of things

Fruits ripening to their full value

A sense of the fitness of things

Most appropriate

As the hand fits the glove


                                FLIMSY

                      Weak            Superficial

There is very little wheat in that chaff

Your defenses will crumble at the assault

A faint kind of policy

Lack of recuperative power

What wretched dilettante business it all is

To what degree is this a fair-weather enterprise

Like the flimsy fortification of a cobweb

Little better than sound and foam

Without rhyme or reason

As frail and as fleeting as a bubble

It will make ludicrous the flimsy assertion that——

With rudimentary notions of——

The weak spot in the——

He may swim boldly who is held up by the chin

In a cheap and bizarre fashion


                               FORCIBLE

                      Weighty            Trenchant

In words of trenchancy

The driving wheel of the——

Presented in a striking and strong light

A very growing influence

The argument is irresistible

A formidable man with an idea

A crescendo of power

Of wonderful fortitude

Every ounce of strength and vitality

A power to be reckoned with

A telling argument

There is great potency in——

Clear-cut and convincing

In no measured terms

A compelling reason


                               FORTUNATE

                        Lucky            Favored

I could not help felicitating myself that——

I feel very grand at this issue of things

I thank my good star that——

I am thankful that Providence managed otherwise

It was uncommon luck that——

I was certainly fortunate in that——

By a turn of good fortune, I——

                       Basal            Permanent

It is well to have a few well established limitations and restrictions

The solid fact behind it all is——

The one indispensable qualification for——

A settled principle as old as the hills

Of permanent significance

One of the root reasons

My own irrefragable argument for——

The old simplicities of faith

A faith centered in the everlasting

Subject to the eternal things or perish

A guiding principle which admits of no exceptions

Thinking things through to their final and logical outcome

The elemental realities

The eternal verities

As old as the evening star

A basis of enduring justice and right

The established states of human society

Like deep calling unto deep

At the root of things

It makes for the permanent stability of——

The ultimate fact is——

As well founded as the law of gravitation

Long-cherished opinions

A solid underpinning

A very vital equation in the problem is——

Strong and deep-rooted beliefs

The underlying reasons

Solid reasons

One of its fundamental tenets

They have gone down beneath superfluities to bedrock

The fundamental principle is irrefutable

The abiding significance of——

So solid in principle that it has resisted every shock

At the bottom of all


                                FUTILE

                     Useless            Unavailing

The protest was of no avail

The proposition is equally _aliunde_ and futile

I might as hopefully have entreated the wind

He would dig a well with a needle

He catches the wind with a net

Scanty prospects

It is a hopeless proposition

It is futile to——

I am afraid he is indulging in a futile hope

The matter will never be consummated

Their hope is without foundation

He is on a fruitless errand

It will result in the inevitable breakdown of——

But in spite of all our optimism the evidence is overwhelming that——

That has been tried before but with no distinct success

The game is not worth the candle

It has cooled my resolutions

It may be something of a damper to be told that——


                               GENEROUS

                     Liberal            Magnanimous

A man of generous disposition

Built on a generous scale

Not the least mite stingy

Kindly disposed

A revelation of tenderness which is very reassuring

With noticeable consideration

His kindness knew no bounds

A generous view of life

No man of breadth cares one whit whether——

Large minded men with liberal views

A breadth of outlook

Broad tolerance

A magnanimous man

In the most generous fashion

A people known for their warm hearts

Kinder than the kindest


                                GIFTED

He is my beau ideal in every respect

He has a genuine aptitude for business

He has considerable colloquial talents

He is finely qualified by exceptional advantages

Of rare powers

Of no ordinary faculties

He is a man of many fascinations

He is one who can think for a commonwealth

You can leave it to him for being clever

He is a man of real ability and fitness

One of the most fascinating persons I——

He rendered brilliant service in——

Few men have rendered more conspicuous service

He possesses in an unusual degree the power of——

He shakes the pillars of the temple

He presided with rare dignity

He is the organizer of victory

He could not fail to delight a cultivated public

He plays with wonderful expression

                    Good-natured            Cheerful

He is anointed above his fellows with the oil of good-feeling

In his happiest mood

The era of good feeling

A bit of good-humored chaff

The friendly relations so happily subsisting between——

He did not think it in any way demeaning to his dignity——

Put the best construction upon every action

Like a boy before a holiday

Grumpiness is no feature of his nature

An irrepressible youthfulness of heart

Beaming with good humor

His nature is all sunshine

As full of happiness as a hive is full of bees

As merry as a child

Happy as an angel

A real delight to me

A source of æsthetic pleasure

Those were halcyon days

His good humor was so infectious

A breezy good-humor

The era of good feeling

The happiest moods which can fill the soul


                                GROUCHY

                     Petulant            Irritable

As sullen as an ill-tempered boy

The impression of pure pique

Skulking in his tent

As impatient as the wind

In a huff

Symptoms of an attack of nerves

He could brook no delay

Sullen silence

Tears of vexation

One in whom the milk of human kindness had turned sour

One of those people who make themselves wretched and pass on their
    misery to those near them

A man with a hair-trigger constitution

He does not suffer fools gladly

So provoking

I shall be right glad when——

Solemn as the day of judgment

He took umbrage at what I said

Not in a particularly genial frame of mind

As acid as vinegar

As gloomy as an old man by a fireless hearth

I’m afraid he started the day in a contradictory mood

A censorious attitude toward one’s fellowmen


                               GULLIBLE

                       Ignorant            Stupid

Given out for gospel to the ignorant

An easy mark

The optimism of ignorance

The prey of profiteers

I am afraid he will be taught by many a sore and scalding lesson

The easy prey of——

He fell into the trap

He nibbled at the bait

The unsuspecting victim of——


                               HABITUAL

                       Customary            Usual

He had become habituated to——

Of frequent iteration

An inveterate habit

Of immemorial usage

Over a well-beaten path

Addicted to the habit of——

He moves in a rut

Custom calls me to ’t.
                                                   _Coriolanus_, II., 3

Until it shall become an indispensable and delightful habit


                                 HASTE

                       Rapidity            Hurry

A high-pressure haste

With all practical speed

As quick as a wink

A concession to the requirements of brevity


                                 HASTY

                       Premature            Rash

A little premature

Crossing the bridge before we come to it

We need not say good morrow to the devil until we meet him

Unseemly haste

The more haste the worst speed

He shocked the proprieties

It would be premature to forecast the——

He ran before he was sent

It is too early at this time to state the——

Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
                                             _Romeo and Juliet_, II., 6

The letting down of restraint

The loosening of bonds


                               HESITANT

                    Reluctant            Indecisive

I should hate like sixty to——

His heart was not exactly set upon the matter

In a mixed mood

This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd

With perceptible hesitation

A certain disinclination to——

He was unwilling to go the full length

For a moment I was at fault——

One almost feels reluctant to——

It may make us hesitate in making our dictum too positive

I had little inclination to do so

The paralyzing hesitation of self-consciousness

After a sufficient show of reluctance

I confess it is not without trepidation that——

I am duly sensible of my own limitations

It is not without reluctance that——


                               HINDERED

                      Hampered            Straits

Hard pressed by the cohorts of——

At a distinct disadvantage

Attended with many inconveniences

A series of singular perplexities

Certain unforeseen emergencies

Entangled in technicalities

As helpless as a sick child

As helpless as animals driven to slaughter

Helplessly caught in the meshes of——

They will doubtless do their worst to bring about a——

Many plans disrupted

It slackens resolution

Impaired its usefulness

Eking out an all too small living

A man who wants bread is ready for anything

Necessity is the mother of invention

The greatest drawback to my comfort is——

For every new method a counter-method


                                HONORED

                       Noted            Acclaimed

Recipient of most unusual attentions

The thought of him doth breed in us perpetual benediction

A man of splendid merit

His star is in the ascendant

Treated with great consideration

One of nature’s noblemen

No man is a hero in the eyes of his valet

There is none so poor to do him reverence

A name which stands very high on the scroll of fame

A tribute of reverence and love

He reaps golden sheaves who——

A high compliment to——

Whom to have known was a great pleasure

He is easily the foremost man in——

A man whose life is rich in unselfish service

His attitude wins universal admiration


                                 HOPE

                    Promise            Encouragement

Prisoners of hope.

We are saved by hope.

The eye of the Lord is upon them that hope in his mercy.
                                                      _Ps._ XXXIII., 18

Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast.
                                                         _Heb._ VI., 19

We are perplexed, but not in despair.

Thou shalt be secure because there is hope.
                                                          _Job_ XI., 18

The children of promise.
                                                         _Gal._ IV., 28

He hath given everlasting consolation and good hope through grace.
                                                    _II Thess._ II., 16

Hope to the end.

From strength to strength.
                                                       _Ps._ LXXXIV., 7

He staggered not at the promise of God.
                                                         _Rom._ IV., 20

When the human heart sings with rejoicing hope

When smiles begin to chase the tears

A real breath of heaven

With radiant face

A draught of heavenly pleasure

A triumphant hour

A lively sense of exultation

The dove of peace sings in our hearts

I begin to discover somewhat of His beauty

Transported with joy

A current of pure and hallowed joys flowing through the channels of the
    heart

An intense inner happiness

A most happy glimpse into the things of God

Secret essences which turn life into a garden of unspeakable delights


                               HUMOROUS

                       Ludicrous            Funny

A candidate for the psychotherapeutic clinic

This is one of the consequences of getting into good society

Isn’t that a sad state of affairs

It was excruciatingly funny

I threatened him with unspeakable things if——

Less mobile than I could wish

You are appointed the official——

Can you imagine anything more ludicrous than——

My roseate expectations have recently suffered a very severe setback

A strong spice of Irish wit

Bonds for your good behavior will be required

Irresistibly droll

A fusillade of laughter

An awful illustration of——

I was in stitches

I’m in a pickle

Now will you be good

He has a whimsical way of expressing himself


                               IMPARTIAL

                        Just            Unbiased

Every man has a deep seated instinct for fair play

The thing must be done decently and in order

Strictly impartial

If we are to make both sides balance we must——

Let us not revert to old animosities


                             IMPECUNIOSITY

                     Penniless            Involved

In a state of habitual impecuniosity

A hand-to-mouth existence

No woman marries an old man for God’s sake

He has seen better days

In desperate circumstances

The futility of riches

In more affluent days

In reduced circumstances

Deeply involved

In embarrassed circumstances


                               IMPORTANT

                    Significant            Momentous

It was a high day in the——

It is noteworthy that——

A work of paramount importance

Each man has a vital part to perform

This is no small problem

Of transcendent moment

It is imperative that——

One of the great outstanding features of——

One of the most significant items was——

It is a fact of tremendous significance that——

The notable feature of it all is——

Great days

The crucial question is——

Profoundly significant

Of no little moment

There is the fact and it is one of cardinal importance

The one outstanding reason for——

Back of it lies one fact yet more primal

This is the one thing needful

The dominant note of——

It must weigh sensibly with every one

It is high time that——

It has momentous importance

It is worth making note of that——

I dare not abate my vigilance


                              IMPOSSIBLE

                   Hopeless            Impracticable

As easily as one could mend a spider’s web

As impossible as to count the stars

It is virtually impossible to——

There is no getting blood from a turnip

A practical impossibility

No more than one can sail past the north star

It is simply out of the question

It is not in the least degree likely that——


                              INDEPENDENT

                    Flippant            Uncontrolled

With an air of injured innocency

He cares not a fig

It matters not a straw

It matters not a whit whether the——

He cares little for conventionalities

It is not worth shucks

It is not a matter of the slightest consequence

He brushed the matter aside as a vagary

With smug complacency

He held himself perfectly aloof from——

Without blush or tremor


                              INDICATIVE

                    Evidential            Disclosing

It is a straw pointing with evidential import

Where there is so much smoke there is some fire

Straws show which way the current is set

What an apocalypse that will be when——

There are not wanting signs that——

A most infallible indication of——


                              INDICTMENT

                   Arraignment            Accusation

None the worse for a spark of decent indignation

The hollow shams and conventionalities of our day

No adequate sense of His holiness

Baser than a beast

No keen and poignant perception of sin

The lessening sense of sin

His own heart as cold as frost

Sad and sinful days

Our hearts hot with wrath and indignation against sin

Evil to its core

The devil’s signet

Of decidedly earthly passions

All dried up in one’s soul

Lust was kindled in his heart

Base, mean, prudential, paying no tribute to the Divine excellence

The parching blight of sin

Beware of artful, designing persons

Sins come in groups, in battalions

Like the frosts of sin which blight the sweet blossoms of youth

And taste the tang of the bitter cup

The hundred and one enemies of our peace, comfort, and efficiency

The burning poison in his veins

There is nothing more likely to betray a man into absurdity than

It vexes, grieves, thwarts, repels, drives off the Spirit of God

Beware of the beginnings of sin

Over head and ears in debt and drink

The peril of riches

A coronet of shame

The secret beginnings of sin

An eternal arraignment of all who——

By so doing, he is sowing the seed of a fatal infection

Trifling with great spiritual realities

Lest it might lead to things undesirable

The horror of a bottomless pit

Habits which quietly sap the foundations of life

Words which will shock some dainty soul

A sickening devotion to the pursuit of wealth

The evils of unrighteousness in civic life

It seems to contradict the designs of Providence

A narrowing effect on the conscience of those who have embraced it

Care lest one be inveigled into perdition

Words which ought to make us twinge

Words of worldly wisdom

A brewing storm of hostility

The world’s hardest battlefields of sin and sorrow

In their hearts the feuds of ages

A wretched, dejected, sin-blasted soul

Carnality in the heart

The great enemy of mankind

The black enormity of sin

A miserable grudge in your heart

The spawn of the evil one

A heritage of hate

A dauntless worldling

From whose very touch one’s delicacies shrink

The fires of a sensitive religious experience no longer glow

The grip of evil forces

All alarming, all hateful, all detestable

A gnawing sense of condemnation in the heart

Those who abuse God’s great gift of speech

Some of these enormities put to blush heathenism itself

No deeply seated opinions of right and wrong

A state of lazy indifference

Apparently destitute of ambition

Worthy neither of respect nor honor

Soft and easy days

Mean, petty, social prejudices

The temptation to fritter away life in interests that are small and
    mean

Everlasting confusion

The enemy shall come in like a flood

The man that speaketh froward things

The resurrection of damnation

A rebellious house

God resisteth the proud

The works of darkness

Unstable as water

Spreading himself like a green bay-tree

The words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his
    heart

Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool
    than of him

An unprofitable servant

His mouth is full of deceit and fraud

The wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire

A sad vocation

A heart of adamant

A hardened cynic

The vain things

The enormity of sin

A scoffing world

A defeated one

Tenements of dust

The jealous eye

The everlasting burning

The hell of hate

A despicable heart

A sullen silence

A disdainful glance

A brittle promise

A sorry specimen


                             INDIFFERENCE

                      Disregard            Apathy

It is not worth a moment’s regard

Let “by-gones” be “by-gones”

It is a matter of no importance

Cast it to the winds

What is past shall go for nothing

Of it I really make no account

Let it pass

Quite apathetic

The exceptions are so few as to be negligible

Extremely trivial

In one ear and out at the other

The edge of my inclination is much taken off

A half-hearted interest at best


                               INFLUENCE

                        Control            Sway

In the hollow of his hand

What he says has great force

It gripped like steel bands

His words touched me most profoundly

He dominates the situation by the sheer force of his personality

A bright beacon shedding light

The creative influences of——

He succeeded in making his presence felt

One cannot get within gunshot of——

It roused the last smouldering spark of——

It may have far greater consequences than——

In the seats of the mighty

Far reaching in its consequences

It does not have a feather’s weight with practical men

Leaven that is gradually purifying the world

Salt that keeps civilization from decay


                               INGENIOUS

                        Shrewd            Adroit

A situation that requires artful handling

He understands the fine art of the omission of unessentials

He is temperamentally gaited to do things

It was cleverly done

He carries the torch of his genius into——

Taxing the acutest ingenuity of——

With the intuitive sense of affairs

Shrewdness of perception

A masterly exhibition of adroitness and skill

A first-rate master of affairs

He has conceived the happy idea of——

By hook or by crook

A surprising way of——

They will have to do a lot of political tight-rope walking to——

It must put him to his trumps

A fertility of resource that——


                              INTERESTING

                   Fascinating            Impressive

On tiptoe with expectation

As eager-hearted as a boy

My eyes have been wide open for——

I am mightily concerned to think out how——

It is a matter in which I have a most heartfelt concern

It is highly interesting to note that——

I was fascinated by——

It has all the fascination of an adventure

Life would be very dull without it

An element of excitement in it

Everything to fascinate the imagination

A fine touch of romance in it

He was very keen to gain possession of——

With unflagging interest

Every man rides his own hobby

What is new is always fine

The signs are multiplying that——

The circumstance which gave it such a thrilling interest is the fact
    that——

It was decidedly impressive

We are not indifferent to——

Fascinating as a Romance

I read with quickened attention the——

This was his meat and drink

There is a growing disposition among——

You have quite excited my curiosity

As fascinating as a romance

It holds the interest with a good grasp

A fascination for many minds

Of enthralling interest

I know the nicest little secret

I have news for you


                             INTRODUCTION

                             (Of Speakers)

I have the esteemed privilege of presenting——

I feel highly honored to have the opportunity to present——

I have the great honor of asking you to welcome——

I esteem myself fortunate to have the privilege of presenting——

I count myself happy in being permitted to——

We have with us to-night ————. It is my very great pleasure to present
    him

It is my good fortune to be called upon to introduce ———— the speaker
    of the evening. Let us give him an attentive hearing while he
    speaks to us upon the topic——

I have very great pleasure in presenting to you the speaker of the
    evening ————. He will address us upon the topic——

It has fallen to my lot to introduce one who is known to many here. I
    have great pleasure in presenting ————


                             INTRODUCTORY

                    Prefatory            Preliminary

                      (For General Conversation)

It goes without saying that——

I am obliged to confess that——

It was a happy thought which led me to——

I venture to propose that——

We had great fun when——

I indulge the modest hope that——

It must be very gratifying to you to——

I am deeply persuaded that——

Reverting to another matter——

I ought not omit remarking that——

And so it befell that——

After expatiating on the——

It is a very curious circumstance to see how——

I frankly confess that——

It is really disconcerting to find that——

I am revealing no secret in saying that——

I must not leave you under misapprehensions so——

I am rather inclined to the opinion that——

I do not find anything in the tenets of my religion which requires me
    to——

I have a peculiar tenderness for——

As I am continually saying——

In a very humble way, I——

My impression is that——

The upshot of it all was——

Far be it from me to——

It is hardly necessary to add that——

You will be very much pleased to hear that——

I will venture to express a hope that——

I have but one rule to guide my conduct and that is——

I have been strongly tempted to——

Besides this there is to be said——

There is but a thousand-to-one chance that——

It is an open secret that——

I have an impression that——

I informed you wrongly when I said that——

If I mistake not, I believe that——

If I may use the expression I think that——

Quite regardless of my remark, you——

I had the inexpressible comfort of knowing that——

He made a touching proof of his regard by——

I flatter myself that——

Is it not a great mercy to have such a helper

Again and again, I——

Inadvertently, I——

I felt like uttering a mild disclaimer when——

I have little predilection for——

I had the rare satisfaction of——

I was strangely moved when I heard that——

There is a certain distinctive advantage in——

I was amazed to find that——

In my poor judgment, I——

I hold in all seriousness that——

Has the tide of victory set in your favor

By what magic have you found out the secrets of——

We have plumed ourselves upon our ability to——

As luck would have it, I——

To be candid, I——

It seems a positive calamity that——

Do you seriously imagine that——

No one could be so rash as to assert that——

I am satisfied that——

I strongly suspect that——

I fancy that——

Further than this——

Paradoxical as it may seem——

I dare say that——

It is with great pleasure that——

It would ill become me to remark that——

For instance,——

The redeeming feature of it all is——

Quite by chance, I——

I have been wondering whether——

In all probability we——

It is not likely that——

Luckily I——

It is a singular coincidence that——

I took particular pains to notice whether——

It is with problems such as these that——

How very fortunate it is that——

It is a particular piece of good fortune that he——

As a matter of fact, I——

None the less, I——

It can be admitted too that——

Certain it is that——

In some quarters it is believed that——

If that be the case, I——

I confess I look with some alarm at——

I have the great good fortune to have heard that——

I realize afresh that——

The art of arts is——

I flatter myself that——

It is from the heart that I can request that——

I am perfectly convinced that——

The full gravity of the situation is seen in the fact that——

Regardless of anything I said——

I am painfully conscious that——

I wasn’t by any means sure I——

It dawned upon him gradually that——

It is seldom that——

We may be quite sure that——

I have repeatedly said that——

It cannot but carry with it instant conviction that——

By some mischance, I——

Prior to this, we——

I was greatly elated to find that——

I am heartily glad that——

I had a happy thought to-day which I——

I cannot but realize that——

It is scarcely conceivable that——

Frankly, I——

It is intellectually unthinkable that——

On the other hand——

I appreciate most deeply the——

I am devoutly thankful for——

At all events——

I rather apprehend that——

I have sometimes thought that——

It must be owned too, that——

I scarcely feel as if I——

I rather imagine that——

To this day I hardly know whether I——

A very striking proof of the fact is——

I will hazard the observation that——

On the other hand——

May I give you an instance

It is quite indifferent to me whether I——

He used frequently to observe that——

Now that I am a little seasoned, I——

I have heard him often lament that——

You may guess what luck——

I regret extremely that——

It would have been quite out of the question for us to——

Recently I came across this——

I was about to inquire what you thought of——

I have the deepest veneration for——

I suppose the inference we are expected to draw is——

I am confident of one thing that——

My principal motive for acting thus was——

I am fully aware that——

I perceive, moreover, that——

It is surely true that——

I marvel that——

I sometimes fancy that——

I humbly conceive that——

I apprehend that——

Of course, I am perfectly aware that——

I presume that——

There are pretty certain indications that

It often amazes me that——

It seems hardly probable that——

I affirm that——

I have the consolation to hope that——

It is still permitted us to hope that——

It would be futile to deny that——

It is reasonable to assume that——

There is no prospect that——

In these circumstances it——

I suppose that——

I warrant that——

I confess I am not indifferent to——

I shrink instinctively from——

I confess a less and less relish for——

I am impatient and querulous under——

It is a sort of presumption to expect that——

I cannot imagine to myself——

I have a kindly yearning toward——

I heartily approve of——

I do not advert to——

I have long believed that——

It has long been the fashion to——

I have been falsely assuring everybody that——

One cannot help noticing that——

There are plenty of evidences that——

The difference, I take it, is this——

The fact of the matter is——

If I rightly remember——

It is a just cause for praise that——

It was a happy circumstance for me that——

I wish with all my heart that——

I am grateful to find that——

I devoutly wish it may prove to be that he——

It is not to be supposed that——

My attention has been directed to the——

I have a mental reservation with regard to——

A very affecting circumstance happened yesterday

I have a story worth telling

I had the rare distinction of——

I had a very civil note from——

If I may hazard a conjecture, I should rather think that——

It was unusual for me to——

He seems to be obsessed with the idea that——


                                  JOY

                       Gladness            Bliss

In the sweetest fellowship

Strains that sweetly soothe

An atmosphere of tranquillity

A new-found joy

Tears of joy and gratitude

In joyful anticipation

With joyful enthusiasm

Possibilities of which we hardly dreamed

A balm for the weary

A joy divine

Songs of sweetest praise

A triumphant hope

Thrones of love

A heaven of love

                    Judgment            Indignation

He must be brought sharply to book

Brought to the bar of justice

Impartial justice

A noble contempt for deliberate wrong-doers

Fired by righteous indignation

The eternal principles of justice

The foe of tyranny

The well-established right of every citizen

Very intolerant of sin, but not vindictive

A life strictly legal


                                 KEEN

                        Foxy            Cunning

With a special axe to grind

He caught you napping

A piece of sharp practice

A shrewd surmise

A bit of keen reasoning

Too ingenious by half

Neutrals think to tread on eggs and break none

As cunning as a weasel

A mind like a steel-trap

Bait the hook well; the fish will bite.
                                       _Much Ado about Nothing_, II., 3

Reared in the school of diplomacy

A discipleship with mental reservations

He turns a blow with a jest

A kindly soul

I could not find it in my heart to——

It pulls upon our heartstrings

Cherishing a cordial good-will to all men

I cannot find it in my heart to——

Free from all care

He suffers from acute laziness

He wants to be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease

He treads the path of least resistance

His mind cankers

Predisposed to loiter

How can I attempt to comfort you in the bitter affliction which has
    befallen you

Would there were more like——

I regret to hear of your continued indisposition and hope that before
    long you may return to your wonted good health

A sweet and uncomplaining spirit

I should rejoice if I could be with you

I can only send my sympathy and best wishes for your speedy and
    complete recovery

Courage——hope remains

Time will heal many heartaches

May the Father of Mercies give you the rich consolation of His grace
    and preserve and strengthen you for your family

May you be sustained in this most bitter trial

The grateful sense of your kindness will never be erased from my mind

If my services can in any way assist you do not hesitate to ask for
    them

I am sincerely sorry to hear of your loss

He carried the riches of God within himself

He was a royal-hearted man

We are greatly afflicted by the melancholy intelligence which reached
    us that——

I knew the sterling integrity of his character

May God breathe into your heart peace and cheerful resignation

My mind is filled with very grateful memories

He was greatly beloved

I fall back upon a very delightful verse of Scripture: “He is able to
    subdue all things unto himself”

My heart is filled with the deepest gratitude as I think of ————

We send our earnest wishes for your speedy recovery

My most affectionate regards to ————

You seem to have your full share of human vicissitudes

He had such a fund of courage and good cheer

Dear, sweet, loving mother

A letter replete with tenderness and affection

All things work together for good to them that love God

A bruised reed shall he not break

Many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all

It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of
    feasting

He giveth his beloved sleep

A very present help in trouble

We took sweet counsel together

God will take us into their goodly company some glad day

Glimpses of the reality which we instinctively feel will sometime be
    ours

The unmeasured things of hope which God has prepared for men

Our lives we must humbly commit to the guiding hand whose blessing we
    adore

Filled with strong consolation

There are many avenues by which God would come in and richly bless us

He had the secret of keeping the sacred fires aglow

He knew the deep principles of experimental religion

Ordinary consolations do not avail us

He knew the secret of beautiful living

He was a silent witness of right living

Many admiring friends

One who ministered so carefully and tenderly

All the more tragic because——

And this thought will be our comfort that——

Of gentle presence

All the gentle virtues came into full blossom

Looking forward with a Christian’s bright anticipation of a glad
    reunion

Persisted in keeping mind and spirit on the sunny side of life however
    hard the trials and difficulties

Mother’s fortitude and hopefulness is a lesson to us all

We send our united and sincere condolences

The news of your painful loss has been a great surprise to me

I have read of your bereavement with the deepest sorrow

You, who have so often comforted others, are now to be comforted

May you live in the confidence that ———— is in the enjoyment of
    everlasting happiness

It is a great comfort to us that

Words are inadequate to express my feelings

There are times when one cannot express himself in written words

The pen refuses to express adequately my sympathy to you

I sympathize keenly with you in the loss of your excellent ————

They are not lost to us

God will surely give you a kindly guidance in this hour of trial

The intimations of a future life shall some day be realized and we
    shall see and know again those whom we have “loved, and lost
    awhile”

Many beautiful traits made up his character

I join with you and his other friends in mourning his death most
    sincerely

It shocked me very much

I have heard with the greatest distress of——

I had learned to have a very warm feeling for ————

I had been intimately enough associated with him to feel that I knew
    him very well

Cast thy burden upon the Lord

Thou hast known my soul in adversities

I know their sorrows

A refuge from the storm

A shadow from the heat

In the furnace of affliction

I will hedge up thy way with thorns

Tribulation worketh patience

Our light affliction

In all their affliction he was afflicted

He healeth the broken in heart

For a small moment have I forgotten thee but with great mercies will I
    gather thee

God that comforteth those that are cast down comfort you

We shall have to bear our crosses with meekness and patience

So good a friend is capable of making any calamity light

The great loss you have sustained has caused me much uneasiness

I know not how to express my sorrow at the news which I have just
    received

That God may give you great consolation under this heavy burden is my
    fervent prayer

I should be glad if I could suggest anything to lighten your trouble
    and make your path a little more smooth and easy

Such a sad circumstance has come to you

Your sorrow’s night

When one’s heart is unspeakably tender

We extend our heartfelt sympathy

In your hour of trial

She was such a beautiful character, loved by every one

In these lonely hours you must not be cast down for there is help from
    God

His Word says that they that wait upon Him shall renew their strength

She was God’s good angel in your home

Grief that saps the heart

I account you mine

His name will long linger in our household

We must be brave in the face of trying circumstances

Of gracious memory

She bears up with the utmost fortitude

I received the melancholy intelligence last evening that——

He was the kindest, and most generous of men

The sweet remembrance of the just

A workman that needeth not to be ashamed

If God be for us who can be against us

Of whom the world was not worthy

Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth

Let not your heart be troubled

I know that your heart must be sorely grieved

God shall overcome this King of terrors

It is written, “As thy days so shall thy strength be”

We expect to see our loved ones in happier, brighter worlds above

God is able to soothe and sustain the distressed soul

May God’s love shine more and more in our hearts until the day breaks
    and the shadows flee away

He careth for you

A stronghold in the day of trouble

A covert from the storm

We unite in sending our love and sympathy

With warm regards

We beg you to accept our commiseration

Our hearts sorrow with you

He is such a very great comfort to us

We are uplifted by the assurance that——

A light which sorrow cannot quench

We must all wait the call of God with a calm trust

Let me have the comfort of hearing from you

The hand of God has been heavy

His sterling qualities of character will leave an indelible impress on
    those with whom he associated

His good life will live on

Dying in the triumphs of faith

Securely anchored in the never failing promises of God

A life of good-will, kindliness of spirit, and firm character

The benediction of his brotherly heart will bless many who knew him

We must live in the blessed anticipation of the glory that is to come

Do not fear, for God knows what is in your heart

Your path seems full of thorns

Your weather is bleak, but the storms will cease

Your sky is dark, but the sun shines

May the everlasting arms sustain you in the flood of sorrow

May God comfort you

Out of the thorn springeth the rose

I know you are in grief and heaviness

We commend you to the mercy and grace of God

The bitterness of affliction

The present floods of sorrow

You will have to cast your anchor in the dark

May your heart be constant

The Lord will surely give you rest from the days of adversity

I would that you should always have the sweet experience of the
    consolations of God

We all have the good-will of Him who dwelt in the bush

My heart is heavy for you

We must wait till the fair morning of the resurrection

I write my blessing, earnest prayers, the love of God, and the sweet
    presence of Christ to you and yours

You have suffered a grief which no human friend can assuage

I feel deeply your misfortune

I am grieved to hear that——

We are greatly concerned about——

We are sometimes called to sow in tears, but the harvest will be a
    series of everlasting joys. This blessed hope softens the trials of
    life

My times are in the Lord’s hands

I hope it may please God to endue us with a proper temper, and quiet
    perseverance, and that these trials may help us to purify our
    motives

One of the severest and most trying dispensations of Providence

Yours is indeed deep sorrow

You have the blessed reflection of having done all that could possibly
    be done

You have my earnest prayers that the Almighty may graciously support
    you

That the Almighty may bless, support, and comfort you, is the hearty
    prayer of——

Be assured of our cordial esteem and fervent prayers

May every consolation and blessing be granted to you

As long as I shall remember anything, I shall remember her virtues and
    her kindness

I hope I need not tell you how anxious I have been since I first heard
    of your great loss

May I share with you the deep sorrow you are called upon to bear at the
    loss of your——

My prayer is that you may be wonderfully sustained by Him who hath
    said, “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”
                                       Most sincerely yours,

I commend you to Him who hath said, “There shall be no more death,
    neither sorrow.”
                                       Affectionately yours,

May you have great comfort in the presence of Him who hath said, “I
    will not leave you destitute.”
                                                Your friend,

Ever remember the good word which tells us that “He shall change our
    vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body,
    according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all
    things unto himself.”
                                           Faithfully yours,

Though we pass through the valley and the darkness of death let us fear
    no evil since He is with us.
                                           Ever your friend,

God gives us a fine assurance concerning the future in the word which
    says, “For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
    were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
    hands, eternal in the heavens.”
                                        Most sincerely yours,

With a prayer for every blessing on your self,
                                 Affectionately, your friend,

Be assured of our cordial esteem and fervent prayers.
                                        Very sincerely yours,

May God that comforteth those that are cast down comfort you in this
    trial is the prayer of
                                                 Your friend,

We can meet the trials of life in the comforting conviction that this
    mortal must put on immortality.
                                        With warmest regards,

No doubt you are inclined to say that all is vanity and vexation of
    spirit, but do not do so for He knoweth the way that we take.
                                            Faithfully yours,

Now that the time has come that you are “Like Niobe, all tears” also
    the rather remember the word which says that “God shall wipe away
    all tears.”
                                        Most sincerely yours,

We send our love and commend you to Him who hath said He will “Swallow
    up death in victory.”
                                        Most sincerely yours,

While your heart is heavy, and one feel quite deserted, yet we can be
    much comforted in remembering that “He knoweth our frame.” and is
    ever mindful of us.
                        With sincere sympathy,
                                      Your friend,

                             MILITARISTIC

                      Martial            Soldierly

The zone of hostilities

The harmless victims of war

Tactical retreat

Martial enthusiasm

A crack regiment

Universal disarmament

Strict neutrality

The inevitable horrors of war

A military advantage

The ruthlessness of war

The neutrality of nations

The international equivalent of the policeman’s club

The lust of empire

The cruel indignities of war

The long-nurtured passions of a nation

When the thunders of war are heard around the world

The arbitrament of arms

A test of materialism

An age crammed with war

The federation of the world

The policy of military preparedness

The patriotism of the common people

A military tattoo in the streets

The dominant military power in the world

The nightmare menace of war

The crime of Cain multiplied a million fold

The maintenance of peace

A sin against civilization

The stunning sense of some great calamity

The futility of militarism

The theater of hostilities

The allied armies

The pitiful misery of the people

An appalling cost of human life

The diplomatic corps

A compact front

Wanton destruction

The military camarilla at ————

Military necessity

Deliberate and wanton vandalism

With ruthless hand

The guilty madness of war

The inveterate belligerence of ————

A crushing indictment of Twentieth-Century civilization

The city tense with the excitement due to militarism

Imbued with the spirit of war

Prepared for vigorous operations

Under cover of the artillery

The oft-trodden battle-ground of the Low Countries

A warless world

An armed peace

The mailed fist

A religion of valor

The terrorism of military might


                              MYSTERIOUS

                      Dark            Inscrutable

Into those invisible regions where we cannot follow

Clothed in a cloak of mystery

The fascination of the inscrutable

In some incomprehensible way

It seems a Sphinx whose riddle no man can read

Shrouded in mystery

A great deal of hokus-pokus

Hidden under the impenetrable veil of metaphor

Absolutely inexplicable

It was Greek to me.
                                                  _Julius Cæsar_, I., 2

Some enigma, some riddle.
                                        _Love’s Labour’s Lost_, III., 1

A bottomless sea of speculation


                              NECESSARILY

                    Needfully            Essentially

The pressure of absolute necessity

I am under the imperative necessity of——

It is absolutely essential that——

It must needs be that——

Infinitely more so now

The imperative necessity of——

The need is urgent that——

Of all the essential cogs in the world’s great machine the——

Of extreme importance

Of vital necessity

Conditions will make it imperative that——

It is of prime importance to——

The first and most important requisite of——

Put to it

The supreme need of the hour is——

It is time for him to come to the scratch and——

All important factors in the case

As much as plants need sunshine

Indispensably necessary

The imperative needs of——

In the vigorous school of necessity


                               OPPORTUNE

                      Timely            Seasonable

Every door is open

Virgin soil

A work in which every man may bear a share

Seize with avidity this opportunity to——

The time seems ripe to——

The keynote to——

Entrée to all the best

Open sesame

A plain opportunity for——

We must take opportunity by the forelock

Had I been so disposed, I——

The hour of opportunity

Now is the time of all times to——


                              OPPOSITION

                   Protestation            Objection

Nothing could go more against the grain with me than——

He set his face like flint against——

There is a decided opposition to——

It is one of the counts in the indictment against him that——

He was debarred from——

With strongly divergent opinion

He should be unhorsed

A man who must be discriminated against

It is sheer nonsense to——

The thinness of that kind of argument is seen in——

Hotly contested

His one weapon of defense is——

He made of this fact a telling answer to those who——

It is common to hear deprecations of——

He would have made a more happy effect if——

All this is in direct contradiction to——

Through flinty opposition

Persistently hostile

It has only one defect——it is not true

I differ from him very widely

It is a cry that is raised in the old senseless spiteful way

It is scarcely worth raising our heads to look at

I assure you such is not the case

I think it would be quite inadvisable to do so

It is a convincing demonstration of the fatuity of the notion that——

The latest and most absurd theory is——

Issues which are poles apart in their true significance

I regret to be compelled to join issue with you

The answer will be a firm and decided negative

I have inly resented the——

I must with all respect demur

It is a wooden-headed scheme

It represents everything repugnant to my convictions

I cannot refrain from expressing my regret that——

It is a manifest absurdity

In which case I should remonstrate

I protested in vain

It is very annoying to me

I fervently hope not

A good stout protest

It is out of the question

A decided negative

It is time to protest and to protest vigorously

I won’t hear it without a protest——

It has not even the saving grace of——

He met with stout opposition

He came out squarely against——

He rubbed the cat the wrong way

They will brook no trifling

A point-blank refusal

There is just ground for objection in the fact that——

It is not exactly fitting that——

There could be no greater fallacy

It was the only rift in a perfect lute

Unless they made a fidget about it

The whole plan is repellent

The suggestion arouses in us only moral disgust

Give it the lie

Such an opinion runs counter to the facts

He delivered a frontal attack upon——

It is playing at cross-purposes

Promptly and vigorously disposed of

It is going to get a short shrift

A railing accusation

A storm of protest

Stubborn resistance

In the face of mighty passions and desires

In the teeth of clenched antagonisms

It is time to protest and to protest vigorously

Not under any circumstances

Too heavily handicapped

A disposition in some to resent

A combination of hindrances

Without flinching

An insuperable barrier

I have the greatest aversion to——

He met with a hot welcome

A defiant note


                               OPTIMISM

                       Cheer            Gladness

I am very sanguine about it

In a highly gratifying way

It is refreshing to know that——

The uplift of great ideas

All clouds do not rain

No day is so long but has its evening

No news is good news

All is not lost that is delayed

One of the most heartening signs of the days is——

We are with you to the last man and the last dollar

I have a crumb of consolation in the thought that——

We can say with much assurance that——

The plan has attractive features

With unalloyed satisfaction

This is no time to intone funeral ululations

Let us strengthen each other’s hands in God

We need a ringing message to steel the purpose

We are with you from center to outer edge

The news is decidedly reassuring

I was splendidly heartened by——

A word of magnificent promise

A happy confidence

Let’s make the best of it.
                                                    _Coriolanus_, V., 6

A day of great things

One of the bright sides of a dark picture is——

Our lucky star was in the ascendant

In spite of dismal forebodings

In the heyday of confidence

He meets every situation with an inspiration

On the victory side

In the mountains of God

A harbinger of success

Life’s brightest meaning

A bad beginning may make a good ending

No such inept and doleful talk has been coming from——

Cheering in a high degree

In his happiest mood

The outlook is in the highest degree encouraging

We have reason to thank God and take courage

Everything is propitious

The night is long that never finds a day

A pack of blessings

A buoyant optimism

Prospects are very bright for the success of——

The finest game in the world

I have nothing dismal to remember

A happy earnest life

Without grudge or grumbling

A hopeful attitude

An attitude of assurance

An inborn belief in the superiority of——

Always hailed with joy

Quickening and cheerful influences

Assuredly we shall win

Of splendid augury

The habit of expectancy

A hopeful prospect

A promising beginning on intelligent lines

It is bound to accomplish a world of good

A brisk cheerful sense of things present and things to come

Some cheerful hope-laden ideas

No gloomy forebodings

We will have the fun of beginning again

An abiding optimism

With high expectations

Not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers

The most hopeful sign of the times is

I know nothing more pleasant than to

This is indeed good fortune

How pleasant it is to

I have had a great piece of luck

Let us turn to more pleasant reflections

But, after all, in this as in everything else one must be hopeful

Unquestioned confidence

Without the least misgiving

It is an assured success

Conscious of being able to cope with the situation

Genuine confidence

It is in no wise inimical to your interests

To believe him guilty of deliberate mendacity would be painful

With undiminished confidence

With radiant hopes

We are able for it

A place of peace and unfailing cheeriness

A cheery greeting

In high glee

With many a cheering smile

He manifests a cheerful willingness

Deeply and unfeignedly happy

It is a cheerful sign of progress when

He is capable of taking the highest view which the circumstances of the
    case may admit

He has the habit of holding an expectant attitude

To attain that will be a supreme delight

He is all the time pressing forward with keen expectancy

There are many hopeful aspects of the situation

The situation is greatly improved

May we have a part in bringing in a new and better day

A happy augury for the future

A happy prospect

Like a sunbeam on a winter’s day

With superb optimism

Let us do it with a shout

A jubilant mood

I am fully prepared for all eventualities

He is quite sure of himself

He has a new and sure grip on the facts

In the full assurance of success

It may be averred with confidence that——

I have every assurance that——

In the result alone will be confidence

I have the certitude of all this

He staked his faith on——

With the easy assurance of——


                                PARTIAL

                      Incomplete            Meager

A beggarly account of——

The whole truth is not known

That is not the sole question

We have not heard the whole of the facts

He does but scant justice to——


                                PASSION

                       Fervency             Zeal

Like a fire in the bones

With soul aflame for truth and justice

His one absorbing passion

His whole concern centered in——

The thought was like a raging fever

With a great strain of the eternal in his message

A spiritual passion which would break through all formal proprieties

He seemed obsessed with the desire to——


                               PATIENCE

                    Endurance            Forbearance

What can’t be cured must be endured

A small stock of patience

Time brings everything to those who wait

We must placidly bear the strain of——

You have an infinite deal of patience

With the most angelic patience

Least said, soonest mended


                               PATRIOTIC

                      Democratic            Loyal

Putting other ambitions aside in order to serve his country

A noble temper of patriotism

The great humane movements of events towards liberty

The accents of democracy

Against the notion that whatever is profitable is right

A passion for ideals

The unspeakable boon of freedom

The foundations of a mighty nation

Aflame with the spirit of opposition against tyrannies

A thorough-going patriot

A magnificent spirit of self-abnegation

In the ardor of self-sacrifice

Hearts afire with love for liberty

Unshakable loyalty

Emblem of everything we hold most dear and desirable

A royal pride of country

Soundly and unimpeachably a loyal citizen

The new patriotism

The golden age of the federation of the world

A world-wide democracy

A United States of the world

A world patriotism

A universal alliance

A league of peace

A glorious future for the nations of the world

International patriotism

A democracy as broad as humanity

International federation

The new prosperity

One of our chief claims to glory is——

Universal democracy

A supreme court of arbitrament

A peace federation

The end of autocracies

The end of secret diplomacy

It is subversive of every principle of our democracy

Pan-Americanism

The menace of military might——

The most far-reaching extensions of freedom and democracy the world has
    ever known

The unconquerable mind of freemen

As fine soldiers as ever despised death


                              Shakespeare

This land of such dear souls, this dear-dear land.
                                             _King Richard II._, II., 1

Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s, Thy God’s, and

Let men say we be men of good government.
                                             _I. King Henry IV._, I., 2

Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts, that no
    dissension hinder government.
                                          _III. King Henry VI._, IV., 6

I do love my country’s good with a respect more tender, more holy and
    profound.
                                                  _Coriolanus_, III., 3

    conqueror.

                                                     _Cymbeline_, V., 4

Good fortune bids us pause, and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful
    looks.
                                          _III. King Henry VI._, II., 6


                                PENALTY

                     Punishment            Forfeit

Sent to cool his heels in——

He got what was due to him

He is face to face with the remorseless judgment of his times

He would have been put to it to have gotten into a worse quagmire
    than——

This will make interesting reading for——

Reaping a dragon-tooth harvest

The direct result of his own unsocial acts

The direful consequences of——


                               PERPLEXED

                     Nonplused            Mystified

Utterly at sea

I am really at the end of my tether

I am mightily at a loss to know what——

This further complicates the problem

And in like quandary I find myself touching the——

It is very vague

I had it inchoately in my mind

We cannot make much of it

His thoughts do not run in the natural order of sequence

An inextricable dilemma

My wits faint.
                                             _Romeo and Juliet_, II., 4

Involved in inextricable confusion

Left in a mood of perplexity

Utterly inscrutable

The problem is surely perplexing

Full of confusion worse confounded

It would serve only to becloud the issue

A question of sufficient complexity to tax the power of the wisest


                              PESSIMISTIC

                       Cynical            Gloomy

A peddler of pessimism

He has always had a plentiful stock of gloomy ideas

A heart of lead in my breast

It hangs like a dark pall over——

The unpleasant intelligence of——

The most ominous feature of it all was——

Any attempt was foredoomed to failure

No rosy delusions should be permitted to warp our judgment

There is a little of the melancholy element in——

Augured evil

Doleful recollections

Smothered under the wet blanket of——

He indulges in the gloomiest forebodings

A most discouraging frame of mind

Fallen into the Slough of Despond

I found myself under my juniper tree

It is the very mystery of perversity

He is in a woeful state of mind

A sense of desolation

There came upon my heart an intolerable burden of despondency

A dreary conclusion

The unexpected and adverse strokes of fortune

A damper of my hopes

A gloomy consolation

A discouraging moment

Friendless, homeless, hopeless, undone

Impossible of accomplishment

Grave symptoms

A forlorn hope

A nameless foreboding

One has to be optimistic to find anything hopeful in the present
    outlook

A somber and mournful aspect

A sign of ill omen

He has the habit of dating existence by the memory of its burdens

A sea of trouble

Under the pressure of calamity

A welter of sordid interests

A very flood of wretchedness

A sorry plight

Moments when one grows sick of mankind

Inexpressibly miserable

A very gloomy report

He is etching the black pictures deeper and deeper into his
    consciousness

By some strange fatality

Hearts bursting with despair

A terrible legacy

With a groan of sickening remorse

With a sense of desolation

Many vicissitudes

All true in a finished civilization

He has seen many a bitter day of sorely tried hopes

The many accessories of evil

Crushed by burdens

The misspent strivings of mankind

Errant human nature

To move in paralyzing dread

Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward

A particularity which converts every trifle into a thorn

A dark and stormy sea


                              PICTURESQUE

                       Poetic            Graphic

The singing river

The place of wraithing tempests

The mood of poetry

The slow wind crooning among the pines

The dank odor of autumn leaves

The scent of damask roses

A skein of cloud

A star of orange light

A dim blue haze

A gently sloping hill

A shimmer of golden sunlight

A blossom passing fair

Delicious days

A cloud of fire

Lingering lover-wise

A billowy prairie

Nodding grasses

Rugged seas

The merriest voices of the spring

Deathless music

The jargon of the tempest

Lovely, ivy-mantled

Checkered with sunlight and shadow

The distant gloom of foreboding mountains

Bewilderments of beauty

The ermine of the snows

Marble dawns

The first kindling stars of dusk

Pine-grown mountains

_En rapport_ with the earth

A bewildering field of fragrance and delight

A robe of verdure

The inviting air

Lovely clusters

Gracefully pendent

Delicately adorned

The balmy breath of spring

Fair as virgin snows

Grand with imperial purple

The silence of eternity


                                PLEASED

                       Glad            Delighted

Sweeter than honey and the honey-comb

I am quite in raptures with——

To my great satisfaction, I——

I do not know a pleasure more appealing than——

You cannot imagine what pleasure it gives me to——

I went on my way with a merry heart

There is a certain undiluted bliss in——

Cheering in a high degree

Could anything be more agreeable than——

As bright as a sunbeam

I am very glad and genuinely pleased that——

I think it admirable and meets the case fully

The most gratifying features of the——

Frank delight

Out of sheer enjoyment of doing it

I dote upon it

It was most gratifying

I enjoyed it prodigiously

Not an inconsequential part

This is indeed a pleasure

I greatly rejoice in the——

We always look back with pleasure to——

It is gratifying to know that——

I was never so proud of it as I am to-day

This is the panacea for all my disabilities

This is the elixir of life

I had the good fortune to——

This is certainly ideal

Enamored of——

Perfectly in raptures over——

To my agreeable disappointment I found that——

Genuinely glad

I am quite delighted

We were delighted beyond measure

To my inexpressible delight

Much to our profit and delight

In the most delightful fashion

A day I still recall with pleasure

It exceeded my greatest expectation

A wonderful time

This is the sort of thing I enjoy

I like the idea very much

That’s simply splendid

There is an unfailing charm in it

A delightful idea truly

I like it prodigiously

Isn’t that jolly

Of first-rate merit

I was highly pleased with it

It was in the best taste

It is a beautiful piece of industrial accomplishment

I call it a delightful spectacle

A capital idea

Altogether a fine thing

A sentiment worthy of emulation

A source of constant pleasure

A very real asset

With none of the slight faults of immaturity

It is an uplifting habit

The sight filled me with admiration

Of no ordinary cleverness

It was perfectly splendid

It is a fine instance of

It called forth unqualified admiration

It was strikingly impressive

The result exceeded my most sanguine expectations

The finest flower that ever blossomed

It is an amiable habit by no means to be discouraged

Genuine gratification

Much to our profit and delight


                                 POINT

                          Crux            Gist

Very much to the point

That is the very core of it

There is the milk in the cocoanut

You hit the nail on the head

The crux of the whole matter is——

The paramount issue is——

More truth than fiction

That is where the shoe pinches

It went straight and close to the very heart of——

That is the sum and substance of the whole matter

To the point

Here in a nutshell is the——

The case could not be put more succinctly

An epitome of——

The very quintessence of——

To comprehend it all in a word


                               POLITICAL

                   Diplomatic            Legislative

An unworthy piece of legislation

An odious piece of class legislation

A grave indictment of independent citizenship

Names of genuine weight on the roster of delegates

Signs of a genuine awakening in the nation

Deliberate malfeasance in office

A flagrant offense against public opinion

Indulging simply in pure buncombe

Logrolling schemes

A public disgrace

A blaze of popular resentment

Political fakery

Blind partisanship

An unfortunate deadlock

Public apathy

Under the old régime

In the initial days of the campaign

A shifty self-seeking politician

Astute diplomats

A corrupt public sentiment

From long association with politics

The real state of affairs in the nation

The last word of political wisdom

The pressing questions of the hour

Facts officially winked at

Recreant to a solemn trust

A sincere desire to safeguard the public

Refreshing to the people

Close to the heart of affairs

Hesitating at no extravagance

These recriminations go on endlessly

An era of good feeling

For political advantage

Scrupulously avoiding any offense against his party

One of the most prominent and potential among the leaders of his party

One cannot blame him for being resentful when the organ of his party
    flouts and ridicules him

He is quick to anticipate the veerings of public taste

It is regarded as a mere eczema on the body politic

The engrossing questions of the day

We must set ourselves to hunt out helpful policies

A stroke of diplomacy

Guilty of gross political impropriety

In the throes of an acute political crisis

A diplomatic victory

A new world order

Special interests

Political vicissitudes

Desirable reforms

Certain inalienable rights

Astute leadership

Political prestige

Leaving the individual decision to each man’s enlightened judgment

Upon the firm foundation of liberty, justice, and equality

Conspicuous in public affairs


                               POSSIBLE

                     Contingent            Probable

In the event that——

If conditions are favorable

If the Fates smile

It is possible and not by any means improbable that——

The argument is thoroughly convincing if——

The antecedent probability is——

Entirely within the realm of probability

It is highly probable that——

It is by no means unthinkable that——

There is a bare possibility that——

In any event——

If this is an acceptable explanation then——

Were it not for “If” and “But” we should all be rich forever

That is humanly conceivable

Perfectly possible

It might be a very happy means of——


                              PREJUDICED

                        Biased            Narrow

A prejudice sevenfold in thickness

Wresting it to suit a preconceived theory

Blind prejudices

It is another case of not being able to see the woods for the trees

The wish the father to the thought

He is crotchety and full of conceits

He is wedded to his opinions

He has no adequate idea of the task

It is a piece of embittered old fogeyism

It is based purely on personal considerations

Arrogantly ignorant

He approaches every problem from a preconceived point of view

He gives his energies to fanning the flame of——

For an unprejudiced mind it is not difficult to admit the
    reasonableness of the claim of——

Subject to spasmodic deafness

If he doesn’t understand a thing he damns it


                               PRIVILEGE

                      Latitude            Freedom

The grant of a blank check

A free hand

It leaves a charming latitude of guessing

_Carte blanche_

Free from all allegiance to——

He exercises a freeman’s right

Tenfold the justification for——


                               PROGRESS

                     Advance            Development

The growing magnitude of——

It passed from a dream to a reality

It is fated to grow into greatness

It is a step forward in the right direction

It will mean that we have taken a big step toward——

It forged a new link in the chain of progress

A thorough-going reform

In no small degree the progress is due to——

Now we have passed away beyond that

Unhampered development

A genuine step toward——

The desire is growing by geometrical progression

A constructive program

An aggressive movement

The chariot of progress

In the experimental stage


                               PROPHESY

                      Conjecture            Guess

The suggestion is not wholly fanciful that——

Judging the future by the past there will be——

My forecast was correct

Whether or not he accurately divined all the——

It is altogether likely that——

We may probably conjecture some of the steps

A sure precursor of——

Only a bold prophet would predict when the——

Extravagant conjecture

I lay no claim to the predictive function of a prophet

’Tis likely by all conjectures.
                                             _King Henry VIII._, II., 1

One may hazard the conjecture that——

A purely supposititious case

The hypothesis is based upon the supposed fact that——

Purely guesswork


                                PURPOSE

                        Aim            Ambition

It has been a settled policy of my life to——

It is singleness of aim that gives him driving power

A man careless of all save the pursuit of his ideal

A great solidarity of purpose

To fulfil our purpose it is necessary to see clear and think straight

The problem has now to be envisaged from a wider angle

He is under the domination of great ideals

The purpose is unimpeachable

He is working toward the accomplishment of some high purpose

With rare purity of motive

We trust the scheme has been planned upon adequate lines

Not swerving from the path of duty

Simply and solely for the purpose of——

The avowed aim of——

A high degree of unity of purpose

Serious purpose

Filled with lofty aspirations

That’s the golden mark I seek to hit.
                                            _II. King Henry VI._, I., 1

Spirits are not finely touch’d but to fine issues.

Dominant aims


                              QUESTIONING

                    Interrogation            Inquiry

In what essential respect does it differ from——

Of what avail is it if——

Let us raise the inquiry how——

I would like to venture a question

Have you come upon any traces of——

You probably mean by that——

Is not that sufficient explanation

Can I depend on you

May I ask why——

On what grounds do you base your decision that——

May I inquire what your version is of——

How does this method of procedure strike you

What would you do under existing circumstances

Have you remarked the——

What boots it that——

How shall I understand you?
                                               _Timon of Athens_, I., 1

Adroit questioning

What are your predilections

How do you relish——

I must beg leave to put a query


                                 REAL

                       Actual            Genuine

After stripping off a lot of thin veneer we find that——

It touched the vital springs of reality

It is not make-believe

The creed was transmuted into an experience

It brought him face to face with reality

Incontestable evidence of the truth and reality of——

The outward and visible sign of far-reaching realities

It savors of unreality

In a very real sense

In order to be real we must——

With a passion for reality


                              REDEMPTION

                   Compassion            Forgiveness

As far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our
    transgressions from us.

Like as a father pitieth his children so the Lord pitieth them that
    fear him.

I will refine them as silver is refined.

In whom we have redemption.

Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling.

Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
    mercy he saved us.
                                                        _Titus_ III., 5

Moved with compassion.

Washed white from crimson sins

The process of becoming perfect

The right temper of the soul

The Divine hostility to sin

Brought into saving relationship

The ultimate purpose of redemption

A redeemed fellowship

The dynamics of the redeemed life

In God’s eternal economy

The Divine method of doing things

The splendors of redeeming grace

The unspeakable humility of Calvary

An eternal redemption

The mysteries of redemption

A wealth of unveiled glories

Rich in sanctity, wisdom, and redemptive power


                               REFERENCE

                      Relation            Respect

We cannot blink the fact that——

Apropos of the——

It must be borne in mind that——

With regard to——

He sapiently remarked that——

A case in point is the——

I am almost ashamed to advert to it

Unless my memory fail me, I recall that——

As the matter now stands——

In order to resolve the difficulty in question we——

No harm can come from restating calmly the——

Heretofore

I am always telling that to——

Thanks to the generosity of——

This is only a mild side-light on the——

You were just speaking on a very interesting topic

We can never remind ourselves too frequently that——

We must keep it in the forefront

I cannot divest myself of the impression that——

Incidentally, it would be well to remember that——


                                 REGRET

                     Remorse            Compunction

It is too late to lock the stable-door when the steeds are stolen

It was a sorry business

It needs a lot of explaining

Decidedly unfortunate

It is a matter of regret to me that——

A distinct disappointment

That is a great pity

A thousand pities

I am quite provoked at my own stupidity

Not a pleasant experience

Most vexatious blunders

I am awfully sorry to miss the fun

It is pathetic

Is it not truly deplorable that——

Unfortunate in effect

It was the most humiliating experience possible

More deeply still should I deplore it if——

The remembrance of them is grievous unto us

I was profoundly mortified at——

No one regrets more than I do the——

It was a matter of no small regret that——

It has not been very good fortune to——

Had I but served my God with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not in mine age
Have left me naked to mine enemies.
                                            _King Henry VIII._, III., 2

Poignant regret

Frankly regretted

I feel like calling myself a simpleton for——

Unmistakable signs of a change of heart

He has made a clean breast of it


                                RELIGION

                     Morality            Reverence

The eternal God from whom all goodness flows

The vision of redeemed and purified humanity

It saps the defenses of justice and morality

It requires the purging fires of divine judgment

The moral and spiritual height of God’s heaven

No religious consciousness

A glow of religious satisfaction

In quest of the divine treasure

The white flower of a blameless life

Man proposes and God disposes

It shows that the flame of reverence is burning low

There are no memories like the mercies of God

The murmuring woe of the world became as a bugle call to him

A lover of God

Purely kingdom business

Be sure God is satisfied with you

We are wholly certain of the righteousness of our cause

A sentiment in the highest degree spiritual

Friends of my soul

A man who carries the riches of God within himself

Redeemed and royal-hearted men and women

Caught up into the third heaven

The unmistakable signs of divine guidance

Acquiring the art of spiritual expressiveness

The beautiful realm of the spirit

A day of rich spiritual experience

Let never day nor night unhallow’d pass
But still remember what the Lord hath done.
                                           _II. King Henry VI._, II., 1

A nice point for a tender conscience

Of none too severe morals

A spark of heavenly fire within

Reverential of all that is great and noble

The mountains of God

A kindly soldier of the cross

No supposititious consequences will make it right if the thing is not
    right in itself

Violations of moral rectitude

The triumphant inhabitants of heaven

A gate to immortal glory

The doleful effects of sin

In everlasting honor

A magnificence of spirit

The bounty of heaven

The adorable excellence of God

Banished from the blissful things of God

So big that it must be of God

A devotion to veracity

Heart-hunger for the divine

A life of serenity

Uplift by the power of Christ

The ineradicable instinct of the religious life

                       Response            Answer


                             (Affirmative)

I have the pleasure to concur with you

I am perfectly of that opinion

That is precisely my view of the case

It is an admirable way of putting it

It is extremely interesting, I can assure you

It fits exactly with my notion

It will be generally acquiesced in

I shall be most happy to grant it

I will with great pleasure

It sounds plausible

I am quite content to leave the judgment of it to you

I am pretty fully in accord with——

I can see the desirability of such an arrangement

I am sure the happiest results would ensue


                               (Negative)

The answer is a plain negative

I am quite unable to say

I should think it very unlikely

I haven’t the remotest idea

It is a sufficient answer to the foolish view to say——

I have neither grace nor gifts for such a responsibility

I am ignorance itself in this.
                                           _I. King Henry IV._, III., 1


                            (To Compliment)

It is very kind of you to say so

I am grateful for your good opinion

Thank you for your good words

You are very kind

I am extremely glad you approve

Allow me to reciprocate by saying that——

I am pleased to hear you say so

I thank you for the compliment


                              (To Request)

I shall proceed at once to forget it

I shall respect your confidence

I shall be most happy to grant it

I prefer to reserve my judgment

I shall be most happy to come

Willingly, if you wish it

With pleasure


                               (Tactful)

I should as soon tell you as any one I know

I regret that I have never given the subject due consideration

It is a problem which no stretch of ingenuity can solve

Now, as they say, you are asking me a question

Ask me something easy

I am neutral

The deponent sayeth not

What part of Ireland are you from

I defer to——

Now I am quite out of my depth

I should feel peculiarly embarrassed to answer

And what is your judgment on that point

I am not at liberty to say anything more

What leads you to that conclusion, if I may ask

What an extraordinary observer you are

It is too remote for reminiscence

That is a fascinating field for difference of opinion

It seems that it is a case difficult either of proof or disproof

There seems to be a very great diversity in our sentiments


                              (Of Thanks)

It is good of you to say so

How lovely of you

I reciprocate your good wishes

Thank you for your cheerful words

You give me more credit than I deserve

It is really a pleasure to assist you

I feel amply repaid for my effort

I appreciate keenly the favor you have shown me

It was delightful I assure you

I feel indebted to you for your kindness

It was very thoughtful of you

One cannot be thankful enough for good friends

It was altogether delightful


                             REPREHENSIBLE

                    Blameworthy            Culpable

Out of the purvue of respectability

In bad odor

Worthy of all blame

Viewed with disfavor

Weighed in the balances and found wanting

No argument in its favor has been advanced which is not a reproach to
    repeat

A perfectly proper protest against

It must be dismissed as moonshine

It is worthy of no credence

Is there anything so utterly odious as——

A piece of ridiculous conceit

Just as ill-considered would it be to argue that——

Not yet purged of sinister aims


                             RESPONSIBILITY

                  Accountability            Liability

It is a condition and not a theory which confronts us

There is no blinking the fact that——

Facing the facts

Facts are stubborn things

A responsibility made new and doubly solemn by the march of events

The assumption carries great liability

Moral intrepidity

The obligations of victory

It cannot be shrugged away


                                 RESULT

                        Issue            Outcome

I would most gladly know the issue of it.
                                             _The Winter’s Tale_, V., 2

In the after-glow of——

It is the natural corollary of——

It will have to await events

The effect will be most unhappy

It is largely a consequence of——

Direful consequences

One of our inheritances from——

A happy consummation


                                RIDICULE

                        Scorn            Sarcasm

He has the art of saying nothing with immense seriousness

He needs to be wooed back to consciousness by soft music

Now comes the cruel pricking of the bubble

Laughed out of court

He was not taken very seriously

He is admirable in small doses

A little thin-blooded

The last expression of boredom

A thin veneer of truth

Rather the projection of his own imagination than a historical reality

In the throes of another dream

Note how thin the argument is

Splendidly ineffective

A position suited to his powers

He has the vice of stupidity

My tears refuse to flow

Damned with faint praise

He sneered at proprieties

His pump needs priming

Of course there are certain to be wiseacres to say that——

It has only one defect——it is not true

He takes himself too seriously

He lifted up his raucous voice against——

It would be entertaining to hear what——

His sagacity is no more to be admired than his modesty

I have tried to read him without skipping

Wonderful to relate

Growing beautifully less

Not worth the powder to shoot him

A trifle dull

He devotes himself to leisure with much assiduity

He is never troubled with a serious thought

The slightest modicum of common sense would teach that——

One half humbug and the other half hypocrisy

Very material tastes and ambitions

Pretty playthings

Fanciful pipe-dreaming

There is no activity within his cerebral cavity

A toy avalanche

He watched the proceeding from the seat of the scornful

One or two notches short of perfection

Confess you have dreamed this

After the wont of his kind

He is romancing

Possible but still improbable

Too sanguine

Too eager

Small talk

Sharp ridicule


                              SACRIFICIAL

                    Unselfish            High-minded

We must give ourselves to the great new tasks

We have a sacrificial atmosphere now to breathe

We live in the presence of a sacrificial spirit

We must sacrifice to international relationships

Willing to go into the darkness of death that liberty might live

In the grip of a sacrificial spirit

From unselfish motives

Without any ulterior motives

A few rare souls who think no evil

Unconscious of a mean motive

With a nobility all its own

Very willing to accede to a suggestion

I will take it into serious consideration


                               SALVATION

                       Grace            Holiness

Hearts sensitive to His presence

Sweet with the perfume of God’s breath

A spotless splendor that holds us in fascination

To them that nestle down into his will, God is like a mother

All the loving links that bind us to heaven

The psalm of adoring lip

The ceaseless exercise of reverence

Tokens of His favor

In those lofty moments when the soul is near God

The riches of His great grace

The river of rare and exquisite delights

In the highest realms of aspiration

A treasury of golden thoughts

Elements which have the luster and preciousness of pearls

Kept from the entanglements of sin

A heart made pure and right

The unforgetable memories of a pure home

The purest of the pure

A way of fortifying one’s soul

Moment by moment I’m kept in his love

Steadfast in the strength of God, and true

The free and kindly intimacies of the fireside

The fair realities of the sanctified life

The peaceful atmosphere of good will

Make a covenant with your eyes lest sin get into your heart

We must get corruption out of the heart for one never knows how it will
    betray

An infinitely loving and all-wise heart

Worthy to receive endless praise

Far up the everlasting hills in God’s own light

The hallowed beauty of the eternal God

The glorious outlines of His holiness

The pure pellucid waters of His grace

Illumined by the indwelling of eternal light

The presence of the most high God

The all-wise and gracious counsels of God

The unshadowed depths of eternal holiness

The adoration of the eternal

A celestial melody

In resplendent glory

In the mountains of God

The great and blessed God who inhabits eternity

The unblemished holiness of heaven

Enabled to act continually with integrity

Free from narrow and selfish motives

The grand truths of redemption

The news of mercy

The mighty Sacrifice

The sons of peace

The paths of peace

The heavenly steeps

The life-giving stream

The glory of holiness

The well-spread table

The river of regenerating energy

A joy-giving truth

The sacred longing of the soul

The enduring brotherhood

A new ideal of plenty

A beautiful faith

The eternal spirit

And I ... am satisfied and therein do count myself well paid.

Of a kind to gladden the heart

A son of consolation

A suggestion of better things to come

When every moment is a joy

It is so satisfying

I had the secret satisfaction of

I was wonderfully pleased with it

With great satisfaction

Complete satisfaction

An unmixed satisfaction

Quite content in almost any one’s company

It is ample reward for the hardships endured

To a nicety

That fine delight I always experience when I

It will answer your largest expectations

It will challenge your highest esteem


                                 SECRET

                      Hidden            Concealed

No word of the affair ever saw the light

I shall keep perfectly mum about it

Do not herald it abroad

Tell it not in Gath

I should appreciate your confidence

Stall this in your bosom.

                   Susceptible            Impressible

As sensitive as a barometer

Fearful of having committed an indiscretion

A delicate plant and can be destroyed

The raw edges of life chafe him

Sensitive to a fault

Highly susceptible

Quick to respond to any overtures of interest

Impregnated with the sense of——

As impressible as wax to the seal

I have been decidedly impressed by——

There are things which stamp themselves indelibly upon the memory


                                 SIMILE


                               (General)

As light as a snowflake

As fragile as glass

As grave as a judge

As rough as a bear

As still as a statue

As swift as a thought

As fierce as a tiger

As blithe as a bird

As old as the moon

As evanescent as a bubble

As deep as the sea

As graceful as Apollo

As beautiful as apple-blossoms

As hard as steel

As dark as pitch

As fierce as flame

As fleet as an arrow

As black as ebony

As white as snow

As thin as a shadow

As flat as a flounder

As sharp as a needle

As smooth as glass

As pale as a pearl

As welcome as a friend

As blind as a mole

As busy as a bee

As dry as dust

As fresh as a rose

As happy as an angel

As elastic as a steel spring

As dumb as an oyster

As illusive as a dream

As weak as water

As sweet as angel-dreams

As swift as a shadow

As short as a dream

As distant as a star

As cheerless as the Arctic

As black as ravens’ wings

As gray as ashes

As sharp as a sword

As white as chalk

As bold as a hawk

As clear as a whistle

As dull as lead

As broad as the sea

As hushed as the grave

As hopeful as the dawn

As soft as the south-wind

As swift as lightning

As sudden as thought

As clear as cloudless noon

As vague as a dream

As dry as a reed

As blue as violets

As hard as a stone

As invigorating as a sea-breeze

As happy as a child

As lithe as a panther

As impatient as the wind

Like wax to receive impressions

Like steel to retain impressions

Like one in a dream

Like the sea at rest

It clings like a burr

                                 SORROW

                      Bitterness            Grief

Burdens pressing down upon head and heart

A feeble lonely soul

Heart longings

A picture of despair

A life of struggle, grief, and pain

With inexpressible longings

A struggling heart

The appalling darkness of Gethsemane

The lonely way of isolation

On a beach of wrecks

He walked with bleeding feet the flinty path

A figure of woe fit to melt the most obdurate heart

The struggling myriads of the poor

The noble army of martyrs

Like a sad and poignant refrain

The roots of bitterness

Ill tidings

A heavy heart

The hour of misfortune

Passing through the school of affliction

It is a tale for tears

At the mercy of the merciless

Sorely in need of consolation


                               SQUELCHED

                    Silenced            Discomfited

Paid back in his own coin

Suffering the inevitable consequences of his own disagreeableness

Received a sharp quietus

He was compelled to take a back seat

Stick to your own knitting


                            STRAIGHTFORWARD

                        Candid            Frank

It was open and aboveboard

A candor which disarms criticism

There was no pretense about it

Perfectly frank and straightforward

An unequivocal rejoinder

Straight out from the shoulder

The message was explicit and unequivocal

With absolute frankness

With no inclination to blink facts

He does not seek to belittle the fact that——

Straightforward integrity

A frank, whole-hearted recognition of——


                                STUBBORN

                    Impervious            Obstinate

Impervious to argument

He is not the least bit clever

He was perversely slow to——

He is too stupid to make a blunder

As impassive as a statue

He is inflexible to all entreaty

He has been inexorable to all invitations

The victim of his own prejudices

The dupe of his own stupidity

Empty of the kernel of good sense

He made a plump refusal

It is like trying to use a large screw-driver to turn a small screw

Altogether obtuse

Not a grain of novelty in it

The zealous stupidity of amateurs

Prodigiously stupid

He is as stubborn as hickory

He turned a deaf ear to——


                                SUCCESS

                     Victory            Realization

My most sanguine hopes have been realized

But still we got on

He has the rare combination of audacity and calculation which assures
    success

No inconsiderable victory

It has proved a distinct success

Nothing venture nothing have

A very auspicious beginning

A project likely to be realized

I have a reasonable confidence in the success of the——

The indispensable foundation of successful work

We must capture the innermost citadel

His star is in the ascendant

It is a great day for——

Not because of the tactics used but in spite of them

It ought to prove a solar plexus blow

It is a great achievement

It is a hard won triumph

No inconsiderable victory

It was a triumph of sheer grit

The sinews of victory

The opposition disappeared under the fierce fires of——

A victory which shall achieve the high purpose which we have held

Attained only by those who intently seek it


                               SUFFICIENT

                        Ample            Plenty

A land flowing with milk and honey

Like a spring whose waters cannot fail

Of a not inconsiderable degree

With ample room

All that heart could wish

A superabundance of——

A word to the wise is sufficient

Let me put you on your guard

Let me make a suggestion

Let me put a bee in your bonnet

A suggestion, perhaps, may be ventured that——


                               SUGGESTIVE

                                                        _Rom._ XIII., 8

A wounded spirit who can bear.
                                                     _Prov._ XVIII., 14

Riches certainly make themselves wings.
                                                      _Prov._ XXIII., 5

A man to have friends must shew himself friendly.
                                                     _Prov._ XVIII., 24

Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing.
                                                     _Prov._ XVIII., 22

It is more blessed to give than to receive.
                                                         _Acts_ XX., 35

Perfect love casteth out fear.
                                                       _I John_ IV., 18

A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.
                                                       _Prov._ XXII., 1

The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.
                                                         _Mk._ XIV., 38

Comfort one another with these words.
                                                     _I Thess._ IV., 18

Of whom the world was not worthy.
                                                         _Heb._ XI., 38


                              SUPERLATIVE

                       Supreme            Highest

In an unrivaled degree

On a grand scale

Of profound significance

Beyond expression

On a world scale

In a rare degree

Of rarest beauty

In a notable way

In a conspicuous degree

On a grandiose scale

The weightiest factors in the whole matter is——

The supremest moments of life

Of the finest sort

The acme of——


                                  SURE

                      Certain            Positive

Demonstrated beyond all possibility of contradiction

As sure as God is sifting out the chaff

With mathematical certainty

That is one incontrovertible fact

In an unmistakable way

One conclusion is inescapable

An absolutely logical sequence of events

There is no wink of doubt about that——

By proof positive

To make assurance doubly sure

With unerring instinct

It leads to the inevitable conclusion that——

No doubt is possible that——

It is inevitable that——

Made us sure beyond a peradventure

Few events are better attested than——

They know to a dead certainty that——

It is safe to infer that——

Almost invariably

Unmistakable evidence

Conclusive evidence

Well-authenticated testimony

The conclusion cannot be escaped that——

A foregone conclusion.
                                                     _Othello_, III., 3

I speak from certainties.
                                                    _Coriolanus_, I., 2

Indisputably right

There is no gainsaying the fact that——

As certain as the multiplication table

We can rest absolutely assured that——

Beyond all dispute

The sure mark of a——

With entire certainty

It has the ring of finality in it


                               SUSPICION

                      Mistrust            Jealousy

A lurking suspicion all the while that——

A chronic distrust

An uncertain sense of something hidden

Timid misgivings

In such a way as to raise a mild suspicion that——

Inclined to be suspicious

Not the most distant suspicion of——

Tortured by suspicion

A suspicion born of the fact that——

I cannot help suspecting that——

I smell a device.
                                                _Twelfth Night_, II., 3

The insinuation has a foundation in fact

It is the fashion of unthinking persons to——


                                SYMBOLIC

                     Emblematic            Typical

Emblematic of the fact that——

The appearance for the thing

The form for the substance

The law for the essence

The sign for the thing signified

Of a figurative import


                                TACTLESS

                       Witless            Foolish

The knack of setting everything and everybody by the ears

There is need of a lady’s hand

It was not placatory but rather exasperating

Wholly indifferent to expediency

The intention was good but the method was wrong

Foolhardy

He is impossible

He is going over fool’s hill and is only part way over


                                 TERSE

                  Gratitude            Acknowledgment

In great recognition of——

Overflowing with gratitude

The will is taken for the deed

I am immensely indebted to you

I am under many obligations to you

It is very nice of you to——

I am grateful for your good opinion

I feel very grateful to you for your kindness

It was a memorable ride

I am deeply indebted to you

A debt of gratitude

Not the least of our mercies

What a blessing it is to be quit of——

I am not unmindful of——

I hope to return the compliment


                                TROUBLE

                       Trial            Adversity

A bad time of it

I have had some very trying days

In the full clutch of circumstance

As ill-luck would have it, I——

Tried in the crucible of sacrifice and suffering

It is a tragedy rather than an epic

In these turbulent days

An adverse wind blowing from an unexpected quarter

I have had an affecting business on my hands

A child of hard circumstances

Sorely vexed by——

I am in a very pretty pickle

I would gladly see an end to bickering

Swept with the besom of destruction

A troubled and precarious existence

Hard hit

A fact of great and sinister import

Bad news has wings

He must tread the wine-press alone

An ill-advised and unfortunate attempt to stir up strife

His heart as heavy as lead

A fountain of trouble

A series of heart-burnings

Turbulent times

The hour of misfortune

Acquainted with the painful problems of life

Painful vicissitudes

Tasting the bitterness of life


                                UNAWARE

                 Unconsciously            Thoughtlessly

All the while I was living in blissful ignorance of——

I was sweetly oblivious to the fact that——

In happy ignorance

Crass ignorance

He has plainly a lot to learn about——

The idea never occurred to them so far as any evidence goes to show

A model of blameless mediocrity

There is a dearth of knowledge about——

One half the world knows not how the other half lives


                                 UNITY

                       Concord            Harmony

It will not do to further exalt our differences

All indissolubly linked together

A unity of effort

Too many cooks spoil the broth

He that hunts two hares will catch neither

Everybody’s business is nobody’s business

A long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together

One and inseparable

Without the slightest friction

Pretty well in line with accustomed principles

Knit up with it

In perfect accordance with——

A happy blending of——

It is perfectly compatible with——

It is not until one has entered sympathetically into the conception
    of——

The result was a harmonious whole

We get on charmingly together

Into the scheme of things

Harmonious adjustment


                             UNSATISFACTORY

                   Unreliable            Undesirable

He fixed his faith on an idol with feet of clay

A weak reed to lean upon

Of a less desirable kind

He does not cut a very good figure

It does but scant justice to——

I cannot settle my spirits to it

Not altogether prepossessing

There is an element of danger in it

It was sown in weakness

Efforts which were mere flashes in the pan

Wide of the mark

A sign of pusillanimity and cowardice

Not content with——

Who shall decide when doctors disagree

The inadequacy of certain features of the——

A crude business

A certain coarseness of fiber

Out of kilter

It did not have the desired effect

A plea to throw into the discard every sacrifice

A case in which back-stairs gossip figures as sober truth

It will not pass muster

It has many shortcomings

The argument is not so convincing to the modern mind

Notoriously unreliable

Utterly ineffective

No more backbone than a jellyfish

With very unpleasant consequences

Yielding to a passing impulse

He is _persona non grata_ with——


                                 VAGUE

                       Hazy            Ambiguous

Extremely vague

Not apparent at first sight

In a shadowy form

A hazy sea of memories

He left us quite uncertain as to his meaning

His meaning was at low visibility

A very vague and perfectly unconvincing answer

Words whose ambiguity have been used to throw doubt upon——


                                 VALUE

                      Worth            Excellence

The salt of the earth

It has become a precious memory

An important adjunct

Indispensable qualities

Lasting acquisitions

Of inestimable value

Intrinsic worth

Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
                                          _III. King Henry VI._, II., 5

Of exceptional value

In every way calculated to insure the——

Decidedly worth while

Of high quality

Of unique and abiding value

A possession of transcendent value

Not measured by figures

Of the very first magnitude

Every man thinks his own copper gold

Whatever comes to his mill is grist

He is rich beyond all telling who——

It will be no inconsiderable acquisition to——

Of transcendent value

Than whom there could be no better

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush

He who prizes little things is worthy of great ones

Would you know what money is? Go borrow some

A thing too much seen is little prized

As valuable as a Brazilian diamond

It is supremely worth while

A mine of wealth in itself

Of unusual value

Not to be underestimated

A tremendous asset

With sterling qualities

He is a man of solid acquirements

The most precious of all blessings

It merits serious attention

Of exceptional qualifications

Of no common sort

Appraised highly

A superior brand of——


                               VALUELESS

                   Useless            Inconsequential

It cumbers the ground

Of no particular moment

Reduced to a nullity

What is of no use is too dear as a gift

Ammunition which does not explode

It serves no useful purpose

It vanished into thin air

Cheap and tawdry

Arid and unfruitful

An inconsequential detail

Of only relative and temporary worth

My day has been horribly dispersive

A mere dilettante

Utterly repudiated

A matter of secondary moment

Of small consequence

That proves next to nothing

Like a cipher

It is a matter of small consequence.
                                              _King Richard II._, V., 2

A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
                                           _I. King Henry IV._, III., 3

A deal of skimble-skamble stuff.
                                           _I. King Henry IV._, III., 1

It is idle to speculate on the outcome of——

It vanished like snow falling in the river

Unworthy of consideration

A dead issue

It matters not

It is immaterial

A seemingly inconsiderable circumstance

It is quite superfluous to——

Of no particular moment

It is idle to ask whether——

Of distinctly subordinate worth

Shrunk into insignificance

A petty matter of detail

Quite needless

Among the outworn things


                              VERIFICATION

                  Assurance            Authentication

Verified by all human experience

A fact obvious to any student of history

We have every assurance that——

We can disabuse our minds of the——

I would make assurance doubly sure

It may be safely asserted that——

Surely there can be no reasonable doubt that——

We can all be more patient in the assurance that——

The best possible testimony to the soundness of the method is that——

We are always ready to give an answer for the faith that is in us

There will not be the smallest impropriety in it

Men want to know beyond a doubt or cavil that——

It must be accompanied by irrevocable guarantees

From highly responsible sources assurances are given that——

We gave him every possible assurance

Make yourself perfectly easy about——

Pawn to me this your honor.
                                               _Timon of Athens_, I., 1


                                VEXATION

                   Impatience            Exasperation

A fit of nervous exasperation

Evidences of a reckless temper

An unpleasant passage of words

Impatient of delay

Exasperated beyond expression

Much piqued

Acting with the petulance of a child

Irritably self-conscious

Angry at the most minute provocation

Driven into nervous prostration

Thin-skinned in the presence of annoyances

Enough to imperil the habit of studied moderation of statement

The most exasperating of all nuisances

I was in the worst possible temper with——

Irritability that has some justification

I never before have known anything so provoking

He used most vigorous terms in referring to——

She hides all her vexation in her bosom

An error of the most exasperating sort

He is easily irritated

With the most astonishing perverseness

A weight of nerves without a mind

A few hot and bitter words

In utter exasperation

Petulant resentment

Sorely tired

A sore trial to his temper

It frets my soul to see——

A silly bit of petulance

A sulphurous state of mind

Exposed to petty tribulations

Exceedingly tantalizing

A suggestion of nervous tears

Very disconcerting

How uncomfortable is such an apprehension of——


                                 VIRILE

                    Clean-cut            Expressive

Ugly weather

A great mercy

The mildewed hand of famine

The loss of prestige

The famine of the heart

The terrors of uncertainty

A glory divine

A tinge of irony

Squirming over it

Atrophy of will-power

An ox-like stolidity

Back to prodigal ways

A lesson in moderation

Business capacity

Straining at the leash of——

Very acutely said

A coign of vantage

The horror of sin

A flattering tale

No waster of words

In the very pits of tragic life

The germinal ideal

The strategic opportunity

The dew of youth

The passion of hate

A law unto itself

The sequence of events

In a state of siege

A narcotic to the mind

A realizable aim


                                WARNING

                     Alarming            Awakening

We bless thee for all uplifting ministries

Unite us all by the bonds of tender sympathy

Thou hast done great things for us, whereof we are glad

In thy great love do thou nourish the hearts that are given over to
    sore trial

With thine own gentle hand dry the tears of sorrow

Heal with balm from heaven the wounded spirit

Our days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle

Thou only hast the keys of all power

Send sweet messages of hope and love to all for whom we ought to pray

Pity those who have no pity on themselves

Out of the fullness of thy grace send us answers that shall make us
    glad

Raise again every buried hope

Give life again to all our noblest ambitions

Behold what manner of love thou hast bestowed upon us that we should be
    called the sons of God

Thou art able to do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think

Be thou with our dear ones——building up their homes and blessing their
    firesides

Unite us in the indissoluble fellowship of sympathy with the heart of
    Christ

Do thou speak comfortably to anxious hearts

Our days are a continuance of thy favor

We are living to praise thee

Inspire every soul with unusual gladness

Comfort those that mourn, may they be richer for their tears

Grant unto us the tender solaces of thy gospel, the sweet comfort of
    thy grace

We would make mention of thy loving kindness

Until we take our place in the city whose hills are light

Enable us to meet with gentleness and forbearance any opposition to our
    wishes

And when we shall have fulfilled thy purposes concerning us on earth
    may we be received into the everlasting mansions revealed to us
    through Jesus Christ our Lord

Fortify us by thy spirit against the temptations that await us

May the sweet influences of the Gospel gladden and redeem many hearts

Rule thou in our hearts

Fill us with holy thoughts and noble desires

May we be warned of sin and its dreadful consequences

We thank thee for the rich promises and precious hopes of the Gospel of
    thy Son

We would breathe into thine ear our gratitude for mercies so free

May our hearts glow with a renewed sense of thy love

(Fulfill in us Thy gracious promises)

Help us to cherish the heavenly disposition of Jesus Christ our Lord

Scatter the darkness from our minds by the beam of thy heavenly truth

Teach us how to attain that holiness which will make us holy like thee

Clothe us with all social and domestic graces

Help us to discharge our debt to the world

Daily we would supplicate thy mercy and protection

Make our duties plain before us

May we be inflexible in every good purpose

Unseal our spiritual vision

We pray for those who are languishing on beds of sickness and have
    wearisome days and nights assigned them

We are sorry that we are so fondly attached to the things that perish

Encompass our minds this day with thoughts of heaven

Wilt thou take us unto thy keeping this day

Pity our frailties

Inspire us with an abiding gratitude

In the defenseless hours of sleep thou hast preserved us

With the light of another morning we would lift our hearts to thee in
    grateful acknowledgment of thy goodness

Suffer not our ears to become dull to the cry of misery

May no day pass without thy blessing

May our hearts be open to the glad tidings

Keep us from distrustful thoughts

Give us a cheerful and unfailing confidence that Thou art at the heart
    of affairs

May our trials be borne with Christian meekness

May our difficulties work out for us some spiritual good

Encourage us in every right endeavor

May the thought that thou seest us check every wrong motive and evil
    impulse

Give us calmness and self-control under every disappointment and
    provocation

Fill our hearts with thy rich grace

Soften our sorrows

Grant us thy reviving grace

Fill us with thy perfect love

Cheer saddened hearts

In our spirits sweetly move

Sanctify our deep distress

                         LETTERS OF CONDOLENCE

My dear ————,

I received to-day the sad word that ———— had passed away. I know that
your heart is sorely grieved, and I hasten to send to you this little
word of assurance of our love and sympathy. Trusting that you will
write as soon as you have the heart, for I am anxious to hear from you,
I am,

                                   With warmest regards,


My dear ————,

We were exceedingly sorry to learn of your bereavement. There are many
whom we have “loved and lost awhile.” But God will take us into their
goodly company some glad day. We unite in sending our sincere sympathy.

                                   With warm regards,


My dear ————,

We were so grieved to read in the paper of your great loss. Would
that we were not so far away from you, or else we would surely try to
comfort you with our presence.

Mrs. ———— and I send our best love and sympathy.

                                   Faithfully yours,


My dear ————,

We were very sorry to read of your bereavement in the loss of your
————. Our prayer is that you may find great consolation in the thought
that some day, in God’s own good time, you shall see ———— again.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

I was saddened to hear of your recent loss. I need not tell you how
often I think of you. With a prayer for every blessing upon you and
your family,

                                   Sincerely your friend,


My dear ————,

I regret exceedingly to hear of your sorrow. Do not try to explain to
yourself so trying an hour, but bring into requisition all the faith
and courage you can muster, and with confidence face the seeming dismal
days.

Lean hard upon your good friends,

                                   One of whom is


My dear ————,

We have heard with deep feelings of regret of the death, of your ————,
and we offer you our most sincere sympathy in your great loss.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

Please accept condolences and sincere sympathy for the loss of my
friend ————.

                                   Your Friend,


My dear ————,

Mrs. ———— shares with me the great sorrow which so many feel on account
of the death of your ————.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

I am deeply grieved by the news of your bereavement, and beg you to
accept the expression of my profound and heartfelt sympathy.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

I am greatly grieved to hear of the death of ———— for whom I had the
utmost regard. Please accept my deepest sympathy.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

My heartfelt sympathy goes out to you in your bereavement.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

We send our love and our tenderest sympathy.

                                   Sincerely,


My dear ————,

We are greatly afflicted by the melancholy intelligence which has
reached us that ———— is no more with us. He carried the riches of God
within himself, and was a royal-hearted man. He was greatly beloved by
all of us. With a prayer for every blessing on yourself,

                                   Affectionately your friend,


My dear ————,

Permit me to express on behalf of ———— and myself our deepest sympathy.
May you find very great comfort in the thought that there is a time
coming when there shall be no more death, neither sorrow.

                                   Faithfully yours,


My dear ————,

I know not how to express my sorrow at the word which I have just
received. Your ———— was such a sweet uncomplaining spirit. We shall
miss ———— when next we come to ————.

I should be glad if I could suggest anything to lighten the burden, and
make your path a little more smooth and easy.

                                   Sincerely your friend,


My dear ————,

I know that your heart must be sorely grieved at the loss of your
splendid ————. ———— knew the secret of beautiful living. We can console
ourselves with the assurance that we shall some day see our loved ones
in the brighter happier world above.

                                   Sincerely your friend,


My dear Friend,

It is with great regret that we learn of the sad occurrence at your
home. Please accept our united and sincere condolences.

                                   With deepest sympathy,


My dear ————,

Words are inadequate to express my feelings at this hour. Exceeding
great sympathy,


My dear ————,

We were exceedingly sorry to read of the death of your good ————. I
wish I could suggest something to make your paths a little more smooth
and easy. Perhaps the words “He knoweth” will be of comfort.

We unite in sending our affectionate regards to all.

                                   Most sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

Let me send a little word of encouragement and sympathy in this dark
hour of your life. And perhaps the best word is that which says: “For
we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we
have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.” Mrs. ———— and I offer you our most sincere sympathy. Let us
have the comfort of hearing from you soon.

                                   Faithfully yours,


My dear ————,

No words can quite express my sympathy in this time of deep sorrow. As
long as I shall remember anything I shall remember ———— virtues and ————
kindnesses.

                                   Your Friend,


My dear ————,

I can imagine your heart must be sorely grieved in your recent loss. We
beg you to accept our love and sympathy.

                                   Sincerely your friend,


My dear ————,

May every consolation and blessing be granted to you in your deep
sorrow. Kindly accept my heartfelt sympathy.

                                   Sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

May I share with you the deep sorrow you are called upon to bear at the
loss of your ————. So many beautiful traits made up ———— character. Be
greatly comforted by the assurance which He gives to us that we shall
see our Lord again, for He says: “Because I live, ye shall live also.”

                                   Most sincerely yours,


My dear ————,

I hope I need not tell you how anxious I have been since I first heard
of your great loss. You have my earnest prayers that the Almighty may
support you.

                                   Your Friend,


My dear ————,

I was grieved to hear of your recent sorrow. Please accept for yourself
my assurance of deep sympathy.

My dear ————,

How I regretted to hear of your late bereavement. Trusting that the
dark cloud of sorrow will also have for you a bright side of hope, I
am,

                                   Your Friend,


My dear ————,

I took a nice little fancy to you in our dealings at ————, and hence,
when I read this morning of the death of your ————, I was truly sorry.
On the day that I talked last with him, I was much impressed with his
vigor both of body and of mind. I would be glad to have had such a
————.

May you be greatly comforted by the affection and esteem in which ————
was held by ———— many friends.

                                   With sincere regards,


My dear ————,

It was with the deepest regret that we learned of your loss. What a
comfort it must be to you that you were able to be with him during his
illness. Please accept my most sincere sympathy.

heartfelt sympathy in your bereavement.

                                   Most sincerely,


My dear ————,

I sympathize keenly with you in the loss of your ————. May the Father
of mercies give you the rich consolation of his grace. Do not fear for
he knows what is in your heart.

                                   Your Friend,


My dear ————,

Such a sad circumstance has come to you. I would that I might express
my sympathy to you in person. In your hour of trial may God comfort you
greatly.

                                   Yours sincerely,


My dear ————,

We extend our heartfelt sympathy in your hour of trial.

                                   Sincerely yours,

                                   Your Friend,


My dear ————,

How can I express my sympathy for you in the loss of your dear mother.
When one loses her mother she feels she has lost her best friend, and
can only wait for time to heal the heartache. With assurance of love,

                                   Very sincerely yours,

My dear ————,

I am sincerely sorry to hear of your loss. You, who have so often
comforted others, are now to be comforted. And what better word can I
send to you than that which Paul writes in the Second Epistle to the
Corinthians: “Blessed be God, even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us
in all our tribulations that we may be able to comfort them which are
in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of
God. For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ.”

We offer our sincere sympathy in your great sorrow.

                                   Most faithfully yours,


                    (For Member of an Organization)

                         (On Death of Soldier)

My dear ————,

May I express to you my sincere condolence in your hour of sorrow. I
have just learned that your son gave his life, though not in battle,
still in his and our Country’s cause. We are all proud of him, and I
sincerely hope that you will find much comfort in the knowledge of the
affection in which he is held.

                                   With sincerest sympathy,


                      (When Interment is at Home)

My dear ————,

We have just been informed that your son’s body has been lovingly laid
to rest at home. If ever we were proud of our soldier boys it is now.
Every day their sacrifices are more precious to us as we dwell upon
their likeness to the greatest of all sacrifices which God made for us
through his Son.

May the God of all comfort, comfort you and yours is our prayer.

                                   Sincerely yours,


                         (Interment of Soldier)

My dear ————,

I am thinking of you to-day in all your sorrow, yet knowing that you
are comforted. Comforted by the assurance that your son died as a
true soldier, giving his all at its best for you and for his country;
comforted by the fact that you have him near you again, where you can
go occasionally in sweet reverence and recall precious memories. Above
all you must be comforted by the Redeemer’s resurrection promise that
you shall see your dear son again.

Please accept my heartfelt sympathy.

                                   Your Friend,
