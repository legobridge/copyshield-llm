TO THE

Courteous Reader.


_Reader,_

Before thou goest on further to the perusing of this Work, thou art
humbly intreated by the Authour, to forgive him his Anglicisme; for being
born a Forreigner, and having had no body to help him to the polishing
of it, for several reasons, it cannot be expected he should please thine
Ears, so much as he may perhaps do thy Fancy. Every Exotick Plant can
hardly become Domestical under one or two Generations: Besides that,
the Crabbedness of the Original in his own Idiome, can scarce admit a
Polite Eloquency in another. The very Antient _English_ Language in this
refined Age, is become both obsolete and unintelligible, as we may see in
_Chaucer_, _Gower_, and others. If you adde to this, that the Authours
Nation hath been alwayes famous for its Civility to those that were
Strangers to their Language, as not onely to abstain from laughing at
them when they spoke amiss, but also in redressing them charitably to the
best of their power. I may probably expect you will measure me with the
same measure, as you would be if you were in my case.

As for the Errataes of the Press, I could not help them, being out of
Town most part of the time that the Book was a Printing; when you meet
with any, I hope your Charitable Pen will either mend or obliterate
them, and not lay another mans fault upon me, who neither for pride nor
ostentation undertook this laborious Work, but that I might give some
Satisfaction and Recreation to the Learned and Curious, who have had a
longing for it ever since its Birth.

                                                               _Farewell._

THE

PREFACE

TO THE

READER.


_READER_,

Before I speak any thing of the Author, or of his Works, I think it
convenient to speak somthing of my self, and of my intention in setting
out this Translation, with my Annotations.

The Reputation that this Book hath amongst all the _Europeans_, since its
first coming out, which was in the year 1555. and the curiosity that from
time to time the learned have had to see the Mysteries contained in it,
unfolded: is a sufficient warrant for my undertaking.

Many better Pens (I confess) could have performed this work with better
success, but not with greater facility than I, having from my youth been
conversant with those that pretended or endeavered to know somthing in
it. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for a man of my profession
to wade through it. This Book was the first after my Primmer, wherein
I did learn to read, it being then the Custom in _France_, about the
year 1618. to initiate Children by that Book; First, because of the
crabbidness of the words; Secondly, that they might be acquainted with
the old and absolete _French_, such as is now used in the _English_ Law;
and Thirdly, for the delightfulness and variety of the matter, so that
this Book in those days was printed every year like an Almanack, or a
Primer for Children. From that time, without any other Study than reading
of History, and observing the events of the world, and conversing with
those that made it their Study, (some of which were like to run mad about
it) I have attained to so much Knowledge, as to bring it into a Volume.

The Book is written in the Nature of Prophecies, digested into old
_French_ Verses, most of which are very hard to be understood, and others
impossible at all, whether the Author did affect obscurity, or else
wanted the faculty to express himself, which is the cause that it could
not be rendred into _English_ Verses, it being troublesome enough to be
understood in Prose, as the Reader will find. That’s the reason that I
have translated it almost word for word, to make it as plain as I could;
as also because the Reader (if curious of it) may benefit himself in the
knowledge of the _French_ Tongue, by comparing the _English_ and _French_
together. The rest that can be said upon this subject, you shall find
either in the Authors Life, or in the Appology made for him.

And because I have told you before, that many have been like to run mad
by over-studying these, and other Prophecies, give me leave to give you
this advice, that in vain, or at least without any great profit, thou
shalt bestow thy time, care, and study upon it: for which I will give
thee the chief reasons, that have disswaded me from it.

The first is, that the thing it self, which you may think to understand,
is not certain in it self; because the Author disguiseth it in several
manners, sometimes speaking a double sense, as that of the ancient Oracle.

    _Aio te Æacida Romanos vincere posse._

Which is to be understood two ways, and cannot be determinated, till the
event of it be past.

It is true, that the Author doth mark so many particular Circumstances,
that when the thing is come to pass, every one may clearly see that
he pretended to Prophecie that particular thing. And besides he doth
sometimes deliver the thing in so obscure terms, that without a peculiar
_Genius_, it is almost impossible to understand it.

The second is, that though the Prophecie be true in it self, yet no body
knoweth, neither the time, nor how: For example, he plainly foretelleth,
that the Parliament of _England_ should put their King to death;
nevertheless no body could tell, nor when, nor how, till the thing was
come to pass, nor what King it should be, till we had seen it.

The third is, that he marketh the times with Astrological terms, _viz._
when such and such Planets, shall be in such and such Signs; but as
those Planets are often here, and go out of it, and come there again, no
certain judgement can be made of it.

The fourth is, that many times he giveth some peculiar Circumstances to
those he speaketh of, which may be found in others. Thus _the Royal first
born_ might have been applied to _Lewis_ the XIII. to _Lewis_ the XIV. to
the first born of _Philip_ the II. and _Philip_ the III. King of _Spain_,
and to Kings of _England_, Father and Son. Nevertheless we find that this
word _Royal first born_, was intended for _Henry_ IV. Grandfather on his
Mothers side, as we shall shew hereafter. This being so, it cannot be
expounded, but after the event.

The fifth is, that the knowledge of future things, belongeth to
God alone, and no body can pretend by any study, to have a certain
acquisition of it in all its Circumstances.

The sixth is, that the orders of Gods providence, which cause the several
events in all States, will not permit that men should have a publick
notion of his designs, sometimes he revealeth them to his Servants, or to
some particular man as he pleaseth, but he will not have them to be known
among the common sort of men.

The seventh, is the experience we have had of many, who pretending
to understand the Author, have made a quantity of false Prophecies,
expounding the Stanza’s according to their fancy, as if God had given
them the same understanding that he gave the Author, and what ought
to confirm us more in this point, is, that they have expounded some
Prophecies, as if they were to come to pass, which were past already, by
which we see the darkness of humane wit, who without authority pretendeth
to bite into the forbidden fruit of knowledge.

The eighth is, that this knowledge is no way profitable for the Vulgar;
because those things being decreed by God, they shall come to pass
without forceing our liberty, nor hindering the contingency of sublunary
things, where we must observe that the Prophecies which were revealed to
men, are many times conditional, as we see in that of _Jonas_ against
_Ninive_, but those that they have left in writing for the times that
should come after them, are absolutely true, and shall infallibly come
to pass, as they have foretold them. This no ways hindereth, but God may
reveal some secrets of his to private men, for their benefit, and that
of their friends, without imparting it to the Vulgar, who may be, should
laugh at them.

The ninth is, that God hath peculiarly reserved to himself the knowledge
of times. _Daniel_, by a special favour, knew the end of the _Babylonian_
Captivity, and the time of the _Messiah_’s birth, and yet the
interpreters can scarce yet expound clearly the meaning of the seventy
weeks of _Daniel_, and we see, that since 1600 years ago, holy men, from
age to age, have foretold the proximity of Dooms-day, and the coming of
Antichrist.

The tenth is, that the foretelling of future things in this Author, is
for the most part included in business of State, and one might be guilty
of a criminal temerity, if he would discover things that concern us not,
and the concealing of which, is commended by all prudent persons, seeing
that we owe respect, love, and submission to those that bear rule over us.

For these reasons (dear Reader) I would not have thee intangle thy self
in the pretentions of knowing future things. If you have light concerning
them, keep thine own secret, and make use of it for thy self: Preserve
peace, and let the Almighty govern the World: for he can turn all things
to his Glory, and may when he pleaseth, raise up some Wits that will make
known unto us, what we desire, without any further trouble to our selves.
Before I make an end, I cannot but acquaint thee for gratitude sake, of
my Obligation to several persons, which have lent me Books, to help me
towards the finishing of this work, as namely that worthy Gentleman, and
the Honour of his profession Mr. _Francis Bernard_, Apothecary to St.
_Bartholemews_ Hospital, and Mr. _Philip Auberton_ Gentleman, belonging
to the Right Honourable the Earl of _Bridgwater_. Farewell.




THE

LIFE

OF

Michael Nostradamus,

Physitian in Ordinary to HENRY the II. and CHARLES the IX. Kings of
_France_.


_Michael Nostradamus_, the most renowned and famous Astrologer, that hath
been these many Ages, was born in St. _Remy_, a Town of _Provence_, in
the year 1503. upon a _Thursday_, the 14th of _December_, about noon.
His father was _James Nostradamus_, a Notary of the said Town, his
Mother was _Renata_ of St. _Remy_, whose Grandfathers by the Fathers and
Mothers side, were men very skilfull, in Mathematick and Physick, one
having been Physitian to _Renatus_, King of _Jerusalem_, and _Sicily_,
and Earl of _Provence_, and the other Physition to _John_, Duke of
_Calabria_, Son to the said _Renatus_, whence cometh that our Author
saith in his Commentaries, that he hath received from hand to hand the
Knowledge of Mathematicks, from his ancient Progenitors. After the death
of his great Grandfather by the Mothers side, who first gave him a
slight tincture, and made him in love with the Mathematicks, he was sent
to School to _Avignon_. After that he went to Mount _Pelier_, to study
Philosophy and Physick, till a great Plague coming, he was compelled to
go to _Narbonne_, _Thoulouse_, and _Bourdeaux_, where he first began
to practise, being then about 22 years of age. Having lived four years
in those parts, he went back again to _Monpelier_, to get his degrees,
which he did with a great deal of applause. Going to _Thoulouse_, he
past through _Agen_, where _Julius Cæsar Scaliger_ stayed him, with
whom he was very familiar and intimately acquainted, though they fell
out afterward; there he took to wife a very honourable Gentlewoman, by
whom he had two Children, a Son and a Daughter, all which being dead,
and seeing himself alone, he resolved to retire himself into _Provence_
his Native Countrey. After he had gone to _Marseille_, he went to _Aix_,
where the Parliament of _Provence_ sitteth, and was there kept three
years at the City Charges; because of the violent Plague that raged then
in the year 1546. as you may read in the Lord of _Launay_’s Book, called
the Theater of the World, who describeth that Plague according to the
informations our Author gave him. Thence he went to _Salon de Craux_, a
City distant from _Aix_ one dayes Journey, and in the middle way between
_Avignon_ and _Marseille_; there he Married his second Wife _Anna Ponce
Genelle_, by whom he had three Sons and one Daughter, the eldest was
_Michael Nostradamus_, who hath written some pieces of Astrology, Printed
at _Paris_ in the year 1563.

The second was _Cæsar Nostradamus_, who hath deserved to be numbred among
the _French_ Historians, by reason of the great Volume he hath written of
_Provence_.

The third was a Capuchine Frier. _Cæsar_ did insert in his History the
propagation of that Order in _Provence_. The fourth was a Daughter.

_Nostradamus_ having found by experience that the perfect knowledge of
Physick dependeth from that of Astrology, he addicted himself to it, and
as this Science wanteth no allurement, and that besides his Genius he had
a peculiar disposition and inclination to it; he made such a progress
in it, that he hath deserved the Title of the most illustrious one in
_France_, insomuch that making some Almanacks for recreation sake, he did
so admirably hit the conjuncture of events, that he was sought for far
and near.

This success was the cause of an extraordinary diminution of his fame;
for the Printers and Booksellers seeing his fame, did print and vent
abundance of false Almanacks under his name for lucre sake, whence it
came that his reputation suffered by it, and was the cause that the Lord
_Pavillon_ wrote against him, and that the Poet _Jodele_ made this bitter
Distichon.

    _~Nostra damus~ cum falsa damus, nam fallere nostrum est,_
      _Et cum falsa damus, nil nisi ~Nostra damus~._

To which may be answered.

    _~Nostra damus~ cum verba damus quæ ~Nostradamus~ dat,_
      _Nam quæcunque dedit nil nisi vera dedit._

Or thus

    _Vera damus cum verba damus quæ ~Nostradamus~ dat,_
      _Sed cum ~Nostra damus~, nil nisi falsa damus._

Nevertheless the Beams of Truth did shine through the Clouds of Calumny;
for he was singularly esteemed of by the Grandees, Queen _Katharine_ of
_Medicis_, who had a natural inclination to know future things.

And _Henry_ the II. King of _France_, who sent for him to come to the
Court in the year 1556. and having had private conference with him about
things of great concernment, sent him honourably back again with many
gifts. He went from _Salon_ to the Court upon the 14 of _July_ in the
year 1555. and came to _Paris_ upon the 15 of _August_. As soon as he
was come to Town, the Lord Constable of _Montmorency_ went to see him
at his Inn, and presented him to the King, who received him with much
satisfaction, and commanded that his lodging should be at the Palace of
the Cardinal of _Bourbon_ Archbishop of _Sens_.

There he was taken with the Gout for ten or twelve days, after which
his Majesty sent him one hundred Crowns in Gold in a Velvet Purse, and
the Queen as much. Their Majesties desired him to go to _Blois_ to see
the Princes their Children, and to tell them his opinion of them. It
is certain that he did not tell them what he thought, considering the
Tragical end of those three Princes, _viz._ _Francis_ the II. _Charles_
the IX. and _Henry_ the III.

Having been so much honoured at Court, he went back again to _Salon_,
where he made an end of his last Centuries, two years after he dedicated
them to the King _Henry_ the II. in the year 1557. and in his Luminary
Epistle discovereth unto him the future events that shall happen from the
Birth of _Lewis_ the XIV. now Reigning, till the coming of Antichrist.

While he was at _Salon_ he received there the Duke of _Savoy_, and
the Lady _Margaret_ of _France_, Sister to _Henry_ the II. who was to
Marry the said Duke according to the treaty of the general Peace made
at _Cambresis_, both entertained him very familiarly, and honoured him
often with their presence. The Duke came in _October_ and the Lady in
_December_.

When _Charles_ the IX. went a progress through his Kingdom, he came into
_Provence_, and did fail not to go to _Salon_ to visit our Author, who in
the name of the Town went to salute him, and make a Speech, this was in
the year 1564. the 17 of _November_.

The extraordinary satisfaction that the King and the Queen Mother
received from him was such, that being both at _Lion_, they sent for him
again, and the King gave him 200 Crowns in Gold, and the Queen almost as
much, with the quality of Physician in Ordinary to the King, with the
Salaries and profits thereunto appertaining. Being come back to _Salon_
he lived about 16 Months longer, and died upon the 2 of _July_ 1566.
in his Climacterical year of 63. having all his senses about him: His
Disease was a Gout at first, which turned into a Dropsie; the time of
his death it seemeth was known to him; for a friend of his witnesseth,
that at the end of _June_ in the said year he had writen with his own
hand upon the Ephemerides of _John Stavius_ these Latine words, _Hic
prope mors est_; that is, near here is my death, and the day before his
death that friend of his having waited on him till very late took his
leave, saying, I shall see you again to morrow morning, you shall not
see me alive when the Sun riseth, which proved true. He died a _Roman_
Catholick, having received all his Sacraments, and was solemnly buried in
the Church of the _Franciscan_ Friers at _Salon_, on the left hand of the
Church door, where his Widow erected him a Marble Table fastened in the
Wall with this Epitaph, with his Figure to the Life, and his Arms above
it.

    The Inscription of his EPITAPH is in imitation of that of
    _Titus Livius_, and is thus.

                                _D. M._

    _Ossa clarissimi ~Michaelis Nostradami~, unius omnium pene
    mortalium digni, cujus Divino calamo totius Orbis ex astrorum
    influxu futuri eventus conscriberentur. Vixit annos ~LXII.~
    menses ~VI.~ dies ~X.~ Obiit. Salonæ ~CIↃ IↃLXVI~. ~Anna Pontia
    Gemella~, conjugi optimo. ~V. E.~_

Which may be rendred thus:

    Here lies the Bones of the most famous _Nostradamus_, one who
    among Men hath deserved by the opinion of all, to set down in
    writting with a Quill almost Divine, the future Events of all
    the Universe, caused by the Cœlestial influences; he lived 62.
    years 6. Months and 10. days, he died at _Salon_, in the year
    1566.

               O Posterity do not grudge at his rest.

    _Anna Pontia Gemella_ wisheth to her most loving Husband the
    true Happiness.

He had a Brother named _John Nostradamus_, famous for several Works that
he hath written, the Catalogue of which is in the Book of Mr. _du Maine
de la Croix_, Intitled, the _Library_.

As for our Author, he hath left several Works, among which is a Book of
Receits, for the preservation of health, Printed at _Poitiers_, in the
year 1556.

Another concerning the means of beautifying the Face and the Body,
that was Printed at _Antwerp_ by _Plantin_ in the year 1557. which
he Dedicated to his Brother _John Nostradamus_, an Attorney at the
Parliament of _Aix_.

Besides this, he Translated from Latine into French the _Paraphases of
Galen_, upon the Exhortation of _Menedotus_, which was Printed at _Lyon_
by _Antony du Rhosne_, in the year 1557.

But before we conclude, it will not be amiss to give some recreation to
the Reader, by relating a merry passage that happened to _Nostradamus_
being in _Lorrain_, for being in the Castle of _Faim_, belonging to the
Lord of _Florinville_, and having in cure the Mother of the said Lord; it
chanced one day that they both walking in the Yard, there was two little
Piggs, one white, and the other black, whereupon the Lord enquired of
_Nostradamus_ in jest, what should become of these two Piggs? he answered
presently, we shall eat the black, and the Wolf shall eat the white.

The Lord _Florinville_ intending to make him a Lyar, did secretly command
the Cook to dress the white for Supper; the Cook then killed the white,
drest it, and spitted it ready to be rosted when it should be time; In
the mean time having some business out of the Kitchin, a young tame Wolf
came in, and eat up the Buttocks of the white Pig, that was ready to be
rosted; the Cook coming in the mean time, and fearing least his Master
should be angry, took the black one, killed it, and drest it, and offered
it at Supper. Then the Lord thinking he had got the Victory, not knowing
what was befallen, said to _Nostradamus_, well Sir, we are eating now the
white Pigg, and the Wolf shall not touch it. I do not believe it (said
_Nostradamus_) it is the black one that is upon the Table. Presently the
Cook was sent for, who confessed the accident, the relation of which was
as pleasing to them as any meat.

In the same Castle of _Faim_, he told many that in a little Hill that
was near the Castle, there was a Treasure hidden, which should never be
found, if it were sought with design, but that it should be discovered
when the Hill should be digged for some other intent. There is a great
probability in this prediction, for there was an ancient Temple built
upon it, and when they dig there, many times several Antiquities are
found. All _France_ telleth several Histories foretold by the Author, but
I am unwilling to write any thing without good warrant. His Stanza’s are
sufficient to prove the extraordinary Talent he had in foretelling future
things.




APOLOGY

FOR

Michael Nostradamus.




CHAP. I.


It is not unusual for Calumny to follow the best Wits, and those whom God
hath endowed with so extraordinary Talent, upon weak and slight grounds.
It is not also unusual for Men to side easier with calumny against
innocent persons, then with those truths that justifie them; therefore
no body ought to wonder, if _Michael Nostradamus_ hath been so much
cried down and defamed by several Authors, being in the number of those
extraordinary persons, whom God had priviledged with that grace so much
desired by curious Men, _viz._ the knowledge of future events.

Besides that, there was four things in him, which might have been the
grounds of this diffamation.

The first was the vulgar life which he led in the Roman Catholik
Religion, which seemed to bear no proportion with such an extraordinary
favour of God.

The second was his application to judicial Astrology, which is condemned
by many learned Men, and detested by those that pretend to ignorant
devotion.

The third was a suspition brought by his enemies, and many devout persons
in his time, that he was a Negromancer, and had familiarity with the
Angel of darkness.

The fourth was the obscurity of his Stanza’s, which was made worse by the
enormous faults of those that first Copied them, and by the carelesness
of the Printers.




CHAP. II.

_How the first Objection hath caused the Author to be reputed a false
Prophet._


In consequence of the first Objection, calumny hath endeavoured to place
him among the false Prophets, because scarce any body can persuade
himself, that there being among the Faithful so many Illustrious persons
in Holiness and Learning, the Holy Ghost would have made choice of a
common person, and to reveal him so many rare secrets, concerning the
future Estate of his Church, and of those Kingdoms that acknowledge
her for their Mother, seeing that the Holy Scriptures shew us, that
the knowledge of future things (chiefly if it be extraordinary in its
extent) is a special Priviledge wherewith God honoureth his most faithful
Servants.

And to say truth, when the Holy Fathers and the Interpreters of the
Scripture speak of the Prerogatives of the Apostle St. _John_, they make
the chiefest to be that by which being full of Prophetical Spirit, he
foretold the future Estate of the Church; and in the Old Testament, so
many Prophets were so many Miracles and Prodigies of Holiness, and the
only name of Prophet in the Scripture is the most glorious Title that is
given to those that were Gods most faithful Servants.

If we find in the Scripture that _Balaam_ hath Prophesied notwithstanding
his perfidiousness, and that the High Priest _Caiaphas_, notwithstanding
his wicked design of murdering Christ, hath also Prophesied; it was only
for a few things, and in such cases where God would singularly shew forth
his Glory, by those that would have smothered it.

How can we then believe the same of _Nostradamus_, who had not so much as
an extraordinary atom of Christian piety, by which he might have been so
much priviledg’d of God, as to know by his Divine Light the future Estate
of the Church, her Persecutions and her Victories from the year 1555. to
the end of the World.

Can it be possible that a Physician, an Astrologer, and one of the common
sort of people should have been chosen of God among so many thousands his
betters, to impart unto him those Graces, which have been the reward of
the purity and holiness of his Apostles, and of the faithfulness of St.
_John_ the Evangelist.

This seemeth altogether improbable to Christian piety.




CHAP. III.

_The second Objection hath ranked the Author among Dreamers and false
Visionaries._


Some are more moderate in the censuring of this Author, and being
unwilling to call him maliciously a false Prophet, would have him to be a
foolish Dreamer, who believed his own imaginations, and took pleasure in
his own fancies, whence came that Latine Distick of the Poet _Jodelle_,

    _~Nostra damus~ cum falsa damus, nam fallere nostrum est,_
    _Et cum falsa damus, nil nisi ~Nostra damus~._

This Distick was so pleasing to the Wits of the times, that without
further inquiry, since that time _Nostradamus_ went for a Dreamer and a
doting fool.

This opinion increased more and more by his making of many Almanacks,
wherein every body may see how much he was taken with judicial Astrology;
and we see often in his Stanza’s the decision of the times, by the
conjunction of the Planets with the Signs, and by the Eclipses, whence
sometimes he doth infer some events that were to happen.

But what did undo him most, was the covetousness of the Printers and
Booksellers of his time, who seeing his Almanacks so well received, did
set forth a thousand others under his name, that were full of lies and
fopperies.

From that time the Author went for one of those poor Astrologers, who
get their living by foretelling absurdities; and pretend to read in the
Heavens, that which is only in their foolish imagination.




CHAP. IV.

_The third Objection accuseth the Author of medling with the black Art,
of being a Negromancer, and a Disciple of the Devil._


If the precedents have been moderate in their censure; others have been
more severe in delivering their opinion, accusing him to have kept
acquaintance with the Devil, as the Negromancers and other Prestigiators
of the ancient times did.

The reason that made them think so is, that seeing so many things come
to pass, just as the Author had foretold; they could not attribute it
to the knowledge of judicial Astrology, nor to Divine Revelation, and
consequently concluded, that it must of necessity come from Satan.

They could not attribute it to judicial Astrology, either because they
had no opinion of it, or that the greatest defensors of that Astrology
do agree among themselves, that it cannot reach so far as to foretell a
thousand peculiar circumstances, which depend purely from the freedom
of Men, such as proper names are, and the like, which nevertheless our
Author did foretell.

They could neither attribute it to Divine Revelation, for the reasons
alledged in the first objection; moreover, because he was accused of a
thousand falsities and fopperies, Printed in those Almanacks that went
falsly under his name, whence they concluded that it could not come by
Divine Revelation, seeing that the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Truth.

It followeth then (say they) that it must come from the Devil, by
the help of the Black Art; the Lord _Florimond de Raimond_ a very
considerable Author, was of that opinion in his Book of the _Birth of
Heresies_, Chap. 3.




CHAP. V.

_The fourth Objection maketh him the Head of those Seductors and
Impostors, which are dangerous in a Common-wealth._


As Fame doth increase by continuation of time, so doth calumny increase
by the multiplicity of opinions, she was not contented to deflour
slightly the Authors reputation, by making him pass for some sottish
Dreamer, and to rank him amongst the false Prophets, by accusing him
to meddle with the black Art, but must needs also sacrifice him to the
infernal Furies, by making him the Prince of Seductors and Impostors,
that ought to be banished out of every Common-wealth. The fondamental
reason of this was the obscurity of his Stanza’s, where there was neither
rime nor reason; the obscurity did proceed of abundance of gross faults,
which the Copisters and Printers have inserted in them, from the omission
of several words, from the changing and altering of others, and from the
addition of some others, which did destroy the sense.

From this great obscurity, calumny draweth this argument, to ruine
utterly the Author, charging him to be all at once a false Prophet, a
dotish Dreamer, a Magician, and an infamous Seductor of people.

If God had inspired him what he hath written, he would have done it for
the good of his Church and true Believers, seeing he never granteth this
Prophetical Grace to any, but to that end as it appeareth in the Holy
Scriptures.

This being so, what profit can any body draw from him, if the sense of
his Stanza’s be so obscure, as not to be understood? and although it
should be granted, that some accidents that have happened in Christendom,
may sometimes be found in his Prophecies, what fruit hath the Church
reaped of it, seeing that those accidents that were foretold, were never
known, till they had come to pass, and that there was no avoiding of them?

It cannot therefore be believed, that God should have been the Author of
his Predictions, but rather the Subtle Spirit of Satan, with whom he was
acquainted by such like black Arts.

According to those four Objections, the Lord _Sponde_ in the third Volume
of his _Annals_, made him this Epitaph in the year 1566. _Mortuus est hoc
anno nugax ille toto orbe famosus ~Michael Nostradamus~, qui se præscium
& præsagum eventuum futurorum per astrorum influxum venditavit, sub cujus
deinceps nomine quivis homines ingeniosi suas hujusmodi cogitationes
protendere consueveruent, in quem valde apposite lusit qui dixit.
~Nostra damus~ cum falsa damus_, &c. In _English_. In the year 1566. died
that Trifler so famous through all the World, _Michael Nostradamus_
who boasted while he lived, to know and foretell future things, by the
knowledge he had of the influences of the Planets, under whose name
afterwards many ingenious Men have vented their Imaginations, insomuch,
that he that made that Distick, Nostra damus _cum falsa damus_, &c.
seemeth to have very well said.




CHAP. VI.

_Proofs setting forth evidently that ~Nostradamus~ was enlightned by the
Holy Ghost._


In consequence of these objections forged by calumny, _Nostradamus_ name
hath been so cried down, that I have thought me self oblidged to make
his Apology, to give the greater credit to his Prophecy, the exposition
of which I do here undertake, and to proove, that effectually he was
enlightned by the Holy Ghost: first, by writting the History of his Life,
as I have done in the beginning of this Book; Secondly, by answering to
all the said Objections; Thirdly, by alledging the Elogies given him by
several Grave and Authentical Authors.

First, I maintain that he was enlightned by the Holy Ghost, by an
unanswerable reason, drawn out the Theology, but before we discourse of
it, let us suppose that _Nostradamus_ hath foretold many things, which
absolutely depends from the free will of men, and cannot be known,
neither by judicial Astrology, nor by Satan himself, such are for exemple
the proper names of Persons, which nevertheless he doth in his Prophecies.

He nameth the Lord of _Monluc_, the Sprightful _Gascon_, the Captain
_Charry_, his Camerade, the Lord _de la Mole_, Admiral of _Henry_ the
II. Galleys, _Entragues_, who was beheaded by order of _Lewis_ the XIII.
the Headsman of the Duke of _Montmorency_, named _Clerepegne_; the Bassa
_Sinan_, destroyer of _Hungary_; the Murderer of _Henry_ the III. named
_Clement_; the Attorney _David_, the Captain _Ampus_; the Mayor of the
City of _Puy_ in _Gelay_, named _Rousseau_, under Henry the IV. _Lewis_
Prince of _Condé_, under _Francis_ II. _Sixtus_ V. calling him the Son
of _Hamont_; _Gabrielle d’Estrée_; the Lord _Mutonis_ sent to _Paris_ by
those of _Aix_, under _Charles_ the IX. the Lord Chancellor of _France_,
named _Antony de Sourdis_; the Queen _Leuise_: _Antony_ of _Portugal_:
the Governour of _Cazal_ under _Henry_ II.

Secondly, The number of things is of the same nature: _Nostradamus_ doth
often calculate it; he reckoneth fourteen Confederates for the service of
_Henry_ IV. in the City of _Puy_: ten great Ships prosecuting extreamly
the Admiral in the Battle of _Lepanto_: five Ships taken from the
_Spaniard_ by those of _Diepe_, under _Henry_ II. nine hundred thousands
_Mores_ that went out of _Spain_ under _Henry_ IV. three hundred and
fifty thousands killed under _Charles_ IX. and _Henry_ III. three saved
at the taking of a Town in _Hungary_ by the _Turks_: nine separated from
the company of Seditious, that were to be put to death, three Princes
of _Turky_ Massacred, and the fourth being the youngest saved; thirty
Conspirators upon _London_ Bridge, against the Majesty of King _Charles_
I. and such like.

Thirdly, We find in these Prophecies, the Prodigies that have no other
causes in nature, then the meer will of God; such as Comets are, the
casting of monstrous Fishes by the Sea upon the Land, the Armies in the
Air, the speaking of Dogs, the birth of Monsters, and such like.

Fourthly, We find in those Prophecies those actions that are purely
indifferent; for example, that the King of _England_ did appear upon a
Scaffold without his Doublet; that in the place where he was beheaded,
another man had been killed three days before; that _Libertat_ went a
Hunting with a Greyhond, and a Blood-hond; that the two little Royals
were conducted to St. _Germain_, rather then to any other place, and such
like.

Fifthly, We find the Birth of several particular persons that were born
after his death.

Sixthly, The Governments of Places given by the free will of Kings to
such and such.

All these things cannot be known by judicial Astrology, seeing that in
Heaven there is neither Names, nor Numbers, nor extraordinary Prodigies:
seeing also that judicial Astrology presupposeth the Birth of persons,
that one may foretel their future actions; the same things are also
unknown to Satan, for the Angelical species know nothing of individual
things, but under the notion of possible, and not of future.

Whence I conclude with this irrefragable Argument, that the Author hath
known many several things that are not written in the Heavenly Book, nor
represented to him by Angelical Species, therefore he hath known them
from God himself.

The Author himself in his Epistle to his Son _Cæsar Nostradamus_
confesseth, that he hath foretold many things by Divine Virtue and
Inspiration.

And a little after he saith, that the knowledge of those things, which
meerly depends from free will, cannot be had either by humane auguries,
nor by any other humane knowledge, nor by any secret virtue that
belongeth to sublunary things, but only by a Light, belonging to the
Order of Eternity.

This is not a small Argument, to confirm what we have said, and to
prove that the Author hath evidently been conscious, that his knowledge
came from Heaven, and that Gods goodness did him that grace; for having
rejected and abhorred other means, that Impostors make use of for
foretelling something.

He writteth all these things of himself: First, in his Liminary Epistle
to his Son _Cæsar_, he conjureth him, that when he should go about to
study the foretelling of future things by Astrology, to avoid all kind of
Magick, prohibited by the Holy Scripture, and the Canons of the Church;
and to encourage him the more to it, he relateth what happened to him,
_viz._ that having been Divinely enlightned, and fully persuaded that God
only can give the knowledge of future things, which absolutely depends
of the free will of men, he did burn abundance of Writings, wherein was
taught the Art of Prophecying, and as they were a burning, there came
out a great flame, which was like (he thought) to burn his House all to
ashes, by which accident he understood the falsity of such Writings,
and that the Devil was vexed to see his plots discovered; besides that,
he confesseth that being the greatest Sinner of the World, nevertheless
he got that favour from Heaven by a Divine Inspiration; and because no
body should doubt of it, he learnedly expoundeth wherein consisteth that
inspired Revelation, he saith that it is, _A participation of the Eternal
Divinity_, by which we come to judge of what the Holy Ghost imparteth to
us; by that participation of Eternity, the Author doth not understand a
communication of the continuance of the Divine being, but a participation
of the Divine knowledge, measured by its Eternity, as the Schools terms
it.

Effectively, the Author compareth this participation to a glistering
flame, which createth a new day in our understanding, which flame
proceeding from Gods infinite knowledge, who seeth and comprehendeth
what is Eternity, doth impart unto us what is inclosed in the volubility
of the Heavens.

After this testimony, which wholly destroyeth the Sinister opinions that
men had of his Prophecies, he sheweth how Judicial Astrology may agree
with the knowledge of that which proceedeth from a Prophetical Spirit.

It is true, saith he, that sometimes God imparteth this Light not only
to the unlearned, and to his Holy Prophets, but also to those that
are versed in Judicial Astrology, making that instrumental for the
confirmation of his inspired truths: As we see that natural Sciences,
help the light of the Faith, and make a certain disposition in the mind
fitter then ordinary, to receive those Divine impressions.

Thus (saith he) in the beginning of the Epistle, God did supernaturaly
inspire me, not by any Bacchick fury, nor by Lymphatical motions, as he
did the _Sybilles_; but by Astronomical assertions; that is to say, that
God gave him that grace, not by any Extasy, but by studying those rules,
which Astrology teacheth.

The same things he saith again a little after in this manner: the
Astrologer being in his Study, and consulting the Astronomical Rules upon
the motions of the Heavens, the Conjunction and several Aspects of the
Planets, he guesseth at some future events, of which being not certain,
this Divine Light riseth in his mind, and imparteth clearly to him what
he knew before, only _Ænigmatically_ and obscurely, and in the shade of
that natural light.

Sometimes also (saith he) this Light cometh the first into the
Astrologers mind, and he afterwards comparing the thing revealed unto him
with the Astronomical rules, he seeth that they do wholly agree together;
and this is the method that he hath made use of, to know whether the
inspired truths were agreeing with the Astronomical Calculations; a
method that he hath made use of some times, but not always, for he hath
foretold many things, which he could not read in the Heavens.

By these testimonies of the Author himself, every one may see how he
made use of Judicial Astrology, and wherefore he studied it so much; how
far his knowledge did extend; the glory he giveth to God alone, for his
Prophetical knowledge; what horrour he hath always had against unlawful
means to attain unto it; how much he did value that Grace, considering
his unworthiness; and the manner how the Lord was pleased to gratifie him.




CHAP. VII.

_Answer to the first Objection against ~Nostradamus~, which pretendeth to
rank him among the false Prophets._


Let us see now what calumny pretendeth for the obscuring this Prophet
of our days; the knowledge of future things (saith she) is a priviledge
belonging to the Saints, and to those whom God hath endowed with an
eminent vertue. I acknowledge, it is so commonly, and in the ordinary
way of Grace, but if God be pleased to impart that priviledge to those
that have not attained to that Degree of Holiness, and that it really
appeareth by the reasons of Theologie, that they have been gratified
with it, we are bound to admire his Royal bounty, which giveth when, and
to whom he pleaseth: for example, no body deserveth to be a Marshal of
_France_, but he that hath been in several Battles, and at the taking
of many Towns; but if the King be pleased to honour with that Dignity a
Gentleman that never Warred but against the Deer, the Kings goodness is
to be praised, which extendeth even to those that have not deserved it;
it is the same reason here, it is visibly apparent that _Nostradamus_
hath been enlightned by the Holy Ghost, and yet he hath not imitated
the lifes of those great Saints of the Church: what can be inferred from
thence, but that it was Gods pleasure to extend his bounty upon his
poor Creatures, which is easie to be granted in this point, because the
gift of Prophecy is not a sanctifying Grace, but a supernatural gift,
of which a sinner is capable of, as we see in _Balaam_, _Caiaphas_,
and the _Sybilles_, and much more in a Christian, who observeth Gods
Commandments, and endeavoureth to keep himself in his Grace.

But (saith calumny) Christian piety seemeth to be repugnant to this
Divine disposition, seeing that in _Nostradamus_ time, there were
thousands in the Church of God that were capable of this favour, and to
prefer to them a Physitian, an Astrologer, and an Almanack-maker, is a
thing that the Wits cannot apprehend so well, as to frame a good opinion
for this Author.

Hold there Reader, do not enter into the Sanctuary of Gods secret
Judgements, you should loose you self, and never find the way out: how
many such questions might I ask you? why did God in former times chuse
the Family and person of David, and preferred it to so many others of the
Children of _Israel_? why did Christ raise _Judas_ to the dignity of an
Apostle, preferring him before _Nathaniel_, and so many others that lived
Holily.

Bring therefore no more such questions, but say with the Scripture, _As
it pleased the Lord, so it was done_: I will nevertheless give you some
satisfaction in that point. There was two things in the Author which
might have procured that blessing from God.

The first is, that having in his possession those writtings which
promised the knowledge of future things, to which he was much inclined,
he slighted and burnt them, being persuaded that God alone was the Author
of this Grace; I do esteem that action very Heroical in its circumstance,
because being inticed by a vehement curiosity to know future things, and
having in his hand the means that opened the way to it, he did Sacrifice
them to God, for which perhaps God was willing to gratifie him with this
favour.

The second thing that was in _Nostradamus_ is, that he had naturally a
_Genius_ for the knowing of future things, as himself confesseth in two
Epistles to King _Henry_ the II. and to _Cæsar_ his own Son, and besides
that _Genius_, the knowledge of Astrology, did smooth him the way to
discover many future events. Having those two things, he had a greater
disposition then others to receive those Supernatural Lights; and as God
is pleased to work sweetly in his Creatures, and to give some forerunning
dispositions to those Graces he intendeth to bestow, it seemeth that to
that purpose he did chuse our Author to reveal him so many wonderful
secrets.

We see every day that God in the distributing of his Graces carrieth
himself towards us, according to our humours and natural inclinations,
he employeth those that have a generous and Martial heart for the
defence of his Church, and the destruction of Tyrants; he leadeth those
of a melancholick humour into Colledges and Cloisters, and cherisheth
tenderly, those that are of meek and mild disposition; even so, seeing
_Nostradamus_ inclined to this kind of knowledge, he gave him in a great
measure the grace of it.




CHAP. VIII.

_Answer to the second Objection, which would have him pass for a Doctor._


We shall not have much to say to these more moderate persons, seeing
that we have already given the reason of it, _viz._ the covetousness of
the Booksellers and Printers, who made use of the Authors name, for the
better sale of their false Almanacks, therefore if _Jodelle_ the Poet
grounded upon this opinion, made that Satyrical Distick.

    _~Nostra damus~ cum falsa damus, nam fallere nostrum est,_
      _Et cum falsa damus, nil nisi ~Nostra damus~._

We answer him,

    _~Nostra damus~ cum verba damus quæ ~Nostradamus~ dat,_
      _Nam quæcunque dedit nil nisi vera dedit._

Or thus

    _~Vera damus~ cum verba damus quæ ~Nostradamus~ dat,_
      _Sed cum ~Nostra damus~, nil nisi falsa damus._




CHAP. IX.

_Answer to the third Objection, which accuseth him of the Black Art, and
of Negromancy._


The more doth Calumny lift up her self against this great man, the weaker
are her arguments, like the smoke which is so much the easier dissipated,
as it ascendeth higher.

Her reason is impertinent in this distributive argument, he hath known
those things (saith she) which he could not know by the Planets, and he
had them not from God, therefore he had them from Satan.

And we answer this argument in the same way, he hath known those things
which he could not know by the Planets, nor by Satan, therefore he had
them from God; this Argument is concluding, but that of calumny halteth,
for it ought to have proved that he had not his knowledge from God, and
that all those things he hath known may be known to Satan, which two
things we have manifestly proved to be false, therefore if the Lord
_Florimond de Raimond_ was alive, I believe he would correct what he hath
written against him.




CHAP. X.

_Answer to the fourth Objection, of Calumny, which brandeth our Author
with the title of Chief of the Seductors and Impostors._


The Weapons of this _Medusa_ are sharper in this point then in others,
therefore our Buckler accordingly must be of the best mettle and temper.

We cannot deny but _Nostradamus_ hath affected obscurity, himself
acknowledgeth it in his two Epistles, in that to _Cæsar_ his son, he
saith, he hath done it, not only because of the times wherein he lived,
but also by reason of those that were to follow, in the times wherein he
lived the Case was as it is now, _Veritas odium parit_, and this hatred
in powerful men is prejudicial to those that speak the Truth, he was also
cautious in that, by reason of the times following; for if he had plainly
declared what he meant, the Wits would have laughed at it, and would not
have believed those strange revolutions that came to pass, and which our
Author had foretold. In his Epistle to _Henry_ the II he telleth him,
that he doth purposely make use of obscure terms to express his mind, for
the reasons before alledged.

Now _Calumny_ saith, that this affectation of obscurity is a sign that
God was not the Author of his Knowledge, seeing that by this obscurity
they have proved unprofitable to the Church.

I answer first, that the consequence is false; for the Holy Prophets have
spoken so obscurely, that a great part of what they had Prophecied was
not known till after it had come to pass.

I answer secondly, that although Prophecies were not understood till
after the fulfilling thereof, it doth not follow that they were
unprofitable; because by their fulfilling in due time, we gather, that
he who revealed them was the true God, Lord of times and Eternity, and
therefore being the God of _Israel_, and of the Christians, he ought to
be worshiped. By this principle _Cyrus_ and _Alexander_ knew the true
God, _Cyrus_ by having seen the Prophecies of _Isaiah_, and _Alexander_
those of _Daniel_.

Therefore as the Prophecies of the Saints have not been fruitless, though
not understood till they were fulfilled, even so we must not infer that
_Nostradamus_’s Prophecies have been useless, though they have remained
in obscurity so long a while.

Besides, there is no doubt but _Nostradamus_ having Prophecied so many
several things that are come to pass, but that hereafter when the
Heathen shall see it they shall glorifie God, and shall acknowledge a
true Religion, as did _Cyrus_, who many Authors believe to have obtained
Salvation.

I answer in the third place, that God permitteth ordinarily that
Prophecies lie long in the dark, and then raiseth the Spirit of some men
to expound them, as he did that of _Daniel_ to interpret the 70 Weeks of
the _Babylonian_ Captivity, Prophecied by _Jeremiah_, to incourage the
faithful three ways.

First, in shewing them, that if the first Prophecies have been punctually
fulfilled, the rest will likewise come to pass, seeing the same God hath
dictated them.

Secondly, in unfolding to them the future wonders, of which they shall be
partakers.

Thirdly, in giving warning how they may attain to them, and shew those
accidents that might be an hindrance. Thus God did permit, that for the
space of 100. years _Nostradamus_ Prophecies should lie in darkness, and
be contemned, but after that time God will raise some body to interpret
them, whence the faithful seeing so many things foretold come to pass so
exactly, will incourage one another by seing so many wonderful prodigies,
of whom they shall be Eye Witnesses.

As for my part I have undertaken this Work, only to authorise the wonders
that shall be seen in our days, and to invite the Christian Princes to
the same design.

The conclusion of this discourse is, that our _Medusa Calumny_, must
needs retreat in her dens, and that we ought to forgive those Authors
that have spoken so ill of our Author, seing they wanted the Intelligence
of his Prophecies, and that the Church did suspend the authorising of
them.




CHAP. XI.

_Some difficulties against what we have said, drawn out of ~Nostradamus~
his own Epistles._


We have (thanks be to God) sheltered this famous man from the back-biting
of _Calumny_, but that we may clear wholly the Heaven of this reputation,
we add this Chapter more for the clearing of some words that are in
his Epistles, which seem to contradict some of those things we have
said; the Author in his Epistles to his Son _Cæsar_, after he had said
that God had disposed him to receive thy impression of supernatural
lights, not by a _Bacchant furor_, nor by a _Lymphatical motion_, but by
_Astronomical assertions_, he saith in the same Epistle towards the end;
_That sometimes in the Week being surprised by a Lymphatick humor, and
making his Nocturnal Studies sweet by his calculations, he made Books of
Prophecies, each one containing a hundred Astronomical Stanza’s, which he
endeavoured to set out something obscurely_, from which words it might be
gathered, that he made his Prophecies by a Lymphatical Spirit, and by the
only judicial Astrology.

And in the Epistle to King _Henry_ the II. he seemeth to confess,
that his Prophecie is nothing but a natural Genius, which he had by
Inheritance from his Ancestors.

To these difficulties I answer, supposing first that anciently those were
called Lymphaticks, who were mad for Love; because the first that was
observed among the Ancients to be mad with that passion, threw himself
into the water, which in Latine is called _Lympha_, whence all those that
were afterwards transported with the excess of any passion, either of
Love, Melancholy, Choler or Envy, have been called Lymphaticks.

So that in this place a Lymphatical motion is nothing properly but a deep
Melancholy, which separating us from all Earthly things, doth transport
the mind to extraordinary thoughts either good or bad.

This being suposed, I say that the Author confesseth, that his retreat,
solitariness, nocturnal Watchings, and Melancholy, have disposed him
much to the receiving of that Heavenly flame, which is the cause of
Vaticination and Prophecie.

And because he did often spend the whole nights in this study, this
Nocturnal retreat caused in him a retirement from all worldly things,
at which time he felt a Divine elevating Virtue, that raised his
understanding to those Divine Knowledges.

And because this elevating Vertue was caused in him by Divine operation,
he doth attribute always his Prophecies to God alone; and by reason that
this elevation hath some resemblance with that of the Lymphaticks, he
saith, that sometimes he did Lymphatise not properly speaking, but by
resemblance.

So that it is true, our Author did not receive his Prophecies by
Lymphatical motion, or _Bacchant furie_, but from God himself, who did
work in him while he observed his Astronomical assertions; and it is
also true, that he felt this Divine operation by a kind of a Lymphatical
motion.

Concerning what he saith to _Henry_ the II. it is certain he maketh use
of that Language as much by a motive of Truth to conceal that Grace which
he had received from God, as of Humility.

By a Motive of Truth, because effectually; because all the
_Nostradamus_’s had some tincture of Prophecie, and his Son the Capucin
acknowledgeth it himself.

By a Motive of Humility; because acknowledging himself to be a miserable
sinner, and seeing that this gift of Prophecie was not ordinarily granted
but unto Saints. He chuseth rather to attribute his Prophecies to his
Genius, than otherways to procure a Fame and Authority to his predictions.

In confirmation of what we have said, _That he was often in that
transport_, many years before his death he made the Stanza of the
Century, in which is contained all the great Works of the Philosophers,
and foretelleth, that a great Divine shall attain to the perfection of
that great Work, which Divine is called, the _Divine Verbe_, turning
into _French_ the Word θεολογος, which signifieth Divine Word or Verb.
Nevertheless he never wrought himself at that Work, but got his living
Honourably by his practise of Physick, by which we may see, that he did
write some things which himself understood not, unless they were such
general ones, as might be read in the Heavens.




CHAP. XII.

_Elogies given to ~Nostradamus~ by several Authentical Authors._


If several Authors either by envy or ignorance have defamed our Author,
others of no shall repute have taken his defence in hand.

D’_Aurat_ one of the most excellent Poets of _France_, living at the
same time as _Nostradamus_, made a few explications of his Prophecies,
which as the report goes, did please the Readers. I am sorry I could not
get them, it would have been some ease to me; for it is easier to add
than to invent. The first Volume of the Lord _la Croix du Main_, maketh
honourable mention of him, the same saith, that his Motto was _Felix
Oviam prior Ætas_, Happy the first Age that was contented with their
Flock, shewing by that, what esteem he had of frugality and sincerity
of manners, and what aversion he had against the Vices of his Age,
the unruliness of manners, and cousenage of men. _Ronsard_ the Prince
of the _French_ Poets singeth his praises: The Lord _Boucher_ in that
great Volume, intitled the _Mistical Crown_, in favour of the future
_Croisade_, doth vindicate our Author from _Calumny_, and expoundeth some
of his Prophecies pretty happily.

I will not relate here what his Son _Cæsar Nostradamus_ writeth modestly
of him in his History of _Provence_, under _Lewis_ the XII. _Henry_ the
II. and _Charles_ the IX. his Evidence may be suspected, because of the
Consanguinity.

One of the greatest Wits of this last Age, who desireth to be nameless,
giveth him this Character.

First, That God Almighty hath chosen _Michael Nostradamus_ among the
common sort of Christians, to impart unto him the knowledge of many
prodigious and extraordinary future things.

Secondly, He maintaineth, that after the Apostles and Canonical
Prophets, he is the first of all in three things, in his certainty and
infallibility, in the generality and in the quantity. As to the first,
he doth not doubt but the Abbot _Joachim_ ought to give him place; for
though he hath foretold some things that have come to pass, he hath
written a hundred others which are meer fopperies.

Thirdly, He maintaineth that the Emperour _Leo_ in his prophetical Tables
is far below him; for he doth only aim at those things which regard the
Eastern Empire, as _Theophrastus Paracelsus_ hath done for the Western.

Concerning the quantity of things, he maintaineth, that none of the
others can dispute it with him; for _Nostradamus_ hath made above a
thousand stanza’s (if we had them all) each of which containeth two or
three prophetical Truths, some of which regard the East, others the West,
others some private Kingdoms and States others private and particular
things, and all with Truth and certainty.




CHAP. XIII.

_What these Stanza’s Prophecie of._


The Author in his Epistle to King _Henry_ the II. saith, that he treateth
of things which were to happen in many Cities and Towns of _Europe_, and
of a part of _Asia_ and _Africa_.

And to say Truth, I have found nothing in them concerning the East or
West, _Jappan_ or _China_.

He treateth chiefly of _France_ as of his Native Kingdom, and of his own
Countrey _Provence_, and that which is next to it, viz. _Piemont_.

He speaketh amply of the Popes, and of _Italy_, _Turky_ and _England_:
As for the Empire _Spain_, and _Suedeland_, he doth moderately speak
of them. Concerning _Æthiopia_ and _Africa_ there is some nine or ten
Stanza’s.

In all those places he foretelleth many things, not only general for
every State, but also particular and individual for several persons. He
also foretelleth many supernatural prodigies in the Heavens, the Air, the
Sea, and the Land.

He hath inserted among his Prophecies four Horoscopes, the first of the
Grandfather of the Lord l’_Ainier_ in the Province of _Anjou_; the second
of one called _Urnel Vausile_; the third of one _Cosme du Jardin_; and
the fourth of one, whom he nameth not, but describeth him by his stature.




CHAP. XIV.

_Since what time these Prophecies began._


It is certain that they began in _January_ 1555. because he dedicated
the first seven Centuries to his Son _Cæsar_ the first day of _March_ in
the said year, and consequently they were made before that time, and we
cannot allow less than two Months to an Author for the making of 700.
Stanza’s: Nevertheless for a greater manifestation of his prophetical
Spirit, I have not found any of his Prophecies that did come to pass
before the first of _March_ 1555.

As for the Eight, Ninth and Ten Century, there is reason to believe, that
the effect of them doth not begin before the _27 June 1558_. which is the
date of his Liminary Epistle to _Henry_ the II. Nevertheless he saith
in the same Epistle, that in a writing by it self he will set down the
exposition of his Prophecies, beginning the 14 of _March_ 1557. and in
the Epistle to _Nostradamus_ his Son, he saith in general that he hath
composed Books of Prophecies, each one containing one hundred Stanza’s,
without specifying whether he spoke of the seven that he dedicated to
him, or of all the others.

As for my part, I believe he had made them all in the year 1555. but
that he had not yet examined the three last Centuries, according to the
Calculation of his Astronomical assertions, as he seemeth to indicate
often in his Epistle to _Henry_ II. and to say the truth, I have found
some Stanza’s, which were fulfilled before the year 1558. though very few.

As for the extent of his Prophecies, it is certain, that it is to the end
of the World, as I shall make it appear in the explication of the 48, the
49, and 56. Stanza’s of the first Century, and the 72, 73, and 94. of the
tenth, and all according to the Holy Scripture.

All these things being premised, we shall proceed to the explication of
the Prophecies, setting first the Authors Luminary Epistle to his Son.




THE

PREFACE

TO _Mr._

Michael Nostradamus

HIS

PROPHECIES,

_Ad ~Cæsarem Nostradamum~ Filium vita & Felicitas._


Thy late coming, _Cæsar Nostradamus_, my son, hath caused me to bestow
a great deal of time in continual and nocturnal watchings, that I might
leave a Memorial of me after my death, to the common benefit of Mankind,
concerning the things which the Divine Essence hath revealed to me by
Astronomical Revolutions; and since it hath pleased the immortal God,
that thou are come late into this World, and canst not say that thy years
that are but few, but thy Months are incapable to receive into thy weak
understanding, what I am forced to define of futurity, since it is not
possible to leave thee in Writing, what might be obliterated by the
injury of times, for the Hereditary word of _occult prædictions_ shall
be lockt up in my brest, considering also that the events are definitely
uncertain, and that all is governed by the power of God, who inspired
us not by a Bacchant fury or Lymphatick motion, but by Astronomical
affections. _Soli numine Divino afflati præsagiunt & Spiritu Prophetico
particularia_: Although I have often foretold long before what hath
afterwards come to pass, and in particular Regions, acknowledging all to
have been done by Divine Vertue and Inspiration, being willing to hold my
peace by reason of the injury, not onely of the present time, but also
of the future, and to put them in Writing, because the Kingdoms, Sects,
and Regions shall be so Diametrically opposed, that if I should relate
what shall happen hereafter, those of the present Reign, Sect, Religion
and Faith, would find it so disagreeing with their fances, that they
would condemn that which future Ages shall find and know to be true;
considering also the saying of our Saviour, _Nolite Sanctum dare canibus
ne conculcent pedibus & conversi discumpant vos_, which hath been the
cause that I have withdrawn my tongue from the Vulgar, and my Pen from
Paper. But afterwards I was willing for the common good to enlarge my
self in dark and abstruse Sentences, declaring the future Events, chiefly
the most urgent, and those which I foresaw (what ever humane mutation
happened) would not offend the hearers, all under dark figures more then
Prophetical, for although, _Abscondisti hæc a sapientibus & prudensibus_,
i. e. _potentibus & Regibus enucleasti ea exiguis & tennibus_, and
the Prophets by means onely of the immortal God and good Angels, have
received the Spirit of Vaticination, by which they foresee things, and
foretel future events; for nothing is perfect without him, whose power
and goodness is so great to his Creatures, that though they are but men,
nevertheless by the likeness of our good Genius to the Angels, this heat
and Prophetical power draws near us, as it happens by the Beams of the
Sun, which cast their influence both on Elementary and not Elementary
bodies; as for us who are men, we cannot attain any thing by our natural
knowledge, of the secrets of God our Creator. _Quia non est nostrum nosse
tempora nec momenta_, &c.

Besides, although there is, or may come some persons, to whom God
Almighty will reveal by impressions made on his understanding some
secrets of the future, according to the Judicial Astrology, as it hath
happened in former times, that a certain power and voluntary faculty
possessed them as a flame of fire, so that by his inspiration, they
were able to judge of Divine and Humane things: for the Divine works
that are absolutely necessary, God will end. But my son, I speak to
thee too obscurely; but as for the secrets that are received by the
subtle Spirit of fire, by which the understanding being moved, doth
contemplate the highest Celestial Bodies, as being active and vigilant
to the very pronunciation without fear, or any shameful loquacity: all
which proceeded from the Divine Power of the Eternal God, from whom
all goodness floweth. Now my son, although I have inserted the name of
Prophet here, I will not attribute to my self so sublime a Title, for
_qui Propheta dicitur hodie olim vocabatur videns_, and Prophets are
those properly (my Son) that see things remote from the natural knowledge
of Men; but put the case, the Prophets by the means of the perfect light
of Prophecy, may see as well Divine things as Humane, (which cannot be
seeing the effects of future predictions) do extend a great way, for the
secrets of God are incomprehensible, and the efficient power moveth afar
off the natural knowledge, taking their beginning at the free will, cause
those things to appear, which otherwise could not be known, neither by
humane auguries, or any hidden knowledge or secret virtue under Heaven,
but only by the means of some indivisible Eternal being, or Comitial
and Herculean agitation, the causes come to be known by the Cœlestial
motion. I say not therefore my Son, that you may not understand me well,
because the knowledge of this matter cannot yet be imprinted in thy weak
brain, but that future causes afar off are subject to the knowledge of
humane Creatures, if (notwithstanding the Creature) things present and
future were neither obscure nor hidden from the intellectual seal; but
the perfect knowledge of the cause of things, cannot be acquired without
the Divine Inspiration, seeing that all Prophetical Inspiration received,
hath its original principle from God the Creator, next, from good Luck,
and afterwards from Nature, therefore cases indifferently produced or
not produced, the Prophecy partly happens where it hath been foretold,
for the understanding being intellectually created, cannot see occult
things, unless it be by the voice coming from the _Lymbo_, by the means
of the thin flame, to which the knowledge of future causes is inclined;
and also my Son I intreat thee not to bestow thy understanding on such
fopperies, which drie up the Body and damn the Soul, bringing vexation
to the Senses; chiefly abhor the vanity of the execrable Magick,
forbidden by the Sacred Scriptures, and by the Canons of the Church; in
the first of which is excepted Judicial Astrology, by which, and by the
means of Divine Inspiration, with continual supputations, we have put
in writting our Prophecies. And although this occult Philosophy was not
forbidden, I could never be persuaded to meddle with it, although many
Volums concerning that Art, which hath been concealed a great while,
were presented to me; but fearing what might happen, after I had read
them, I presented them to _Vulcan_, who while he was a devouring them,
the flame mixing with the Air, made an unwonted light more bright then
the usual flame, and as if it had been a Lightning, shining all the
house over, as if it had been all in a flame; therefore that henceforth
you might not be abused in the search of the perfect Transformation, as
much selene as solar, and to seek in the waters uncorruptible mettal; I
have burnt them all to ashes, but as to the judgement which cometh to be
perfected by the help of the Cœlestial Judgement, I will manifest to you,
that you may have knowledge of future things, rejecting the fantastical
imaginations that should happen by the limiting the particularity of
Places; by Divine inspiration, supernatural, according to the Cœlestial
figures, the places, and a part of the time, by an occult, property, and
by a Divine virtue, power and faculty, in the presence of which the three
times are comprehended by Eternity, revolution being tyed to the cause
that is past, present, and future, _Quia omnia sunt Nuda & aperta_, &c.
therefore my Son, thou mayst notwithstanding thy tender brain comprehend
things that shall happen hereafter, and may be foretold by cœlestial
natural lights, and by the Spirit of Prophecy; not that I will attribute
to my self the name of a Prophet, but as a mortal man, being no farther
from Heaven by my sence, then I am from Earth by my Feet, _possum errare,
falli, decipi_; I am the greatest Sinner of the World, subject to all
humane afflictions, but being supprised sometimes in the week by a
Prophetical humour, and by a long Calculation, pleasing my self in my
Study, I have made Books of Prophecies, each one containing a hundred
Astronomical Stanza’s, which I have joyned obscurely, and are perpetual
Vaticinations from this year to the year 3797. at which some perhaps
will frown, seeing so large an extention of time, and that I treat of
every thing under the Moon, if thou livest the natural Age of a Man, thou
shalt see in thy Climat, and under the Heaven of thy Nativity the future
things that have been foretold, although God only is he who knoweth the
Eternity of his Light, proceeding from himself; and I say freely to
those to whom his incomprehensible greatness hath by a long melancholick
inspiration revealed, that by the means of this occult cause Divinely
manifested, chiefly by two principal causes, which are comprehended in
the understanding of him that is Inspired and Prophecyeth, one is that
he cleareth the supernatural Light in the person that foretelleth by
the Doctrine of the Planets, and Prophecyeth by inspired Revelation,
which is a kind of participation of the Divine Eternity, by the means
of which the Prophet judgeth of what the Divine Spirit hath given him
by the means of God the Creatour, and by a natural instigation, _viz._
that what is predicted is true, and hath taken its original from above,
and such light and small flame is of all efficacy and sublimity, no
less then the natural light makes the Philosophers so secure, that by
the means of the principles of the first cause, they have attained the
greatest depth of the profoundest science; but that I may not wander too
far (my Son) from the capacity of thy sense, as also, because I find
that Learning would be at a great loss, and that before the universal
Conflagration shall happen so many great Inundations, that there shall
scarce be any Land, that shall not be covered with water, and this shall
last so long, that except _Ænographies_ and _Topographies_ all shall
perish, also before and after these Inundations in many Countreys there
shall be such scarcety of rain, and such a deal of fire, and burning
stones shall fall from Heaven, that nothing unconsumed shall be left,
and this shall happen a little while before the great conflagration; for
although the Planet _Mars_ makes an end of his course, and is come to the
end of his last Period, nevertheless he shall begin it again, but some
shall be gathered in _Aquarius_ for many years, others in _Cancer_ also
for many years, and now we are governed by the Moon, under the power of
Almighty God; which Moon before she hath finished her Circuit, the Sun
shall come, and then _Saturn_, for according to the Cœlestial Signs,
the Reign of _Saturn_ shall come again, so that all being Calculated,
the World draws near to an Anaragonick revolution, and at this present
that I write this before 177. years, three Months, eleven Days, through
Pestilence, Famine, War, and for the most part Inundations, the World
between this and that prefixed time, before and after for several times
shall be so diminished, and the people shall be so few, that they shall
not find enough to Till the Ground, so that they shall remain fallow as
long as they have been Tilled; although we be in the seventh Millenary,
which ends all and brings us near the eighth, where the Firmament of the
eighth Sphere is, which in a _Latitudinary dimention_ is the place where
the great God shall make an end of the revolution, where the Cœlestial
Bodies shall begin to move again. By that Superiour motion that maketh
the Earth firm and stable, _non inclinabitur in seculum seculi_, unless
his will be accomplished, and not otherwise; although by ambiguous
opinions exceeding all natural reasons by _Mahometical_ Dreams, also
sometimes God the Creator by the Ministers of his Messengers of fire
and flame shows to our external senses, and chiefly to our eyes, the
causes of future Predictions, signifying the future Event, that he will
manifest to him that Prophecyeth for the Prophecy that is made by the
Internal Light, comes to judge of the thing, partly with and by the means
of External Light, for although the party which seemeth to have by the
eye of understanding, what it hath not by the Lœsion of its imaginative
sense, there is no reason why what he foretelleth should come by Divine
Inspiration, or by the means of an Angelical Spirit, inspired into the
Prophetick person, annointing him with vaticination, moving the fore part
of his fancy, by divers nocturnal apparitions, so that by Astronomical
administration, he Prophecyeth with a Divine certitude, joyned to the
Holy prediction of the future, having no other regard then to the
freedom of his mind. Come now my Son, and understand what I find by my
revolutions, which are agreeing with the Divine Inspiration, _viz._ that
the Swords draws near to us now, and the Plague and the War more horrid
then hath been seen in the Life of three Men before, as also by Famine,
which shall return often, for the Stars agree with the revolution, as
also he said _visitabo in virgâ ferreà iniquitates eorum & in verberibus
percutiam eos_, for the Mercies of God shall not be spread a while, my
Son, before most of my Prophecies shall come to pass; then oftentimes
shall happen sinister storms, (_Conteram ergo ~(said the Lord)~ &
confringam & non miserebor_) and a thousand other accidents that shall
happen by Waters and continual Rains, as I have more fully at large
declared in my other Prophecies, written in _solutâ oratione_, limiting
the places, times and prefixed terms, that men coming after, may see and
know that those accidents are certainly come to pass, as we have marked
in other places, speaking more clearly, although the explication be
involved in obscurity, _sed quando submovenda erit ignorantia_, the case
shall be made more clear; making an end here, my Son, accept of this Gift
of thy Father _Michael Nostradamus_, hoping to expound to thee every
Prophecy of these Stanza’s, praying to the Immortal God, that he would
grant thee a long Life in Felicity.

                 _From ~Salon~ this 1. of ~March~ 1555._




THE TRUE

PROPHECIES

OR

PROGNOSTICATIONS

OF

Michael Nostradamus,

Physician to _HENRY_ II. _FRANCIS_ II. And _CHARLES_ IX. Kings of FRANCE,
and one of the most excellent _Astronomers_ that ever were.




_CENTURY_ I.


I.

    French.

    Estant assis, de nuit secrette estude,
    Seul, reposé sur la selle d’airain,
    Flambe exigüe, sortant de solitude,
    Fait proferer qui n’est a croire vain.

    English.

    Sitting by Night in my secret Study
    Alone, resting upon the Brazen Stool,
    A slight flame breaking forth out of that solitude,
    Makes me utter what is not in vain to believe.

ANNOTATION.

In this _Stanza_, _Nostradamus_ expresseth those Humane dispositions
which he made use of to be favoured of God, for the knowledge of future
things, to the benefit of the Publick.

The first Disposition, was the tranquility of Mind, when he saith,
_Sitting by night_; Because a troubled Mind cannot see clearly the Things
it is busie about, no more than tossed Waters can distinctly represent
the Objects that are opposed to them. Thus we read in the Scripture,
that the Prophet _Elishah_, being transported with Zeal against _Joram_
King of _Israel_; and nevertheless willing to consult God concerning the
event of the Warr against the _Moabites_, called for a Minstrel, that the
Harmony of the Instrument might quiet his Mind, as it did happen. _And
it came to pass when the Minstrel played, that the Hand of the Lord came
upon him_, 2 Kings _chap. 3. ver. 15._

The Author in his _Dedicatory Epistle_ to his Son _Cæsar_, calleth
this Tranquility of Mind, _A long Melancholick Inspiration_; because
the Melancholick Humour and Mind sequestreth a Man from the concerns
of worldly things, and maketh him present to himself, so that his
Understanding is not darkned by a multitude of _Species_ that troubles
its Operation.

The Second Disposition, was, the Silence of the Night; For Man who is
compounded of Body and Soul, doth notably intricate himself in External
things by the commerce of the Senses with the Objects; which obligeth
him to withdraw himself from visible things, when he intends to apply
himself to some serious Study. And as the silence of the Night causeth in
the Universe a cessation of noises and clashings in Business, Visits and
Colloquies, the Mind is then more at rest. Besides that, Night covering
with her Darkness our Hemisphere, our Senses are less distracted, and
our Internal Faculties are more united to serve the Operations of the
Understanding.

Therefore the Author in his two _Liminary Epistles_, makes often mention
of his continual Nocturnal Watchings, of his Sweet-smelling nocturnal
Studies, and of his Nocturnal and Prophetical Calculations.

The Third Disposition, was Solitariness; that is, having no other
Conversation then that of his Books, being retired in his Study, Alone.
For it seemeth that God commonly maketh use of Solitariness when he doth
impart himself to Men, and revealeth them his Oracles: And the _Sybils_
were chosen to be Prophets, as much for their Solitariness, as for their
Chastity.

The Author saith, that with those three Dispositions he raised himself
to the knowledge of future things; which is signified by those words,
_Resting upon the Brazen Stool_. _Servius_ in his _Commentaries_ upon
_Virgil_, speaking of this Brazen Stool, saith two things of it. The
First, that this Stool was a Table set upon a _Trevet_, called by the
_Greeks_ τρίπους, and by the Latines _Tripus_. The Second is, that the
_Sybils_, or the Priests of the _Delphick_ Temple of _Apollo_, got upon
that Table, when they went about to pronounce their Oracles. _Pliny_, in
his 33. Book, Chap. 3. saith, that they called those Tables _Cortinas_,
and that some were made of Brass for the use aforesaid.

From the use of that Brazen _Trevet_ is come the Proverb, _Ex tripode
loqui_. When one speaketh like an Oracle. Thus the Author willing to
express, that being in his Study in the solitariness of the Night, he
raised himself to the Knowledge of Future things, to write them, and
transmit them to Posterity; he saith, _He was sitting or resting upon the
Brazen Stool_.

Thus raising himself, and taking his Pen in hand to write what he should
learn, he saith in the Third Verse, that _A slight Flame_, or small
Light did insinuate it self in his understanding, by whose splendor and
brightness he saw future things.

The Author in his Epistle to _Cæsar_ his Son, expoundeth always this
Prophetical Light, by the comparison of a shining Flame, and calleth
it rather a Flame than a pure Light, because this Light doth not only
discover the Mysteries, but more-over it lightens in us a certain Heat
and Prophetical Power, as himself terms it; as if we should say a Sacred
Enthusiasm, even (saith he) as the Sun coming near us with his Light,
not only darteth upon all Elementary things the brightness of his Beams,
but withal infuseth in them a certain quickning heat, which causeth
the Vegetables to grow, and upholdeth the Being of all other natural
things; Even so (saith he) this good _Genius_, as the Ancients term it;
or as we Christians say, that Divine Spirit of Prophecy coming near
our understandings, not only importeth a Light to them, but more-over
a certain heat and Prophetical Power, which strenghteneth them in the
knowledge of the aforesaid things, and causeth them to breath out, as by
a Sacred Enthusiasm some Prophetical Verses.

Which happeneth to them (saith the Author) coming out of Solitude, that
is to say, when their Spirit stoopeth down, and by degrees cometh down
from that sublime Region and high elevation, taking the Pen to write down
the future time. Therefore he with his dispositions participating of that
_slight flame, coming out of his solitude_, began to write and to utter,
_What is not in vain to believe_.

The things that the Author hath written, shall not be unprofitable as we
have proved already, and the time will come, when by the means of Divine
Providence the Church shall receive the fruit thereof, at which we ought
not to wonder, seeing that God saith of himself in _Isaiah_ _Chap. 48.
Ver. 17._ _I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit._

The Author foretelleth many wonders, of which we ought to be certain by
the verification of those that are already past, seeing that it is the
same Spirit that shewed them all.

The same Prophecies are also profitable, in that every where the Author
condemneth Seditious and Rebellious persons, and Prophecieth the Churches
Victory over her Enemies.

They are also profitable for particular Men that understand the meaning
of them, for by it they may provide for their own business, according to
the storm, undertaking nothing but upon sure grounds, following always
the best party, and disposing themselves to patience, when the calamities
are general, and involve together the guilty and guiltless. Therefore our
Author saith well, _A slight flame breaking forth out of that solitude,
makes me utter what is not in vain to believe_.


II.

    French.

    La Verge en main, mise au milieu des Branches,
    De l’Onde je moüille & le Limbe & le Pied,
    En peur j’escris fremissant par les manches;
    Splendeur Divine: le Divine prez s’assied.

    English.

    With Rod in hand, set in the middle of the Branches,
    With water I wet the Limb and the Foot,
    In fear I writ, quaking in my sleeves,
    Divine splendor! the Divine sitteth by.

ANNOT.

Amongst the customs, the Ancients observed, before they pronounced their
Oracles; one was to take a Tuffie Branch of Laurel, and with it dipt in
water, to sprinkle the edges and Columns of the Table, that was upon the
Brazen Trevet, by which ceremonies they procured credit to their Oracles.

The Author willing to let us know, that his Verses were not only a simple
writing, but also Prophetical and full of Oracles, doth represent them
to us by this Metaphore of the Ancients, when they did amuse the people
with their ambiguous, and many times fallacious Oracles.

Being then sitting and quiet in his solitariness; coming out of that
great devotion of mind, animated by the virtue of his good _Genius_, he
putteth first _the Rod into his hand_, that is the Pen, and putteth it
_in the middle of the Branches_, putting it between his Fingers. Secondly
he dippeth this Rod _into Water_, dipping his Pen in his Ink; with this
Pen dipt in Ink, _he wetteth the Limb and the Foot_, writing upon his
paper from one end to the other, and from the top to the bottom.

Which we must understand by this word _Lymbe_, which is a Latin word,
signifying the long and narrow pieces of stuffe, which women wore at the
bottom of their Petticoats, therefore the Latins called them _Lymbos_,
from the Latin Verbe _Lambo_, which in matter of cloths signifieth, to
leek or sweep; and because those pieces of cloath were in the bottom of
their Garments, the word hath been afterwards employed to signifie the
brims of some things, so that the Lymbs of a sheet of paper, are the two
margines, and the top and the bottom, as if it were the four ends of a
Quadrangular Figure.

The third Verse sheweth the internal disposition of the Author, after he
hath described his external one; that disposition was a Sacred quaking,
which putting his heart into a palpitation, caused his hands and arms to
shake, as if he had been taken with some fit of an Ague. This quaking is
the disposition which the good _Genius_ causeth in Prophets, that they
may be humbled, and not be puffed up with pride, when they come near the
Majesty of God, as we read in _Daniel_, St. _John_, and the _4th._ of
_Esdras_. Therefore the Author saith:

_In fear I write, quaking in my sleeves._ And because the Divine Spirit
after he hath cast down those, to whom he will impart himself, doth
afterwards quiet them; the Author therefore addeth, that a _Divine
splendor did sit by him_.


III.

    French.

    Quand la littiere du tourbillon versée,
    Et seront faces de leurs Manteaux couvers,
    La Republique par gens nouveaux vexée,
    Lors blancs & rouges jugeront a l’envers.

    English.

    When the litter shall be overthrown by a gust of wind,
    And faces shall be covered with Cloaks,
    The Common-wealth shall be troubled with a new kind of men,
    Then white and red shall judge amiss.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses signifie that a great tempestuous wind was to
happen, in which a litter should be overturned, and every one should
muffle his face in his Cloak, for the fierceness of the wind.

And that presently after the Common-wealth should be troubled with
new Sects and Opinions, which may be understood of the beginning of
Reformation by _Luther_ and _Calvin_, which was about that time.

The last Verse by the white and red signifieth here (as it doth thorough
all the Book) the _French_ and the _Spaniards_, because the _French_
wear white Scarfes, and the _Spaniards_ red ones: and consequently the
troubles and jars that happened presently between those two Nations.


IV.

    French.

    Par l’Univers sera fait un Monarque,
    Qu’en paix & vie ne sera longuement,
    Lors se perdra la Piscature Barque,
    Sera regie en plus grand detriment.

    English.

    In the World shall be one Monarch,
    Who shall be not long alive, nor in peace,
    Then shall be lost the Fishing Boat,
    And be governed with worse detriment.

ANNOT.

That Monarch was _Henry_ the II. King of _France_, who did not Reign
long, but was unfortunately slain, running at Tilt against the Earl of
_Montgomery_ (as we shall see hereafter) and almost during all his Reign
had Wars with _Charles_ the V. Emperour, and his Son _Philip_ the II.
King of _Spain_; the said Emperour in that time did sack _Rome_, took the
Pope _Clement_ the VII. prisoner, which is signified here; as also in
several other places by the loss of the _Fishing Boat_; the Roman Church
being often compared to a Ship or Boat.

    French.

    Chassez seront sans faire long combat.
    Par le Païs seront plus fort grevez,
    Bourg & Cité auront plus grand debat,
    _Carcas_, _Narbonne_ auront cœurs esprouvez.

    English.

    They shall be driven away without great fighting,
    Those of the Countrey shall be more grieved,
    Town and City shall have a greater debate,
    _Carcas_, _Narbonne_ shall have their hearts tryed.

ANNOT.

Herein is nothing mystical, the meaning is that some of the Protestant
party intending to take or vex the Cities of _Carcassone_ and _Narbonne_
in _Languedoc_, shall be easily repulsed, and shall afterward fall upon
the Countrey round about, which shall suffer for.


VI.

    French.

    L’œil de _Ravenne_ sera destitué,
    Quand a ses pieds les aisles sailliront;
    Les deux de _Bresse_ auront constitué,
    _Turin_, _Verceil_, que _Gaulois_ fouleront.

    English.

    The eye of _Ravenna_ shall be forsaken,
    When the wings shall rise at his feet,
    The two of _Brescia_ shall have constituted,
    _Turin_, _Verceil_, which the French shall tread upon.

ANNOT.

This is a confirmation of the fourth Stanza, concerning the loss of the
Pope, _Clement_ the VII. who is called here the eye of _Ravenna_, because
he is Lord of that famous City, which was once an Exarchat of the Empire.

The wings that shall rise at, or against his feet, shall be those of the
Eagle, which are the Arms of the Emperour.

The two of _Brescia_ were the Governour and Proveditor of _Venice_ in
that place, who would at that time have endeavoured to seize upon _Turin_
and _Verceil_, the two chiefest Towns of _Piemont_, but were prevented by
the _French_.


VII.

    French.

    Tard arrivé, l’execution faite,
    Le Vent contrare, Lettres au chemin prinses,
    Les Conjurez quatorze d’une Secte,
    Par le Rousseau seront les entreprinses.

    English.

    One coming too late, the execution shall be done,
    The Wind being contrary, and Letters intercepted by the way,
    The Conspirators fourteen of a Sect,
    By the Red-hair’d Man the undertaking shall be made.

ANNOT.

The sense of the whole is this, there shall be fourteen Conspirators
of one mind, and their Ring-leader, a Red-haired man, who shall be put
to death, because their Reprieve could not come timely enough, being
hindered by cross winds, and Letters intercepted. I could find no
particular things in History concerning this.


VIII.

    French.

    Combien de fois prinse Cité Solaire,
    Seras, changeant les Loix barbares & vaines,
    Ton mal s’approche, plus seras tributaire,
    Le grand _Adrie_ recouvrira tes veines.

    English.

    How often taken O solar City,
    Shalt thou be? changing the barbarian and vain Laws,
    Thy evil growth nigh, thou shalt be more tributary,
    The great _Adria_ shall recover thy veins.

ANNOT.

It is hard to judge what he meaneth by the Solar City that shall be so
often taken.

As by _Adria_, it is certain he meaneth _Venice_, that was so called
anciently, because of its scituation in the _Adriatick_ Sea.


IX.

    French.

    De l’Orient viendra le cœur punique,
    Fascher _Adrie_, & les hoirs _Romulides_,
    Accompagné de la classe Libique,
    Trembler _Melites_, & proches Isles vuides.

    English.

    From the East shall come the _African_ heart,
    To vex _Adria_, and the Heirs of _Romulus_,
    Accompanied with the _Libian_ fleet
    _Melites_ shall tremble, and the Neighbouring Islands be empty.

ANNOT.

This was a clear and true Prognostication of that famous Invasion made
upon _Maltha_, by the grand Signor _Solyman_ the magnificent, in the
year of our Lord 1565. and just ten years after the writing of this
Prophecy, wherein that Island, and some of the Neighbouring ones were
wholly depopulated by the _Turks_, to the terror of _Venice_, called
here _Adria_, and of all the Islands of the _Adriatick_ Sea. For the
better understanding of this, the Reader must observe, that _Punicus_ in
Latin signifieth _Africa_, so that the _African_ heart signifieth the
help the _Turk_ had from _Tunis, Tripoly_, and _Algier_, Cities seated
in _Africa_, and under the Turkish Dominion; by which not only _Maltha_
(which in Latin is _Melita_) but _Venice_ and _Rome_ were put into a
great fright; the conclusion of this Siege was, that after six weeks
time, and the loss of 26000. Men, the _Turks_ were constrained shamefully
to retire. _Vide_ _the Turkish History_.


X.

    French.

    Sergens transmis dans la Cage de Fer,
    Ou les Enfans septains du Roy sont pris,
    Les vieux & Peres sortiront bas d’Enfer,
    Ains mourir voir de son fruit mort & cris.

    English.

    Sergeants sent into an Iron Cage,
    Where the seven Children of the King are,
    The old Men and Fathers shall come out of Hell,
    And before they die shall see the death and cries of their fruit.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy signifieth, that some Sergeants or Executioners shall be
sent into a Prison, to put to death seven Children, servants of a King
that were Imprisoned there, and that some old Men their Fathers, shall
see their death, and hear their cries.


XI.

    French.

    Le mouvement de Sens, Cœur, Pieds, & Mains,
    Seront d’accord, _Naples_, _Leon_, _Sicile_,
    Glaives, Feux, Eaux, puis au Noble Romains,
    Plongez, Tuez, Morts, par cerveau debile.

    English.

    The motion of the Sense, Heart, Feet and Hands,
    Shall agree, _Naples_, _Leon_, _Sicily_,
    Swords, Fires, Waters, then to the noble _Romans_,
    Dipt, Killed, Dead, by a _weak-brain_.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses signifie the concord that shall be among the
_Spanish_ dominions, expressed here by _Sense_, _Heart_, _Feet_, and
_Hands_. After which, the _Romans_ or those of _Rome_, shall be evilly
intreated, being _drowned, killed, and put to death by a weak brain_.
I guess this to have come to pass, when the Emperour _Charles_ the V.
his Army sacked _Rome_, under the command of the Duke of _Bourbon_, who
was killed at the Assault; and of the Prince of _Orange_, who permitted
licentiousness to his Souldiers, and suffered them to commit more
violence, than ever the _Goths_ or _Vandales_ did, and therefore is
called here _weak brain_. This Prince of _Orange_ was of the House of
_Chalon_, after which came that of _Nassau_.


XII.

    French.

    Dans peu ira fauce brute fragile,
    De bas en haut eslevé promptement,
    Puis en estant desloyal & labile,
    Qui de _Verone_ aura gouvernment.

    English.

    Within a little while a false frail brute shall go,
    From low to high, being quickly raised,
    By reason that he shall have the Government of _Verona_,
    Shall be unfaithful and slippery.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth of a wicked person, who in a short time shall be from
a low degree exalted to a high one, by reason that those that have the
Government of _Verona_, shall be unfaithful and slippery. That person
seemeth to be some Pope, who from a low degree shall be exalted to that
dignity, by the unfaithfulness and slipperiness of the _Venetians_, who
are now Lords of the City _Verona_ in _Italy_.


XIII.

    French.

    Les exiles, par ire, haine intestine,
    Feront au Roy grand conjuration,
    Secret mettront ennemis par la mine,
    Et les vieux siens, contre eux sedition.

    English.

    The banished, by choler, and intestine hatred
    Shall make against the King a great conspiracy,
    They shall put secret enemies in the mine,
    And the old his own against them sedition.

ANNOT.

Although this Prophecie seemeth to be indefinitely spoken, because in
every Countrey or Kingdom where there is banished people, they most
commonly plot against their King and Countrey; nevertheless I find two
remarkable Histories to make this good, one in _France_, and the other in
_England_. That of _France_ is thus.

The Cardinal of _Lorrain_, and the Duke of _Guise_ his Brother, being
in great favour with _Henry_ II. the Queen Mother promoted them in the
beginning of the Reign of _Francis_ II. his successor, so that the
Cardinal was made Lord high Treasurer, and the Duke General of the
Armies, to the prejudice of the Constable of _Montmorency_. Those two
favourites, fearing the persecution that is raised by envy, did remove
all the great ones from the Court, whether they were commanded to do so,
or whether they had any other pretences.

The Princes of _Condé_, and of _la Roche sur yon_, were sent into
_Flanders_ to _Philip_ II. _Condé_, to confirm the alliance between the
two Crowns, and _la Roche sur yon_ to carry the Order of _France_.

_Diana_ of _Poitiers_ Dutchess of _Valentenois_, was banished from Court,
and compelled to surrender to the Queen all the Jewels she had extorted
from the King, besides the Castle of _Chenonceaux_, which the Queen took
for her self.

The Marshal St. _Andrew_ was likewise banished from the Court. The King
of _Navarre_ was in _Bearn_.

The Constable took also his leave, and surrendred to the King the Seal
of his Office. On the other side, the Protestants began to stir notably,
having on their part many Princes, as that of _Condé_, of _Porcien_,
_Gaspard_, of _Coligny_, Admiral of _France_, d’_Andelot_, and the
Cardinal of _Chastillon_ his brothers, _Magdalene_ of _Mailly_, their
Sister, Lady of _Roye_, the King of _Navarre_. All these discontented
persons, and the Protestants made a great conspiracy under pretence of
Religion, and of freeing the King from the tyranny of the _Guisians_.

They did by _Choler_, the Protestants because they had been so ill
used, in the time of _Francis_ I. and _Henry_ II. and lately by the
_Guisians_. And the discontented, for to pull down their power, it was
also by an _intestine hatred_, because the Constable could not brook to
be dispossessed of his Office of great Master, which was given to the
Duke of _Guise_; and the others to see themselves from the management of
Affairs, and the Protestants by the spirit of a contrary Religion.

Their _conspiracy_ tended to expel the _Guisians_, and to seise upon the
Queen, the King, and his Brothers.

To compass their end, they secretly sent some trusty persons of their
own, who nevertheless feigned to be their Enemies; insomuch that the King
of _Navarre_ sent them word, that he would be always of their party,
though apparently he took the Courts part.

But _the Old his own_, saith the fourth Verse, that is to say, the Kings
old friends shall raise _Sedition_ against them, which happened in the
year 1650. when the _Guisians_ having discovered the conspiracy that was
made at _Nantes_, the 1. of _February_ 1560. whose chief Ring-leader was
the Lord _La Renaudie_; they presently got the King out of _Blois_, and
carryed him to _Amboise_, caused the Town to be fortified, and set strong
Guards upon all the passages.

The day appointed for the execution of the conspiracy at _Blois_, was the
10th of _March_: But the King being got to _Amboise_, the Conspirators
went thither in such great numbers, and under such specious pretences,
that had they not been betrayed, no body would have suspected them.
All the Suburbs and the Countrey Towns thereabouts were full of them.
The Prince of _Condé_, the Admiral, d’_Andelot_, and his Brother the
Cardinal, were all there.

Then the _Guisians_ began to fall to work, and to set upon the
Conspirators on all sides.

Abundance were taken, some in the City, some in the Suburbs, others in
the Countrey round about.

Most of these were slain before they could come to Town, or be carried
to Prison. And their process was so short that they were hanged in their
Boots and Spurs.

The Scouts did every where kill those they met withall. To conclude, it
proved a very Bloody Tragedy.

_La Renaudie_ the Chief of the Conspirators, was met with by the Lord
_Pardaillan_ a _Gascon_. At the first approach _La Renaudie_ killed him;
but himself was killed by _Pardeillan_’s Servant, and his dead body
brought and hanged at _Amboise_.

The second History is concerning _England_, which palpably makes this
Prophecie good, if we make reflection upon what hath happened in this
last Century of years, concerning banished people that have conspired
against their King and Countrey, as we may see through all the Life of
Queen _Elizabeth_, and by that famous Plot of the Gun-powder-Treason in
King _James_’s time, which must be understood here by the _Mine_.


XIV.

    French.

    De gens esclave, chansons, chants, & requestes,
    Captifs par Princes, & Seigneurs aux prisons,
    A l’advenir par Idiots sans testes,
    Seront receus par divins oraisons.

    English.

    From slavish people, Songs, Tunes and requests,
    Being kept Prisoners by Princes and Lords,
    For the future by headless Idiots,
    Shall be admitted by divine prayers.

ANNOT.

This is a prognostication of the beginning and increase of the
Protestants in _France_, who began to sing their Psalms in _French_, and
from time to time presented their request for tolleration. The Author
being a zealous Papist calleth them _Idiots_, and that notwithstanding
the persecution that should be against them, being put in Prison by
_Princes_ and _Lords_, they should at last be admitted by reason of their
often praying to God.


XV.

    French.

    _Mars_ nous menace par la force bellique,
    Septante fois fera le sang respandre,
    Auge & ruine de l’Ecclesiastique,
    Et par ceux qui d’eux rien ne voudront entendre.

    English.

    _Mars_ threatneth us of a Warlike force,
    Seventy times he shall cause blood to be shed,
    The flourishing and ruine of the Clergy,
    And by those that will hear nothing from them.

ANNOT.

The Author having premonished us in his Preface, that God having imparted
to him the knowledge of many future things, he was curious to know if
his Divine Majesty had written the same thing in the Cœlestial Book,
as concerning the States, Empires, Monarchies, Provinces and Cities,
and he found that it was even so as it had been revealed to him, so
that the Book of Heaven, written with Gods own hand, in so many shining
Characters, might serve to studious men for a light and a Torch to
discover very near the common estate of the world.

He then having learned from God in his solitariness, the prosperities
and afflictions of the Clergy, from the beginning of the year 1555. to
the end of the world; he found that there was an agreement between his
prophetical Knowledge, and the motion of the Heavenly Bodies; because
having made the Systeme of the years after 1550. he found that _Mars_ was
in a dangerous Aspect to the Ecclesiastical estate, and found that this
Planet by its position did presage a long, bloody and horrid Catastrophe
in the world, by which the Ecclesiastical estate should suffer much.

To make good this prediction, the Author doth assure us in his Preface,
that he had considered the disposition of this Planet, not only in the
year 1555. but also in the years following, and joyning together all
that he had found in his Ephemerides, he found that this Planet did on
all sides presage most bloody actions. Although, saith he, the Planet
of _Mars_ maketh an end of its course, and is come to its last Period:
nevertheless it will begin it again, but some gathered in _Aquarius_ for
many years, and others by long and continual years.

As if he would say that his prediction ought not to be rejected; because
_Mars_ ended his course, and cometh to its late period; for it would take
again its Exaltation and Dominion with a worse conjunction, having his
Astronomical dignities, with the Conjunction of other Planets in the Sign
of _Aquarius_ during many years, and in the Sign of _Cancer_ for many
years more.

Which maketh the Author conclude, that within the space of 177. years,
three months and eleven dayes, the world shall be afflicted with Wars,
Plagues, Famines and Innundations, that scarce any body shall be left to
Till the Ground. By which prediction we learn that those evils began in
the year 1555. the first of _March_, which is the date of the Authors
Book, and shall last till the second of _June_ 1732. abating the ten days
of the Gregorian Calender.

During which time, he saith, that _Mars_ threatneth us with bloody Wars
that shall be reiterated 70 times.

This word seventy doth not signifie a determinate number, but a great
number indeterminated according to the Phrase of the Scripture, which
by the number of seven signifieth many times, and by that of seventy
incomparably many times more. Thus the Scripture saith, that the just man
falleth seven times in one day, that is many times, and our Saviour saith
to St. _Peter_, that we ought to forgive our Enemies, not only seven
times, but seventy times seven; that is innumerable times.

We have found the truth of this Prophecie to this very day. 1. In
_France_, by the Wars between _Henry_ II. and _Charles_ V. and _Philip_
II. 2. By the Wars of _Charles_ IX. against the Protestants, wherein
so much blood was spilt on both sides. 3. By _Henry_ III. against
the same Protestants, and factions of his time, and then against the
_Parisians_ and others of their league. 4. Between _Henry_ IV. and
those of the league in his revolted Kingdom. 5. By the Wars of _Lewis_
XIII. against the Protestants, against the Duke of _Savoy_, in the
_Valteline_, in _Piemont_, in _Lorrain_, in _Alsatia_, in _Catalonia_, in
_Franche-Conty_, in _Flanders_, and for the defence of _Portugal_, which
have been continued by his successor _Lewis_ XIV. now Reigning.

_Italy_ did also find the truth of this prophecie, by the Wars between
_Paul_ IV. and the _Spaniard_, between _Pius_ V. and the _Turks_, between
_Clement_ VIII. and the Duke of _Ferrara_, between the Emperour and the
Duke of _Mantua_, between _Urban_ VIII. and the Duke of _Parma_, between
the _Venetians_ and the _Florentines_, by the revolt of the Kingdom of
_Naples_, under the conduct of the Duke of _Guise_.

_England_ hath had its share of it under Queen _Elizabeth_, by the revolt
of _Yorkshire_, and some other Provinces, by the _Spanish_ fleet of 88.

By the death of Queen _Mary_, by the revolt of the Kingdom against
_Charles_ I. And by the horrid perfidiousness of _Cromwel_.

_Germany_ hath made it good by the War against the _Turks_, the
Protestants and the _Swedes_.

_Poland_ hath done the same against the _Russians_, _Tartars_, _Turks_,
_Cassaks_ and _Swedes_.

And _Venice_ against the _Turk_, for the Islands of _Cyprus_ and
_Candia_, the Battle of _Lepanto_, and the Wars of _Dalmatia_.

This _Mars_ besides presageth two contrary things, one is the _Auge_
or Exaltation, the other the _ruine of the Clergy_: where it is to be
observed, the _Auge_ in tearms of Astrology signifieth mounting or
ascending, and cometh from the Latin _verbe augere_, which signifieth to
augment or increase. This augmentation and ruine of the _Clergy_ is made
good by the several changes that have been in the Ecclesiastical estate,
in _France_, _England_, Low-Countreys, _Denmark_, _Swede_, _Poland_,
_Hungary_, _Valachia_, _Transylvania_, _Moldavia_, _Dalmatia_, _Geneva_,
_Switzerland_, &c.

The fourth Verse saith. By those that will hear nothing from them: that
is, by the Protestants that will hear nothing from the _Roman_ Catholicks.


XVI.

    French.

    Faux a l’Estang, joint vers la _Sagittaire_,
    En son haut _Auge_ de l’Exaltation,
    Peste, Famine, mort de main Militaire,
    Le Siecle approcher de renovation.

    English.

    The Sith to the Fish-pond, joyned to _Sagittarius_,
    In the highest _Auge_ of the Exaltation,
    Plague, Famine, Death by a Military hand,
    The age groweth near to its renovation.

ANNOT.

The sense of all this is, that when a Meadow that was a _Fish-pond_
before, shall be Mowed, the Sign of _Sagittarius_ being in its _Auge_ or
ascendant, then shall _Plague_, _Famine_, and _War_ Reign, and that age
(which a Century of years shall be near its end and renovation _viz._ of
another Century.)


XVII.

    French.

    Par quarante ans l’Iris n’apparoistra,
    Par quarante ans tous les jours sera veu,
    La Terre aride en siccité croistra,
    Et grand deluge quand sera apparceu.

    English.

    During fourty years the Rainbow shall not appear,
    During fourty years it shall be seen every day.
    The parched Earth shall wax dryer and dryer,
    And great Flouds shall be when it shall appear.

ANNOT.

The Interpretation of this is easie, and signifieth nothing else but that
during 40. years the _Rainbow_ shall not be seen, and during that time
there shall be an exceeding great drought upon the Earth, and that for
40. years after the _Rainbow_ shall be seen every day, which shall cause
great flouds and innundations.


XVIII.

    French.

    Par la discorde, negligence _Gauloise_,
    Sera passage a _Mahomet_ ouvert,
    De sang trempé la Terre & Mer _Senoise_,
    Le Port _Phocen_ de Voiles & Nefs couvert.

    English.

    Through the discord and negligence of the _French_,
    A passage shall be opened to _Mahomet_,
    The Land and Sea of _Sienna_ shall be bloody,
    The _Phocen_ Haven shall be covered with Sails and Ships.

ANNOT.

In the year 1559. _Sultan Solyman_ called _Leonclavius_, according to the
alliance made between him and _Francis_ I. King of _France_, was desired
by _Henry_ II. his Son to send him some succours: Whereupon he sent
some of his Gallies to scour the _Tyrrhenean_ Sea (otherwise the Sea of
_Tuscany_) to give a diversion to the _Spanish_ forces in _Italy_, while
the King by the means of the Marshal of _Brissac_, should continue his
Conquests in the _Piemont_ and _Milanese_.

All what this _Turkish_ Fleet did, was to plunder and over-run the
Island of _Elbe_, and to attempt _Piombino_ without effect; and because
these places were seated upon the Sea of _Sienna_, called in Latin _Mare
Tirrhenum_, the Author saith that both the Land and Sea of _Sienna_ shall
be died with Blood, and at that time the Haven of _Marseilles_, which
was called by the Ancients, Port-_Phocen_ was full of Sales and Ships,
as well to go into the Island of _Corse_, as for other designs. This
History makes good that _Stanza_ which saith, that through the _discord_
and _negligence_ of the _French_, a passage shall be opened to _Mahomet_,
wherein it is to be observed that the Marshal of _Brissac_ doing wonders
for the King in _Piemont_, his virtue got him abundance of enviers and
enemies in the Kings Councel, which was the cause of a great discord
among them, by the diversity of opinions, and this diversity was the
cause of a prodigious negligence in sending to him relief, as _Turpin_
witnesseth in his History of _Naples_, and _Paradin_ in the continuation
of his History.

By this discord and negligence, _a passage was opened to Mahomet_, his
Fleet going freely upon the _Mediterranean_ Sea near the Coasts of
_France_. And the reason of it was, because this discord and negligence
did compel _Henry_ the II. to ask succours of _Solyman_, that the
_Spaniard_ might be compelled to divide his Forces in sending some to the
Sea-Towns, and so should not be so strong in _Piemont_; and thus must be
understood the _French discord and negligence_, in the first and second
Verse. As for the many Sails and Ships that were then in the Haven of
_Marseilles_, to go into the Island of _Corsica_, the following Stanza’s
are full of predictions concerning it.


XIX.

    French.

    Lors que Serpens viendront circuir l’Air,
    Le sang _Troien_ versé par les _Espagnes_,
    Par eux: grand nombre en sera fait tare,
    Chef fuit, caché aux Marets dans les saignes.

    English.

    When Serpents shall come to encompass the Are,
    The _Trojan_ blood shall be vexed by _Spain_,
    By them, a great number shall perish,
    Chief runneth away, and is hid in the rushes of the Marishes.

ANNOT.

By the _Serpents_, the Author being a Roman Catholick, meaneth the
Protestants, who then began to appear numerous in the Reigns of _Francis_
the I. and _Henry_ the II. in whose time the Admiral _Coligny_ was the
chief among them, for his great feats in War.

These Serpents or Protestants begun to encompass the _Are_, that is to
say, the Church and the Altar, which in Latin is called _Ara_.

And that happened when _the Trojan-blood was vexed by Spain_. By the
_Trojan-blood_, the Author meaneth the _French_ blood, according to the
vulgar opinion, that the _French_ are descended from the _Trojans_.
The _French_ were then vexed by the _Spaniards_, at the Battle of St.
_Laurence_, and at the taking of St. _Quentin_, and other places in the
Year 1557.

The third Verse saith _by them_, that is, by the Protestants _a great
number shall perish_, that is to say, a great number of _French_. Among
whom the Admiral of _Chatillon_ having done what was possible to be done
at the defence of St. _Quentin_, and seeing the Town taken, run away
with three more, and hid himself among the Rushes that are in the Boggs
about the Town, where he was found, and carried Prisoner to the Duke of
_Savoy_, who received him very honorably, according to his valour and
deserts.

Observe that the word _Saignes_ here signifieth in old _Provencal_ a
_Marish_.

    English.

    _Tours_, _Orleans_, _Blois_, _Angers_, _Renes_, and _Nantes_,
    Cities vexed by a sudden change,
    By strange Languages Tents shall be set up,
    Rivers, Darts, _Rennes_, Land, and Sea shall quake.

ANNOT.

All the Cities mentioned in the first Verse are seated by the River
of _Loire_, and are threatned here of a sudden change, and that some
strangers shall set up their Tents against them, and chiefly at _Rennes_,
there shall be an Earth-quake felt both by Sea and Land.

    A deep white clay feedeth a Rock,
    Which clay shall break out of the deep like milk,
    In vain people shall be troubled not daring to touch it,
    Being ignorant that in the bottom there is a milky clay.

ANNOT.

It is a Rock in the middle of the Sea, whose Roots are fed by a white
clay, which is at the foot of this Rock, in the bottom of the Sea, and
therefore called deep.

This clay being softned, and dissolved by the Sea-water, shall appear
upon the superficies of it like milk about the Rock. Those that shall see
this wonder, _being ignorant that in the bottom there is a milky clay_,
shall in vain be troubled at it, and shall not dare to touch it.

    The Lion shall destroy the art of it,
    _Autun_, _Chalons_, _Langres_, and both _Sens_,
    The War and the Ice shall do great harm.

ANNOT.

This is a great Riddle, which was never found out till now; and had I not
been born in the Countrey where the History did happen, it might have
been unknown to this day, and buried in oblivion.

[Sidenote: _The History of a λιθοπαίδιον or petrified child_.]

In the year of the Lord 1613. which was that of my Birth. There was in
the Town of _Sens_ a Taylors Wife named _Columba Chatry_, who presently
after her marriage conceived, and for the space of 28. years persuaded
her self to be with Child, had all the signs of it in the beginning of
her impregnation, and having gone her compleat time, she begun to feel
the pains of a woman in Labour, with great gripings in the Guts. The
Urine was suppressed for a while, but at last it broke out with a strong
current. This quantity of water not coming so much out of the Bladder as
was supposed, as from the womb, by the breaking of the Membrane, called
_Amnion_, seeing that with those serous excrements, she avoided some
conjealed blood. After that her breast begun to fall, and the Child had
little or no motion, her pains being less than they were, which caused
no small admiration to the Midwifes, who expected a safe deliverance.
For the space of three years after, this woman kept her Bed, and was
brought to Deaths door, complaining of gripings and a hard swelling,
which she desired all the Physitians and Chyrurgeons to feel, having
lost all appetite, but that little which she recovered by the use of
sharp things, as Verjuice, Lemmons, _&c._ she was wont to say to her
Neighbours, that she bare a Child that should be the cause of her death.
After she was dead, her Husband got two experienced Chyrurgeons to open
her body, who having opened the belly, and taken away the _Peritonæum_,
saw the Womb of several colours, as the flesh that is about the head and
neck of a Turky-cock, but as it were of a Horny substance. They begun to
make an incision in it with a Rasour, but finding it resisted the edge,
they begun to use their Incision knives with all their strength; at last
one of them by chance hit the Scull, and after that some Ribs, and then
the Shoulder bone, by which, knowing that there was bones contained in
that lump, with greater strength they made a deeper incision, and having
parted the edges of the womb, saw in the bottom of the womb a Child,
wrapped in the membrane, called _Allantoides_; at which the Chyrugeons
wondering, sent for the Physitians to have their opinion in a thing that
is almost beyond belief; in the mean time people flocking thither from
all parts, and troubling the Chyrurgeons in their operation; they thought
good to take away with their Instruments all that Lump, as a Tree from
its Roots, and to carry it home, that they might with more time and
leasure examine the whole Anatomy of it. In that hasty pulling out of the
Child, they had no time to observe what Chorion it had, what umbilical
Vessels, and what connexion there was of the Allantoides with the Womb,
and with the Child, chiefly about the right hip, the Buttocks, and the
Back-bone being all grown solid together.

The scituation of the Child was almost _Spherical_, the face leaning upon
the breast, and the Nostrils upon the Knees; the bones of the Head were
but thin, but very hard, and shining like Horn; the skin of the Head
was hairy in many places; the head did hang so much upon the left arm,
that the Ear, and part of the skull had given way to the Shoulder-bone;
the Elbow was bent towards the Shoulder stretching only his hand, which
was so close shut, and the fingers sticking so fast to the Palm of it,
that although they did appear distinct one from another, nevertheless it
was all but one and the same stone; the right arm did stretch its hand
towards the Navel, which unadvisedly was broken by the wrist, and left
in the Mothers Belly; the left Thigh, Knee and Leg were on the top of
the right ones, with which they were so entangled, that the left heel,
and the sole of the foot were planted upon the right foot, who seemed
to have given place to them, and were almost inseparably joyned; for all
such hardness of the matter, the body was not less than that of other
Children of the same age, but kept a perfect fulness and proportion
all the internal parts, as the Brains, the Heart, the Liver, had their
natural shape, and were not altogether so hard as the external parts, so
that to this very day this little body defieth all kind of corruption.

This Child was kept in my time by one Mr. _Michel_ a Chirurgion of
_Sens_, who kindly shewed it to all the strangers that came far and near
to see it. The Fame of it was so great, that Doctor _Mayerne_ coming from
_Switzerland_ to _England_, took his way through _Sens_ to see it, and
would have perswaded King _Charles_ I. to buy it, as himself told me;
since that I hear it was fallen into the hands of the _Venetians_. In
this History there is two observable wonders. One, that the Child dying
in the Womb, did not corrupt, and so cause the death of its Mother. The
other, by what vertue or power of the body this child was petrified,
seeing that the Womb is a hot and moist place, and therefore more subject
to putrifaction. Those that will satisfie themselves with the reasons of
it, and the truth of the History, may read _Johannes Alibosius_ Physician
of _Sens_, who was an eye witness of it, and _Sennertus_ in his book of
Sympt. _quam feminis in utero accidant_.

Now this accident being so rare, and without parallel, our Author
thought fit to foretel it, and to cover it in abscure tearms, that he
might not appear ridiculous in so admirable an event. When therefore he
saith, _That which shall live and shall have no Sense_, he meaneth this
λιθοπαίδιον or child petrified, which had a Life while it was in the
Mothers belly, being tied to it by the several Vessels and connexions,
known to Anatomists, and yet was senseless in that it was petrified. When
in the second verse he saith, _The Iron shall destroy the art of it_, he
meaneth that it should be spoiled by the rasour, in the two last verses
he saith, that the Towns of _Autun_, _Chalons_, _Langres_, and _Sens_ the
Town in which this did happen should that same year suffer much damage by
Hail and Ice, which did come to pass, as many persons may justify in that
Countrey, that are alive to this day.

    English.

    In the third month at the rising of the Sun,
    The Boar and Leopard in _Marth_ camp to fight;
    The Leopard weary, lift his eyes to Haven,
    And seeth an Eagle playing about the Sun.

ANNOT.

This signifieth a particular accident, _viz._ that in the third Month,
which is that of _March_, at the rising of the _Sun_, the _Boar_ and the
_Leopard_, that is, two persons of quality hidden under these names,
shall go into the fields to fight a Duel. The _Leopard_ one of them being
weary, shall lift up his eyes to Heaven, calling upon God, and thereupon
shall see an _Eagle_ playing about the _Sun_, that is, shall get the
Victory, of which the _Eagle_ is the Emblem.

    French.

    A Cité nevue pensif pour condamner,
    Loisel de proie au ciel se vient offrir,
    Apres Victoire a Captifs pardonner
    _Cremone_ & _Mantoue_ grands maux auront souffert.

    English.

    In the new City for to condemn a Prisoner,
    The Bird of pray shall offer himself to Heaven,
    After the Victory, the Prisoners shall be forgiven,
    After _Cremona_ and _Mantua_ have suffered many troubles.

ANNOT.

This name of new City is appropriated to several ones in every Countrey.
The _French_ have many _Villeneufuas_, the Germans many _Newstads_, the
_Italians_ and _Spaniards_ many _Villanovas_, so that it is hard to guess
which of them the Author meaneth. The missing of this dore makes the rest
of the Prophecie so obscure, that I had rather leave it to the liberty of
the Reader, than to pretend a true explication of it. I shall only say,
that _Cremona_ and _Mantua_ are two famous Towns in _Italy_, which are
here threatned.


XXV.

    French.

    Perdu, trouvé, caché de si long siecle

    Lost, found again, hidden so great a while,
    A Pastor as Deme-God shall be honoured;
    But before the Moon endeth her great Age,
    By other winds he shall be dishonoured.

ANNOT.

The Prophecie is concerning the body of a famous Churchman, which was
lost, and shall be found again, and worshiped as a _Demy-God_, but before
the _Moon_ hath run her great age, which is of 13 Months, it shall be
vilified and dishonoured.

    English.

    The great Man falleth by the Lightning in the day time,
    An evil foretold by a common Porter;
    According to this foretelling another falleth in the night,
    A fight at _Rhemes_, and the Plague at _London_ and _Tuscany_.

ANNOT.

This is concerning some great man, who being premonished by a common
Carrier not to travel upon a certain day, did slight the advice, and was
strucken by Lightning in the day time, and another in the night; at the
same time there was a fight at _Rhemes_, and the Plague at _London_ and
in _Tuscany_, which in Latin is called _Etruria_.

    French.

    Des soubs le Chesne _Guyen_ du Ciel frappé,
    Non loin de la est caché le Thresor,

    English.

    Under the Oak _Guyen_ strucken from Heaven,
    Not far from it is the Treasure hidden,
    Which hath been many Ages a gathering;
    Being found he shall die, the eye put out by a spring.

ANNOT.

The sense of it is, that some body (who is named here _Guyen_) being
under an Oak shall be strucken with the lightning, and that near that
place there is a great Treasure, that hath been many years a gathering,
and that he who shall find it shall die, being shot in the eye with a
Fire-lock.

    English.

    The Tower of _Bouk_ shall be in fear of a Barbarian Fleet,
    For a while, and long after afraid of _Spanish_ shipping,
    Flocks, peoples, goods both shall receive great damage,
    _Taurus_ and _Libra_, O what a deadly feud.

ANNOT.

The Tower of _Bouk_ is a strong place seated by the _Rhosne_, where it
entereth into the Mediterranean Sea; it is said here that it shall be in
fear of a Barbarian Fleet, and after that of a _Spanish_ one, and that
both the _Spaniard_ and the _French_ shall have great losses in Cattle,
People and Goods, and this shall happen when the Sun shall be in the
Signs of _Taurus_ and _Libra_.


XXIX.

    French.

    Quand le Poisson, Terrestre & _Aquatique_,

    English.

    When the Fish that is both Terrestrial and Aquatick,
    By a strong Wave shall be cast upon the Sand,
    With his strange fearful sweet horrid form,
    Soon after the enemies will come near to the Walls by Sea.

ANNOT.

This signifieth no more but that after, a Fish, Terrestrial and Aquatick,
that is which, liveth in Land and Water, called by the Greeks αμφίβιον,
shall be cast upon the Sand by a storm, then a little while after, that
Town which lieth near to that place where the Fish was cast, shall be
Besieged by her Enemies, who shall come by Sea.

    La Nef estrange par le tourment Marin,

    Apres mort, pille, bon advis tard venu.

    English.

    The Outlandish Ship by a Sea storm,
    Shall come near the unknown Haven,
    Notwitstanding the signs given to it with Bows,
    It shall die, be plundered, a good advice come too late.

ANNOT.

It is a Forrein Ship which by a storm shall be driven to an unknown
Harbour, and notwithstanding the signs that shall be made to it with
Branches, by those that are upon the Land to beware of the entrance of
the Harbour, it shall be cast away, and plundered; thus a good advice
shall come too late.


XXXI.

    French.

    Tant d’ans les guerres, en _Gaule_ dureront,
    Outre la course du _Castulon_ Monarque,
    Victoire incerte trois grands couroneront,
    Aigle, Coq, Lune, Lion Soleil en marque.

    English.

    So many years the Wars shall last in _France_,
    Beyond the course of the _Castulon_ Monarque,
    An uncertain Victory three great ones shall Crown,
    The Eagle, the Cock, the Moon, the Lion having the Sun in its mark.

ANNOT.

That is, the Wars shall last so long in _France_ after the death of one
King of _Spain_, till three great ones shall challenge an uncertain
Victory, these three great ones are the Emperour designed by the Aigle,
the King of _France_ by the Cock, and the _Turk_ by the Moon, and this
shall happen when the Sun is in the sign of the Lion. I suppose that came
to pass in the time of _Charles_ the V. _Henry_ the II. and _Soliman_.
For the _Turk_ had no great odds upon the Emperour, nor he upon the King
of _France_.


XXXII.

    French.

    La grand Empire sera tost translaté,
    En lieu petit qui bien tost viendra croistre,
    Lieu bien infime d’exigue Comté,
    Ou au milieu viendra poser son Scepter.

    English.

    The great Empire shall soon be translated,
    Into a little place which shall soon grow afterwards.
    An inferiour place of a small County,
    In the middle of which he shall come to lay down his Scepter.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the same _Charles_ the V. Emperour, who about three
years before his death, being weary of the World, resigned his Dominions
of _Spain_ and of the _Low-Countries_, to his Son _Philip_ the II.
and his Empire to his Brother _Ferdinand_, and retired himself into a
Monastery of _Castile_, called l’_Escurial_, which after his death, was
much enlarged and beautified by his Son _Philip_: and that is the meaning
of our Author when he saith:

    _Into a little place which shall soon grow afterwards,_
    _An inferiour place of a small County,_

For this _Escurial_ being seated in a Desert place of a County of
_Spain_, called _Castilia_, which the _Spanish_ vanity calleth a Kingdom,
(whose Use, Fruit, or Revenues, the said _Charles_ only reserved for his
maintenance) is now by the _Spaniards_ accounted to be the eighth wonder
of the World.

    English.

    A great Bridge near a spacious Plain,
    The great Lion by _Cæsarean_ Forces,
    Shall cause to be pulled down, without the rigorous City,
    For fear of which, the Gates shall be shut to him.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that a great Captain, Commander of the Imperial
Forces, shall cause a Bridge that was built near a spacious Plain to be
thrown down. The City near the Bridge being terrified at it, shall shut
up their Gates against him.


XXXIV.

    French.

    English.

    The Bird of Prey flying to the Window,
    Before Battle, shall appear to the _French_;
    One shall take a good omen of it, the other a bad one,
    The weaker part shall hold it for a good sign.

ANNOT.

It is a Hawk which in presence of two Armies ready to give Battle,
shall fly to a window and perch upon it, in the presence of them all,
one of the Armies shall take it for a good sign; and the other, for an
ambiguous and sinister one. In Conclusion, the weaker party shall get the
Victory.


XXXV.

    French.

    Le Lion jeune le vieux surmontera,
    En champ bellique par singulier Duelle,
    Dans Cage dor Lœil il lui crevera,
    Deux playes une puis mourir mort cruelle.

    English.

    The young Lion shall overcome the old one,
    In Martial field by a single Duel,
    In a Golden Cage he shall put out his Eye,
    Two wounds from one, then he shall die a cruel death.

ANNOT.

This is one of the Prophecies that hath put our Author in credit, as well
for the clearness as for the true event of it.

_Cæsar Nostradamus_ our Authors son, in his History of _Provence_,
writeth that by this _Stanza_ his father intended to foretell the manner
of _Henry_ the second’s death.

The _French_ Histories relate that this great Prince desiring to honour
the Nuptial of his Daughter _Elizabeth_, married to _Philip_ II. King of
_Spain_, did appoint a Tournament to be kept in St. _Anthony_’s street in
_Paris_, where himself would be one of the Defendants against all comers,
and for that purpose chose for his companions and associates _Don Alfonso
d’Este_ Duke of _Ferrara_, and _Francis_ of _Lorrain_, Duke of _Guise_.

The Tornament being almost ended, in which the King had shewed much
Valour being mounted upon a Horse of the Duke of _Savoy_, _Philibert_’s,
_Emanuel_ his Brother in Law, this Duke intreated the King to leave off,
because he had got the Victory; and the weather was hot, and the night
drawing on: But this Martial King would need break one Launce more, and
commanded the Captain _Gabriel de Lorges_ to be called, a young and
valiant Lord and Captain of the _Scottish_ Guard. Being come, the King
commanded him to run against him, which he refused a great while; but the
King waxing angry, he obeyed, and set Spurs to his Horse, he did hit the
King in the lower part of his Beaver, the Launce was broken into shivers,
and the mean stump lifting up the Beaver, a splinter got in, and wounded
the King a little above the right _Eye_, where finding the Bone too hard,
it went very deep under the said _Eye_, and broke some Veins belonging to
the Membrane, called _Pia Mater_.

The blow was so violent that the King bended his head towards the lists,
and fell, into a Swound, being presently disarmed, they perceived the
splinter of the Launce in his _Eye_, and his face all bloody. He lived
ten days after, and died with great Convulsions, because the Sinews were
offended, whereupon he suffered grievous Torment.

His death was also foretold by _Luke Gaurick_ a great Astrologer, who
being constrained by the Queen _Catharine_ of _Medicis_, to tell her by
what kind of death her Husband should end his days, told her it should
be in a _Duel_, which made him to be hissed at, Kings being exempted of
those accidents.

According to this Narrative the Author calleth the King an old _Lion_,
and the Captain _Lorges_, since Earl of _Montgomery_, the _young Lion_;
because both fought like _Lions_. The _young Lion_ overcame the old one
in _Martial field_, and in a fight of one against one, and consequently a
_Duel_.

He overcame him by putting his _Eye_ out in a _Golden Cage_, that is, in
his Gilded Helmet.

Of which _Wound_ there came another, because the blood of some broken
Veins, creeping into the Brains by the vehement agitation of the head,
caused an Impostume there, which could not be remedied: therefore the
Author saith _two Wounds_ from one, that is, one wound made two: and the
King died of a cruel death, as we have said before.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Tard le Monarque se viendra repentir,
    De navoir mis a Mort son Adversaire,
    Mais viendra bien a plus haut consentir,
    Que tout son sang par Mort sera deffaire.

    English.

    The Monarque shall too late repent,
    That he hath not put to death his Adversary;
    But he shall give his consent to a greater thing than that,
    Which is to put to death all his Adversaries Kindred.

ANNOT.

The words of this are plain, though it be questionable whether the thing
is come to pass already, or not.


XXXVII.

    French.

    Un peu devant que le Soleil sabsconse,
    Conflict donné, grand peuple dubieux,
    Profligez, Port-Marin ne fait responce,
    Pont & Sepulchre en deux estranges lieux.

    English.

    A little before the Sun setteth,
    A Battle shall be given, a great people shall be doubtful,
    Of being foiled, the Sea-Port maketh no answer,
    A Bridge and Sepulchre shall be in two strange places.

ANNOT.

The two first verses I believe are concerning the Battle of Saint
_Denis_, which was fought in the Evening hard by _Paris_, and where the
Constable of _Montmorency_ was kill’d, which made that great people of
_Paris_ to be doubtful.

The other two Verses I leave to the interpretation of the Reader.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    Le Sol & l’Aigle Victeur paroistront,
    Response vain au vaincu lon asseure,
    Par Cor ne cris, harnois narresteront,
    Vindicte paix, par Mort lacheve a l’heure.

    English.

    The Sun and the Eagle shall appear to the Victorious,
    A vain Answer shall be made good to the vanquished,
    By no means Arms shall not be stopped,
    Vengeance maketh Peace, by death he then accomplisheth it.

ANNOT.

This Stanza being full of Figures and Equivoques, I will not interpose my
Judgement in it, lest I undertake too much, and perform too little.


XXXIX.

    French.

    De nuit dans le lit le supresme estranglé,
    Pour avoir trop suborné blond esleu,
    Par trois l’Empire subroge Exancle,
    A mort mettra, Carte ne Pacquet leu.

    English.

    By night in the bed the chief one shall be strangled.
    For having too much suborned fair Elect,
    By three the Empire subrogate Exancle,
    He shall put him to death, reading neither Card nor Packet.

ANNOT.

The Author hath purposely obscured this Prophecie in the third Verse,
to take away the Knowledge of it from the Reader; because the parties
concerned were then alive, _viz._ _Philip_ II. King of _Spain_, who
caused his only son _Don Carlo_ to be strangled in his bed, for suspicion
of being too familiar with his wife _Elizabeth_ of _France_, and Daughter
to _Henry_ II. The last Verse saith, that he was so implacable, that he
would read neither _Card_ nor _Packet_, that is, no requests.


XL.

    French.

    La tourbe fausse dissimilant folie,
    Fera _Bizance_ un changement de loix,
    Istra d’_Ægypt_ qui veus que l’on deslie,
    Edict, changant Monnoys & alloys.

    English.

    The false Troup dissembling their folly,
    Shall make in _Bizance_ an alteration of _Laws_.
    One shall come out of _Ægypt_ who will have untied
    The Edict, changing the Coin and allay.

ANNOT.

There is two things in this Prognostication, the first that in _Bizance_,
which is _Constantinople_, a _Troop_ of tumultuous persons gathered
together, and dissembling their folly, shall cause an alteration in the
_Laws_.

The other, that some _Bassa_ come out of _Ægypt_, shall perswade them at
_Constantinople_ to alter their _Coin_, and the allay of it.


XLI.

    French.

    Siege a Cité & de nuit assaille,
    Peu eschapez non loing de Mer conflict,
    Femme de joye, retour fils, de faillie,
    Poison & Lettres caché dedans le plie.

    English.

    A Siege laid to a City, and assaulted by night,
    Few escaped, a fight not far from the Sea,
    A woman swoundeth for joy to see her son returned;
    A poison hidden in the fold of Letters.

ANNOT.

After the taking of _Vulpian_, the _French_ came to _Montcalvo_, and in
the night surprized it by _Scalado_, and _Paradin_ saith, that not a drop
of Blood was shed on either side.

The Town being taken, the Citadel did hold out a good while, and at
last did surrender, _Don Arbre_, who was in the place of the Marques of
_Pescaire_, and of the Duke of d’_Alva_, knowing that the besieged had
not made a sufficient resistance, caused the Captain, and eleven more of
the chief ones to be hanged; because the place was of consequence, and
those within had not made a sufficient resistance.

The Author saith in the first Verse, Siege was laid to a City, that is,
it was resolved to besiege _Montcalvo_, as the Martial of _Brissac_ had
advised. In the execution it was assaulted by night, in the taking few
escaped; for they were all taken, and yielded to the Victorious. There
were none killed or wounded, all were taken, except few who ran away, and
carried the news to the _Spaniards_.

At the same time _a fight not far from the Sea_, that is, at the same
time there was another Battle by the Sea, between the _Spaniards_ and the
_Pope_, as we shall shew hereafter.

The third and fourth Verses are concerning a particular accident, which
happened presently after the taking of _Montcalvo_, which is, that a
woman seeing her Son come back safe, fell in a swound, or died for joy,
because knowing the danger wherein he was, she had lost all hopes of ever
seeing him. This fellow had brought Poison in a Letter to give to one
that had not rewarded him according to his desire. His wickedness being
discovered, his Master put him in Prison, whence he escaped, and came
back again to _Montcalvo_; the Author speaketh of the same in another
place, which we shall set down in its order.


XLII.

    French.

    Les dix Calendes d’_Avril_ de fait _Gothique_,
    Resuscité encor par gens malins,
    Le feu estaint, assemblée Diabolique,
    Cherchant les Os de _Damant_ & _Psellin_.

    English.

    The tenth of the Calends of _April_, _Gothik_ account,
    Raised up again by malitious persons,
    The fire put out, a Diabolical assembly,
    Shall seek for the Bones of _Damant_ and _Psellin_.

ANNOT.

The tenth of the Calends of _April_ is the 23. of _March_, _Gothik_
account signifieth the old account of the Calendar, before the
reformation of it by Pope _Gregory_ the XIII. which old account is called
here _Gothik_, because it is kept still by the Northern Nations, which do
not acknowledge the Pope, as _Sweden_, _Denmark_, _Holland_, _England_,
&c. at that time saith our Author, a Magician shall be raised up by
malitious persons; which fire or tumult being put out, that Diabolical
assembly will go about to seek the bones of two famous Magicians, _viz._
_Damant_ and _Psellin_ that were dead before.


XLIII.

    French.

    Avant qu’aviene le changement d’Empire,
    Il adviendra un cas bien merveilleux,
    Le Champ mué, le Pilier de _Porphyre_,
    Mis, translaté sur le Rocher Noileux.

    English.

    Before the change of the Empire cometh,
    There shall happen a strange accident,
    A field shall be changed, and a Pillar of _Prophyry_,
    Shall be transported upon the Chalky Rock.

ANNOT.

This will not seem incredible to those that have read the _English_
Chronicles, who relates that in a County of _England_ (I think it is
_Herefordshire_) there was an Earthquake, which transposed a large piece
of ground in another place, with the Trees that were in it, and if I
remember well, half a Chappel, those that have the Books may examine the
truth of the History, and satisfie themselves better.

    En bref seront de retour Sacrifices,
    Contrevenans seront mis a Martyre,
    Plus ne seront Moins, Abbez ne Novices,
    Le Miel sera beaucoup plus cher que Cire.

    English.

    Within a little while Sacrifices shall come again,
    Opposers shall be put to Martyrdom;
    There shall be no more Monks, Abbots, nor Novices,
    Honey shall be much dearer then Wax.

ANNOT.

This is a true Prophecy of the miserable condition of the Church and
Clergy in our Fore-fathers times, and chiefly of _Henry_ the II. in
_France_, and _Henry_ the VIII. in _England_, when in the beginning
of the Reformation there was such a confusion of opinions, and such
unsettledness in Ecclesiastical Government, that sometimes the Popish
party prevailed, and put to death the Opposers; at another time the
Protestants, who drove away the Monks, Abbots and Novices, as is
expressed here, and proved true in _Henry_ the VIII. time. As for what he
saith, that _Honey shall be much dearer than Wax_. It is to be understood
of the downfal of the Romish Religion, who maketh use of Wax Candles and
Tapers in their superstitious ceremonies, as if he would say, that the
Romish Religion being down, Wax shall be cheap, and Honey dear.

    A Beast upon the Theatre prepareth the Scenical play,
    The Inventor of that wicked fact shall be famous,
    By Sects the World shall be confounded and Schismatik.

ANNOT.

The Author being a Papist, is probable that in this Prophecy he aimed
at _Luther_, after whose coming the world hath been full of Sects and
Schisms.

    English.

    Near _Auch_, _Lectoure_ and _Mirande_,
    A great fire from Heaven shall fall three nights together,
    A thing shall happen stupendious and wonderful,
    A little while after, the Earth shall quake.

ANNOT.

_Auch_, _Lectoure_ and _Miranda_ are three Towns in _Guyenna_, a Province
of _France_, the chief City whereof is _Bourdeaux_. The rest is easie.

    The Sermons of the _Leman_ Lake shall be troublesome,
    Some days shall be reduced into weeks,
    Then into months, then into year, then they shall fail,
    The Magistrates shall condemn their vain Laws.

ANNOT.

The _Leman Lake_, in Latin _Lacus Lemanus_, is the Lake of _Geneva_,
therefore it is palpable, that by this Prophecy, the Author aimeth at
_Calvin_, and his Successors, who began the Reformation in that Town. I
leave the rest to the Readers Judgement, it is enough I have opened the
door.

    Twenty years of the Reign of the Moon being past,
    Seven thousands years another shall hold his Monarchy,

All this signifieth no more, but that the Authors Prophecies extend to
the end of the world.

    A great while before these doings,
    Those of the East by the virtue of the Moon,
    In the year _1700._ shall carry away great droves,
    And shall subdue almost the whole Northern corner.

ANNOT.

I desire Posterity to take special notice of this _Stanza_, that in case
it should come to pass, our Author may be admired for the specification
of the time, which is so punctually set down, here that it admitteth no
ambiguity. The plain meaning is, that the _Turks_, which he calleth those
of the East. By the virtue of the Moon, which is their Ensign and Badge,
shall in the year 1700. carry away abundance of people, and shall subdue
almost the whole Northern Countrey, which to them is _Russia_, _Poland_,
_Hungary_, _Sweden_, _Denemark_, &c.

    From the Aquatick triplicity shall be born,
    One that shall make _Thursday_ his Holiday,
    His Fame, Praise, Reign, and Power shall grow,
    By Land and Sea, and a Tempest to the East.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that at that time, as such conjunction of Planets shall
be, which he calleth here _Aquatick triplicity_, there shall be born upon
a _Thursday_ a famous man, such as he describeth here, who shall be a foe
and a terrour to the _Turks_, signified here by the _Orients_.

    O Eternal God, what changes shall there be!
    After a long age his wicked time cometh again,
    _France_ and _Italy_, what commotions?

This signifieth, that when _Jupiter_ and _Saturn_ shall be in conjunction
in the head of _Aries_, that then shall be great commotions in _France_
and _Italy_.

    English.

    The two malignants of _Scorpion_ being joyned,
    The grand Seignor murdered in his Hall,
    Plague to the Church by a King newly joyned to it,
    _Europe_ low, and Septentrional.

ANNOT.

This third position of the Celestial bodies foretelleth the death of the
great _Turk_, who should be murdered in his own Chamber, as happened
to Sultan _Osman_, who was strangled in his Chamber, by the command of
_Daout Bassa_ great Vizeir, about the year 1622. _vide_ the Turkish
History.

The rest of the Prophecy is concerning a King, who being newly joyned to
the Church, (I suppose of _Rome_) shall bring much mischief to it, and in
his time _Europe_ shall be brought very low, and in a manner confined to
a corner of the North, which hath relation to the foregoing 49. Stanza,
which see in its place.

    Alas, how a great people shall be tormented,
    And the Holy Law in an utter ruine;
    By other Laws, all Christendom troubled,
    When new Mines of Gold and Silver shall be found.

ANNOT.

This is a true Prophecy of the mischiefs that have happened in the
World by the finding of the Mines in _America_; first to the _Indians_
themselves, called here a great People, by the cruelty of the
_Spaniards_, and then to all Christendom besides, by the evils that this
Idol _Mammon_ hath brought into it.

    Two revolts shall be made by the wicked Link-carrier,
    Which shall make a change of the Reign and the Age,
    The moveable Sign doth offer it self for it,
    To the two equals in inclination.

ANNOT.

This obscure Stanza must be interpreted thus.

_Two revolts shall be made by the wicked Link-carrier_; that is, _Paris_
which is the _Link-carrier_ of _France_, and whose example the rest
of the Towns follow, shall revolt twice, the first revolt was against
_Henry_ III. in the time of the _Barricadoes_, the second against _Henry_
IV. his successor.

_Which shall make a change of the Reign and the Age_: This happened when
the house of _Valois_ was extinguished, and the house of _Bourbon_ came
in, and that is _the change of the Reign_. _The change of the Age_, was,
because this did happen about the end of the year 1599. and the beginning
1600. which was a _change of Age_.

_The moveable sign offers it self for it_: That is, the position of the
Heavens was such as to forward these accidents.

_To the two equals in ambition_: That is, to _Henry_ III. and _Henry_ IV.
who both intended, and went about to reduce _Paris_ to obedience.

    There shall be a great effusion of Blood.
    Insomuch that the Land, and Sea, Air and Heaven shall seem unjust
    Sects, Famine, Reigns, Plague, Confusion.

ANNOT.

There is nothing difficult here, but what _Climat_ is that is _opposite
to the Babylonian_, of which every body may satisfie himself by perusing
the Globe.

    You shall see soon or late great alterations
    Extreme horrours and revenges,
    The Moon leaden by her Angel,
    The Heaven draweth near its inclinations.

ANNOT.

I conceive there is some things omitted, and corrupted by the Press in
this Stanza, which rendreth it so difficult, therefore I had rather leave
it to the decision of the impartial Reader, than venture my opinion upon
it.

    By great discord, the Trumpet shall sound,
    Agreement broken, lifting the head to Heaven,
    A bloody mouth shall swim in blood,
    The face turned to the Sun anointed with Milk and Honey.

ANNOT.

The words and sence are plain, and I cannot believe that there is any
great mystery hidden under these words.


LVIII.

    French.

    Trenché le ventre, naistra avec deux testes,
    & quattre bras, quel qu’ans entiers vivra,
    Jour qu’Aquilare celebrera ses festes,
    _Fossan_, _Thurin_, chef _Ferrare_ fuiera.

    English.

    Slit in the belly, shall be born with two heads,
    And four Arms, it shall live some years,
    The day that _Aquilare_ shall celebrate his Festivals,
    _Fossan_, _Thurin_, chief _Ferrare_ shall run away.

ANNOT.

In the first Verse the Author speaketh of a Monster that had two heads,
and four Arms, and the Belly slit, that is to say, it was a female.

His Son _Cæsar_ in his History of _Provence_, saith, that in the Town of
_Senan_ in _Provence_, a Child was born with two heads, and that it was
foretold by some that were skilful in Astronomy, by which words I guess
he spake of his Father, sith the Astrologers cannot foretel the birth of
a particular Monster, and therefore _Nostradamus_ only was able to do it
in those days.

He saith in the same place, that it was born in _February_ 1554. and was
brought to _Salon_ to be shewed to his Father, and thence was carried to
_Claudius_ Earl of _Savoy_ Governour of _Provence_, who commonly had his
residence at _Salon_.

He maketh no mention if he had four Arms, nor what Sex it was of, it may
be that being in swadling cloths, nobody took notice of the Arms or Sex.

The Author Prophecieth that it should live some years, it may be two or
three, and that is was preserved to see, whether in time it should have
the use of its Senses, of the Tongue, and understanding of its two Heads,
to see whether there were two Souls, or onely one, and to say the Truth.
I think that in such an accident both Heads ought to be Baptized, that
in case there should be two Souls, both should partake of the blood of
Christ, for their Eternal Salvation.

I do not find in the same History how long it lived, it being a thing not
much material to History. In the third Verse he marketh, _The day that
_Aquilare_ shall celebrate his Festivals_; and in the fourth he saith
that _Fossan, Thurin, chief Ferrare shall run away_.

To understand this, one must suppose here that the Town of _Cazal_ is
called here the chief of _Ferrare_; because it is the chief City of
_Montserrat_, and as _Paradin_ saith, is called _Cazal_ St. _Bas_, a
handsom and strong place, honoured with many Nobles and antient Families,
as of the Earls of St. _George_ and of _Biandratte_.

Secondly, We must suppose that in the year 1554. the Lord _Figuerol_,
Lieutenant to the Governour of _Milan_ did command in that place. Of
this _Figuerol_ I find in the Author of the four Volumes of the States
and Empires, (when he speaketh of _Spain_) that the House of _Figueroas_
was the root of that of _Aquilar_, which hath several branches, out of
which came the Duke of _Feria_, and the Marquess of _Pliego_, so that
_Figuerol_ and _Aquilar_ is the same thing.

If it be objected that _Figueroas_ and _Figuerol_ are not the same,
_Paradin_ teacheth us, that this _Figuerol_ was bred up amongst the
_Genoeses_, and the corrupted _Italian_ of _Genoa_ may have named the
Captain _Figuerol_ in stead of _Figueroas_.

Thirdly, We must suppose here that _Cazal_ was taken in the night
that is between _Shrove-Tuesday_ and _Ash-Wednesday_, and that from
_Shrove-Sunday_ to that day there were great rejoycings, because of a
famous Marriage that was made between two persons of quality, where the
Lord _Figuerol_ was one of the chief persons invited.

Fourthly, That these rejoycings were the occasion of the taking of
_Cazal_; because the Lord _Salvaison_ Governour of _Verrüe_ hearing of
this Feast, resolved to be among them, though with a different intention.
He had before hand made himself sure of one _Fontarole_, who under
pretence to sell fruit, went up and down the Town to spie what was a
doing.

Fifthly, The resolution of surprizing _Cazal_ was agreed upon, and
the time appointed to be the night between _Shrove-Tuesday_ and
_Ash-Wednesday_, when the Governour, Inhabitants and Souldiers should be
buried in sleep, weary of debaucheries committed the day before.

Sixthly, This resolution was so happily put into execution, that
_Figuerol_ hearing the noise of the _French_ being in Town, came out
of his house, having only his night Gown upon him, and a Halbert in his
hand, to quiet those whom he only thought to be some drunken persons;
but hearing the cry of _France, France_, he presently retired into the
Castle, with all those that were come to the Nuptials.

Seventhly, The Marshal of _Brissac_ coming about seven of the Clock in
the Morning, caused the Tower of _Cazal_ to be assaulted, which was taken
with a considerable loss of the _French_, and after that the Castle which
held out 12 days.

All this being supposed, mark what the Author saith in the third Verse.

The day that _Aquilare_ shall celebrate his Festivals, that is, the day
that _Figuerol of the house of Aquilare shall celebrate his Festivals_,
not only one Festival, but his Festivals, that is of three days.

_Fossen_, _Thurin_, saith the fourth Verse, _Chief Ferrare shall run
away_.

_Fossen_, _Thurin_, doth not signifie two Towns, but one onely; for
although _Fossen_ and _Thurin_ be two Towns, of which _Fossen_ in the
time of the Wars in _Italy_ under _Henry_ II. belonged to the _Spaniard_,
and _Thurin_ to the _French_. These two Towns signifie but one, which is
that of _Fossen_, to which to distinguish it from _Marseilles_, he giveth
the Epithete of _Thurin_, so much as to say, that he speaketh of _Fossen_
a Town of _Piemont_, the chief Town of which is _Thurin_, and not of
_Fossen_, which the Author taketh often for _Marseilles_.

Which the Author maketh plain, when he saith in the singular number, that
_Fossen, Thurin, chief Ferrare shall run away_, to shew that it is onely
one Town of which he speaketh, otherwise if he had intended to speake of
two, he would have put it in the plural number, which is more manifest by
the History, wherein we learn that _Fossen_ belonged to the _Spaniards_,
and _Thurin_ to the _French_, and consequently, being of contrary
parties, they could neither follow, nor fly from a Town which belonged to
one of them.

If any one should object, that the sense of the fourth Verse is, that the
_Chief Ferrare_ shall fly or follow these two Towns, the preceding reason
is repugnant to that sense; because a Town that is of one party, cannot
be friend to two Towns, one of which is of its party, and the other of
the contrary.

The reading of this work shall convince every body, that the Author
setteth down sometimes two Towns for one, to distinguish them from
others, as he nameth _Paul Mansol_, to distinguish that Town of St.
_Paul_, which is three Leagues from the _Rhosne_, over against _Pont_ St.
_Esprit_, from that St. _Paul_ which is in _Provence_.

Now that _Fossen_ in _Piemont_ shall run from _Cazal_ the chief City of
_Montserrat_, because that being taken by the _French_, _Fossen_ could
not expect but perpetual damages from it.

But why? will you say, doth the Author speak rather of _Fossen_, than of
other places that held for the _Spaniards_? I answer, because _Fossen_
was the strongest place that the _Spaniards_ had in _Piemont_ and which
could not be taken by the _French_, though her neighbour _Saviliane_ was,
as we shall shew hereafter.

In the Vulgar impression of this Stanza, there is two faults, one is,
that in the first Verse it puts _Aquileya_, which is a Town that is not
in _Italy_, truth it is, that there is _Aquilee_ a little above _Venice_,
but this hath no correspondency with _Fossen_, _Thurin_, nor the _Chief
of Ferrara_.

In the fourth Verse the impression setteth down _shall follow_, which
maketh nonsense, and therefore I put _shall run away_, which is a word in
_French_ near the other, and maketh a compleat sense, to which agreeth
the birth of that Monster in _February_, and the taking of _Cazal_ in the
Month of _March_. In that year, _John Statius_ setteth _Shrove-Tuesday_
upon the 16 of _February_, and consequently we must say, that the Town
was not taken that year 1554. for the Citadel was taken 12 days after,
which should have been the 19 of _February_, and notwithstanding the
History marks that it was taken upon the 14 of _March_.

Therefore we must conclude, that it was taken the year following 1555.
and to say truth, in that year _Ash-wednesday_ was the 27. of _February_;
in that day the Town was taken, and two days after the Tower of _Cazal_;
after which the Citadel was besieged the second of _March_, and the first
_Saturday_ of Lent, and was taken twelve days after, which was the 14.
of _March_, which convinceth me that _Cazal_ was taken in the year 1555.
upon the 27. of _February_, and therefore that this Stanza is wholly
Prophetical.

    They banished that were carried into the Islands,
    At the change of a more cruel Monarque,

    Because they had not been sparing of their tongues.

ANNOT.

This is very plain, and signifieth no more, but that some persons that
were banished into Islands, and could not hold their tongues; upon the
coming of a Monarque, more cruel than his Predecessor, shall be murdered,
and burnt.

    An Emperour shall be born near _Italy_,
    Who shall cost dear to the Empire,
    They shall say, what people he keepeth company!
    He shall be found less a Prince, than a Butcher.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is for the future; for since _Nostradamus_’s time till now,
such an Emperour was not heard of, that was born near _Italy_, that cost
the Empire so dear, and proved more a Butcher, than a Prince.


LXI.

    French.

    English.

    The miserable and unhappy Common-wealth,
    Shall be wafted by the new Magistrate;
    Their great gathering from exiled persons,
    Shall cause _Swedeland_ to break her Contract.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses foretell what hath happened to _England_ under the
Government of a Common-wealth, and how their new Magistrate _Cromwel_
made a havock of them. The third and fourth Verses, mention what great
sums they exacted from those of the Kings party, and how for that cause
_Swedeland_ foresook their friendship.


LXII.

    Alas what a great loss shall learning suffer,
    Before the Circle of the Moon be accomplished,
    Fire, great flood, and more by ignorant Scepters,
    Then can be made good again in a long age.

ANNOT.

Here the Author bemoaneth the loss of one eminent person in Learning,
be like of _Julius Scaliger_, who lived in his time, and was once his
intimate friend, the two last Verses that great miseries, as Fire and
Flood shall happen by the ignorance of Princes.

    English.

    The Scourges being past, the World shall be diminished,
    Peace for a great while, Lands inhabited,
    Every one safe shall go by Heaven, Land and Sea,
    And then the Wars shall begin a fresh.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth a great tranquillity every where, and after that, Wars

    They shall think to have seen the Sun in the night,
    When the Hog half a man shall be seen,
    Noise, Singing, Battles in Heaven shall be seen to fight,
    And brute beasts shall be heard to speak.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is full of prodigies that are to happen, and for that in the
last Verse, it is no great wonder, for many brute beasts have spoken,
speak now a days, and shall speak hereafter.


LXV.

    French.

    Enfant sans mains, jamais veu si grand Foudre,
    L’Enfant Royal au jeu d’esteuf blessé,

    English.

    A child without hands, so great Lightning never seen,
    The Royal Child wounded at Tennis,
    Bruised at the Well, Lightnings, going to grind,
    Three shall be strucken by the middle.

ANNOT.

The meaning of all this is, that when a child shall be born without
hands, there shall be fearful Lightning; a Royal child shall be hurt at
_Tennes_, and by that Lightning some shall be bruised by a Well, and in a
Mill, and three in the Field shall be killed.


LXVI.

    He that then shall carry the news,
    A little while after shall draw his breath,
    _Viviers_, _Tournon_, _Montferrant_, and _Pradelles_,
    Hail and storm shall make them sigh.

ANNOT.

This Stanza hath a connexion with the foregoing, for the two first Verses
signifie, that he who shall carry the news of that fearful Lightning, and
of the mischief done by it, shall have much ado to recover his breath.

In the last two Verses, the Towns are named which shall suffer most by
that storm, and chiefly by the Hail and the Wind.


LXVII.

    La grand famine que je vois approcher,

    What a great famine do I see drawing near,
    To turn one way, then another, and then become universal,
    So great and long, that they shall come to pluck
    The root from the Wood, and the child from the breast.

ANNOT.

The words and sense of this are plain, and foretell a great famine, which
being first in one Countrey and then in another, shall at last become
general, and last so long, that people shall pluck the Roots from the
Trees, and the children from the breast to feed upon.


LXVIII.

    Shall be put three Innocents!
    Poison shall be suspected, evil Keepers shall betray them,
    They shall be put to horrour by drunken Executioners.

ANNOT.

This is very plain concerning three innocent persons, who shall be
delivered up by their unfaithful keepers, and shall be put to great
torments by drunken Executioners, which torments shall be suspected to
come by poison.

    After Peace, War, Famine, and Innundation,
    Shall tumble a great way, sinking great Countries,
    Yea ancient Buildings, and great Foundation.

ANNOT.

A Stade cometh from the Greek word σταδιον, ἀπὸ τῆς στασεος, because
_Hercules_ did overrun so much ground at one breath; but what space of
ground the Author meaneth by seven Stades, is unknown to me. The rest of
the Prophecy may very well be appropriated to the last fearful eruption
of Mount _Ætna_, which sunk so many Towns and Buildings, and the relation
of which is so handsomly and truly made by the most honourable the Earl
of _Winchelsey_, who was an eye witness to it, in his return from his
Embassy at _Constantinople_.


LXX.

    French.

    Pluye, Faim, Guerre en _Perse_ non cessée,
    La foy trop grande trahira le Monarque;
    Par la finie en _Gaule_ commencée,
    Secret augure pour a un estre parque.

    English.

    The Rain, Famine, War, in _Persia_ being not ceased,
    Too great credulity shall betray the Monarque;
    Being ended there it shall begin in _France_,
    A secret Omen to one that he shall die.

ANNOT.

The meaning of the two first Verses, is, that while the Rain, Famine, and
War shall be in _Persia_, a Monarque shall be betrayed by his credulity.
The third Verse signifieth that this Rain, Famine and War being ended in
_Persia_, it shall begin in _France_. And the fourth Verse, that this
shall be an Omen to a great Person of his approaching death.


LXXI.

    French.

    La Tour Marine troisfois prise & reprise,
    Par _Espagnols_, _Barbares_, _Ligurins_,
    _Marseille_ & _Aix_, _Arles_ par ceux de _Pise_,
    Vast, feu, fer, pille, _Avignon_ des _Thurins_.

    English.

    The Sea-tower three times taken and retaken,
    By _Spaniards_, _Barbarians_, and _Ligurians_,
    _Marseilles_ and _Aix_, _Arles_ by those of _Pisa_,
    Wast, fire, Iron, plunder, _Avignon_ of _Thurins_.

ANNOT.

It is hard to guess what this Sea Tower is, which was taken and retaken
three times; first by the _Spaniards_, next by the _Barbarians_, and
then by the _Ligurians_, that is, either the _Genoeses_, or those of
_Ligorne_, unless he meaneth the _Pignon de Velez_ in _Africa_, first
taken by _Charles_ the V. upon the _Barbarians_, then retaken again by
them, taken again by the _Spaniards_, by the help of the _Genoeses_. In
the third Verse _Marseille_, _Aix_, and _Arles_, are threatned by those
of _Pisa_, that is the _Florentines_, of being ruinated by Fire and
Sword, and to be plundered, as also _Avignon_ by those of _Piemont_.


LXXII.

    French.

    Du tout _Marseille_ des habitans changee,
    Course & poursuite jusques pres de _Lion_,
    _Narbon_, _Tholoze_ par _Bourdeaux_ outragée,
    Tuez, Captifs presque d’un Milion.

    English.

    _Marseille_ shall wholly change her Inhabitants
    These shall run and be pursued as far as _Lion_,
    _Narbon_, _Tholoze_ shall wrong _Bourdeaux_,
    There shall be killed and taken prisoner almost a Milion.

ANNOT.

_Marseilles_ is a Sea-Town in _Provence_, _Narbon_, and _Tholoze_ are
Cities of _Languedoc_, and _Bourdeaux_ is the chief Town in _Gascony_,
the rest is easie to be understood.


LXXIII.

    French.

    _France_ a cinq parts par neglect assaillie,
    _Tunis_, _Argier_, esmeus par _Persiens_,
    _Leon_, _Seville_, _Barcelonne_ faillie,
    N’aura la chasse par les _Venetiens_.

    English.

    _France_ by a neglect shall be assaulted on five sides,
    _Tunis_, _Argier_ shall be moved by the _Persians_,
    _Leon_, _Sevil_, _Barcelone_ shall be missed,
    And not be pursued by the _Venetians_.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is concerning as many Countreys, as there are Verses:
the first is _France_, which by neglect and carelesness of her in
Inhabitants, _shall be assaulted on five several sides_. The second is
concerning _Tunis_ and _Argier_, Cities of _Barbary_, _which shall be
stirred and moved_ (I suppose) to rebel. The third regardeth _Leon_,
_Sevil_, _Barselona_, Cities in _Spain_, and the fourth the _Venetians_.


LXXIV.

    French.

    Apres sejourné vogueront en Empire,
    Le grand secours viendra vers _Antioche_,
    Le noir poil crespe tendra fort a l’Empire,
    Barbe d’Airain se rostira en broche.

    English.

    After a stay, they shall Sail towards an Empire,
    The great succours shall come towards _Antioch_,
    The Black Hair Curled, shall aim much to the Empire,
    The Brazen Beard shall be roasted on a Spit.

ANNOT.

There is no difficulty in this, but in the last Verse, which I had rather
leave to the judgment of the judicious Reader, than to offer any thing
that might make me ridiculous.


LXXV.

    French.

    Le Tyran _Sienne_ occupera _Savone_,
    Le fort gaigné tiendra classe Marine,
    Les deux Armées par la marque d’_Ancone_,
    Par effrayeur le chef sen examine.

    English.

    The Tyrant _Sienna_ shall occupy _Savona_;
    The Fort being won, shall hold a Fleet,
    The two Armies shall go in the mark of _Ancona_,
    By fear the chief shall be examined.

ANNOT.

For the explication of this Stanza, you must understand that _Sienna_ is
a City in _Italy_, now under the Dominion of the Duke of _Tuscany_, who
shall occupy _Savona_, a City now under the Dominion of the Common-wealth
of _Genoa_; the rest is plain enough.


LXXVI.

    French.

    D’un nom farouche tel proferé sera.
    Que les trois Sœurs auront _Fato_ le nom,
    Puis grand peuple par langue & fait dira,
    Plus que nul autre aura bruit & renom.

    English.

    By a wild name one shall be called
    So that the three Sisters shall have the name of _Fato_,
    Afterwards a great people by Tongue and Deeds, shall say,
    He shall have fame and renown more than any other.

ANNOT.

By the three Sisters, he meaneth the three Destinies, _viz._ _Clotho_,
_Lachesis_ and _Atropos_, which the Poets have fained to Spin every mans
destiny, which he calleth here _Fato_, from the Latin word _Fatum_. The
rest may be interpreted as well by the Reader, as by my self.


LXXVII.

    French.

    Entre deux Mers dressera promontoire,
    Qui puis mourra par le mors du Cheval,
    Le fier _Neptune_ pliera Voile noire,
    Par _Calpre_, & Classe aupres de _Rocheval_.

    English.

    Between two Seas shall a Promontory be raised,
    By him, who shall die by the biting of a Horse,
    The proud _Neptune_ shall fold the black Sail.
    Through _Calpre_, and a fleet shall be near _Rocheval_.

ANNOT.

I could not find what he meaneth by _Calpre_, nor by _Rocheval_, which
I suppose to be the proper names of places, when he saith, that proud
_Neptune_ shall fold the black Sail; he maketh an allusion to the History
of _Theseus_, Son of _Ægeus_ King of _Athens_, who being sent with other
Children into _Candia_, to become a prey to the _Minotaure_, his Father
sent the Ship with black _Sails_, as in a case of Mourning, charging
_Theseus_, that if he came back again safe he should put on white Sails,
but coming in sight of _Athens_, _Theseus_ for joy forgot to put on the
white Sails, so that his Father _Ægeus_ thinking he had miscarried, cast
himself from a Rock into the Sea, so that he saying that _Neptune_ shall
fold the black Sail, he meaneth, that there shall be joyful news.


LXXVIII.

    French.

    D’un chef vieillard naistre sens habeté,
    Degenerant par scavoir & par Armes,
    Le chef de _France_ par sa Sœur redouté,
    Champs divisez concedez aux Gensdarmes.

    English.

    An old head shall beget an Idiot,
    Who shall degenerate in Learning and in Arms,
    The head of _France_ shall be feared by his sister,
    The fields shall be divided and granted to the Troopers.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is so plain, that any body may make his interpretation
of it.


LXXIX.

    French.

    _Bazas_, L’_Estoure_, _Condom_, _Auch_, _Agine_,
    Esmeus par Loix, querelle & Monopole,
    Car _Bourd_, _Tholose_, _Bay_, mettra en ruine,
    Renouveler voulant leur _Tauropole_.

    English.

    _Bazas_, L’_Estoure_, _Condom_, _Auch_, _Agen_,
    Being moved by Laws, quarrels and Monopoly,
    For they shall put to ruine _Bordeaux_, _Tholose_, _Bayonne_,
    Going about to renew their _Tauropole_.

ANNOT.

This Key of the sense of this Stanza lieth in the last word _Tauropole_,
which is compounded of the Latin word _Taurus_ a Bull, and of the Greek
word πολέω, that is, to sell; so that the meaning of it is, that those
Cities mentioned shall rise in Rebellion against the _Monopolites_, and
those that shall lay a Tax upon Cattle.


LXXX.

    French.

    De la sixiesme claire splendeur Celeste,
    Viendra Tonnerre si fort en la _Bourgongne_,
    Puis naistra monstre de treshideuse beste,
    _Mars_, _Avril_, _May_, _Juin_, grand charpin & rogne.

    English.

    From the sixth bright Cœlestial splendour,
    Shall come very great Lightning in _Burgundy_,
    After that shall be born a Monster of a most hideous beast,
    In _March_, _April_, _May_, _June_ shall be great quarelling and
      muttering.

ANNOT.

The first Verse is of a most dark and abstruse sense, in which I confess
my ignorance, unless he meant from the sixth of the seven Planets, the
rest is plain enough.


LXXXI.

    French.

    D’humain troupeau neuf seront mis a part,
    De Jugement & Conseil separez,
    Leur sort sera divisé en depart,
    _Kappa_, _Theta_, _Lambda_, mors, bannis egarez.

    English.

    Nine shall be set aside from the human flock,
    Being divided in Judgement and Counsel
    Their fortune shall be to be divided,
    _Kappa_, _Theta_, _Lambda_, dead, banished, scattered.

ANNOT.

There is nothing difficult here, but what he meaneth by _Kappa_, _Theta_,
_Lambda_, which are three Letters of the Greek _Alphabet_.


LXXXII.

    French.

    Quand les Colomnes de Bois grande tremblée,
    D’_Auster_ conduite, couverte de rubriche,
    Tant videra dehors grande assemblée,
    Tremble _Vienne_, & le Païs d’_Austriche_.

    English.

    When the wooden Columns shall be much shaken,
    By _Auster_, and covered with rubbish,
    Then shall go out a great assembly,
    And _Vienne_, and the Land of _Austria_ shall tremble.

ANNOT.

_Auster_, in Latin is the Southwind. _Vienna_ is the chief City of
_Austria_, belonging to the Emperour of _Germany_.


LXXXIII.

    French.

    L’Agent estrange divisera butins,
    _Saturne_ & _Mars_ son regard furieux,
    Horrible, estrange, aux _Thoscans_ & _Latins_,
    _Grees_ qui seront a frapper curiux.

    English.

    The stranger Agent shall divide booties,
    _Saturn_ in _Mars_ shall have his aspect furious,
    Horrid, and strange to the _Tuscans_ and _Latines_,
    The _Grecians_ shall be curious to strike.

ANNOT.

By the _Tuscans_ are meant the people under the Dominion of the Duke of
_Florence_; and by the _Latines_, those under the _Pope_.


LXXXIV.

    French.

    Lune obscurie aux profondes tenebres,
    Son frere passe de couleur ferrugine,
    Le grand caché long temps soubs les tenebres,
    Tiedera Fer dans la Pluie sanguine.

    English.

    The Moon shall be darkned in the deepest darkness,
    Her brother shall pass being of a ferrugineous colour,
    The great one long hidden under darkness,
    Shall make his Iron lukewarm in the bloody Rain.

ANNOT.

This signifieth, that when the Moon shall be totally Eclipsed in the
night, and that all the next day her Brother the Sun shall be seen of a
ferrugineous, (that is an Iron like colour) then shall a great one that
was hidden arise, and do great feats of Arms with the death of many men.


LXXXV.

    French.

    Par la responce de Dame Roy troublé,
    Ambassadeurs mespriseront leur vie,
    Le grand ses Freres contrefera doublé,
    Par deux mourront, hain, ire, & envie.

    English.

    A King shall be troubled by the answer of a Lady,
    Embassadors shall despise their lives,
    The great one being double in mind shall counterfeit his Brothers,
    They shall die by two, anger, hatred, and envy.

ANNOT.

There is nothing difficult here, but the last Verse, which yet will be
plain enough, if you make these three words anger, hatred, and envy not
co-herent with the foremost, but subsisting by themselves; as if one
should say, there shall be anger, hatred, and envy.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    La grande Roine quand se verra vaincue,
    Fera exces de Masculin courage,
    Sur le Cheval, Fleuve passera nue,
    Suite par Fer, a Foy fera outrage.

    English.

    When the great Queen shall see her self vanquished,
    She shall do a deed of a Masculine courage,
    Upon a Horse, she shall pass over the River naked,
    Followed by Iron, she shall do wrong to her Faith.

ANNOT.

It is some great Queen, who seeing her self vanquished, shall swim naked
on Horseback over a River, being followed by those that would have either
killed or taken her, and after that shall forfeit her faith, but whether
it be to her Husband, Friends, or Relations, is not expressed.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    _Ennosigee_ feu du Centre de Terre
    Fera trembler autour de Cité Neuve,
    Deux grands Rochers long temps feront la guerre,
    Puis _Arethuse_ rougira nouveau fleuve.

    English.

    _Ennosigee_, fire of the Center of the Earth,
    Shall make quake about the New City,
    Two great Rocks shall a great while War one against the other,
    After that, _Arethusa_ shall colour red a new River.

ANNOT.

_Ennosigee_ is a Greek word εννοσίγαιος, in Latin _Terræ quassator_, from
ἔνίω _moveo_, and γαῖα _Terra_, and is an Epithete of _Neptune_. The
meaning then of this Stanza is, that the Sea shall make the Earth quake,
and fire come out of the Earth about _Naples_, which in Greek is called
_Neapolis_, that is, a _New City_.

_Arethusa_ is a Fountain in _Sicily_, which a little way from its Spring,
groweth into a River. The rest is left to the interpretation of the
Reader.


LXXXVIII.

    French.

    Le Divin mal surprendra un grand Prince,
    Un peu devant aura femme espousée,
    Son appuy & credit a un coup viendra mince,
    Conseil mourra pour la teste rasée.

    English.

    The Divine sickness shall surprise a great Prince,
    A little while after he hath married a woman,
    His support and credit shall at once become slender,
    Council shall die for the shaven head.

ANNOT.

By the Divine sickness, he meaneth the _falling sickness_, called by the
Greeks _Epilepsia_, and by the Latines _Morbus Sacer_. By the shaven
head, he meaneth some Ecclesiastical person of the _Romish_ Religion; the
construction of the whole is easie.


LXXXIX.

    French.

    Tous ceux d’_Illerde_ seront dans la _Moselle_,
    Mettant a mort tous ceux de _Loire_ & _Seine_,
    Le course Marin viendra pres d’_Hautevelle_,
    Quand _Espagnols_ ouvrira toute veine.

    English.

    All those of _Illerde_ shall be in the _Mosel_,
    Putting to death all those of _Loire_ and _Seine_,
    The Sea course shall come near _Hautevelle_,
    When the _Spaniard_ shall open all veins.

ANNOT.

By _Illerde_ he meaneth the City of l’_Isle_ in _Flanders_, the _Mosel_
is a River that runneth through _Lorrain_, the _Loire_ and _Seine_ are
two other Rivers of _France_, the first of which passeth at _Orleans_,
and the second at _Paris_; the two last Verses are too hard for me to
interpret.


XC.

    French.

    _Bourdeaux_, _Poitiers_, au son de la Campane,
    A grande classe ira jusqu’a _Langon_,
    Contre _Gaulois_ sera leur _Tramontane_,
    Quand Monstre hideux naistra pres de _Orgon_.

    English.

    _Bourdeaux_, _Poitiers_, at the sound of the Bell,
    With a great Navy shall go as far as _Langon_,
    Against the _French_ shall their _Tramontane_ be,
    When an hideous Monster shall be born near _Orgon_.

ANNOT.

_Tramontana_, in _Italian_, is the North-wind. _Orgon_, is the name of a
Town in _Gascony_, the rest of the construction is not difficult.


XCI.

    French.

    Les dieux feront aux humains apparence,
    Ce quils seront auteurs de grand conflict,

    Que vers main gauche sera plus grande affliction.

    English.

    The Gods shall make it appear to Man-kind,
    That they are the Authors of a great War;
    For the Heaven that was Serene, shall shew Sword and Lance,
    Signifying, that on the left hand the affliction shall be greater.

ANNOT.

He foretelleth here some Prodigies that shall be in the Air, as _Swords_
and _Lances_ after fair weather, which shall be forerunners of great
Wars, and chiefly in those Countries that shall be situated on the left
hand of these Prodigies.


XCII.

    French.

    Soubs un la paix, par tout sera clemence,
    Mais non long temps, pille & rebellion,
    Par refus Ville, Terre & Mer entamée,
    Morts & Captifs le liers d’un Million.

    English.

    Under one shall be peace, and every where clemency,
    But not a long while, then shall be plundering and Rebellion,
    By a denyal shall Town, Land and Sea be assaulted,
    There shall be Dead and taken Prisoners the third part of a Million.

ANNOT.

The words and sense are plain.


XCIII.

    French.

    Terre _Italique_ des Mons tremblera,
    _Lion_ & _Coq_ non trop confederez,
    en lieu & peur l’un l’autre saidera,
    Seul _Catulon_ & _Celtes_ moderez.

    English.

    The _Italian_ Land of the Mountains shall tremble,
    The _Lion_ and the _Cock_ shall not agree very well together,
    Shall for fear help one another,
    The only _Catulon_ and _Celtes_ shall be moderate.

ANNOT.

By the _Lion_ he understandeth the _English_, because of their Arms, and
by the _Cock_ the _French_, called in Latin _Gallus_, which signifieth a
Cock; _Catulon_ is the _Spaniards_, as if he should say _Castilian_; the
_Celtes_ are the _Dutch_ of the Low-Countries.


XCIV.

    French.

    Au _Port Selyn_ le Tyrant mis a Mort,
    La liberté non pourtant recouvrée,
    Le nouveau _Mars_ par vindict & remort,
    Dame par force de frayeur honorée.

    English.

    In the _Port Selyn_ the Tyrant shall be put to death
    And yet the liberty shall not be recovered,
    The new _Mars_ by vengeance and remorse,
    Lady by excess of fear honoured.

ANNOT.

By the _Port Selyn_, is meant _Constantinople_, because of several
Emperours of the _Turks_ that have been of that name, therefore the
intention of this Prophecy, is, that one of the Turkish Emperours shall
be put to death at _Constantinople_, which for all that, shall not
recover her liberty. The _new Mars_, be like he is so called, that shall
put him to death _by vengeance without remorse_. _The Lady by excess of
fear honoured_, may be applied to the present great Sultaness, Mother to
this present Emperour of the _Turks_, who hath hitherto made her self
very considerable by a great party, which she hath raised against her
Son, to prevent him from putting his Brothers to death, as is usually
practised in that Court.


XCV.

    French.

    Devant Moustier trouvé enfant besson,
    D’Heroik sang de Moine & vetustique,
    Son bruit per Secte, Langue, & puissance Son,
    Qu’on dira fort eslevé le Vopisque.

    English.

    Before the Minster shall one twin be found,
    From Heroik blood, of a Monk and Ancient,
    His fame by Sect, Tongue, and Power shall be sounded,
    So that they shall say the Vopisk is much raised.

ANNOT.

The meaning of the whole is, that a Twin shall be found before a Church,
begot by a Monk, of Illustrious and Ancient Family, and shall become very
famous, _So that they shall say the Vopisk is much raised_. _Vopiscus_ in
Latin, is, that one of the Twins, which cometh to perfect Birth.


XCVI.

    French.

    Celuy qu’aura la charge de destruire,

    English.

    He that shall have charge to destroy,
    Churches and Sects, changed by fancy;
    Shall do more harm to the Rocks, than to the living,
    By a smooth tongue filling up the Ears.

ANNOT.

As the words of this Stanza are plain, so is the sense most obscure, and
so to be left to the Readers private Judgement.


XCVII.

    French.

    Ce que fer, flamme, na sceu parachever,
    La douce langue au conseil viendra faire,
    Par respos, songe le Roy fera resuer,
    Plus l’Ennemy en feu sang militaire.

    English.

    What neither Iron nor Fire could compass,
    Shall be done by a smooth tongue in the Councel,
    In sleep a dream shall make the King to think,
    The more the Enemy in fire and Military blood.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is plain, though the words be somthing untowardly
expressed.


XCVIII.

    English.

    The Captain that shall lead an infinite deal of people
    Far from their Countrey, to one of strange manners and Language,
    Five thousand in _Candia_ and _Thessalia_ finished,
    The Head running away, shall be safe in a Barn by the Sea.

ANNOT.

It is some great Commander that shall lead a multitude of people into a
strange Countrey, far from their own; suppose _Candia_ and _Thessalia_,
where the said Commander shall be compelled to run away, and to save
himself in a Barn by the Sea side.


XCIX.

    Le grand Monarque qui fera compagnie,
    Avec deux Rois unis par amitié,
    O quel souspir fera la grand mesgnie,
    Enfans, _Narbonne_ alentour, quel pitié!

    English.

    The great Monarch shall keep company,
    With two Kings united in friendship;
    O what fights shall be made by their followers!
    Children, O what pity shall be about _Narbon_.

ANNOT.

This Stanza requireth no interpretation more, than what every one will be
pleased to give himself.

    English.

    A great while shall be seen in the Air a gray Bird,
    Near _Dola_ and the _Tuscan_ Land,
    Holding in his Bill a green bough;
    Then shall a great one die, and the War have and end.

ANNOT.

_Dola_ is a Town in _Burgundy_. The _Tuscan_ Land, is that which
belongeth to the Duke of _Florence_.




THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ II.


I.

    French.

    Vers _Aquitaine_ par insults _Britanniques_,
    De par eux mesmes grandes incursions,
    Pluyes, Gelees, feront terroirs iniques,
    _Port Selyn_ fortes fera invasions.

    English.

    Towards _Gascony_ by _English_ assaults,
    By the same shall be made great incursions,
    Rains, Frosts, shall marre the ground.
    _Port Selyn_ shall make strong Invasions.

ANNOT.

Three Prophecies are contained in this Stanza, the first that the
_English_ shall make an incursion in _Gascony_; the second, that there
shall be a great dearth by Rains and Frosts; the third, that the _Turks_
shall make great Incursion.


II.

    French.

    La teste glue sera la teste blanche,
    Autant de mal que _France_ a fait leur bien,
    Mort a l’_Anthene_, grand pendu fus la branche,
    Quand prins des siens, le Roy dira combien.

    English.

    The Glue-head shall do the white head
    As much harm, as _France_ hath done it good,
    Dead at the Sails yard, a great one hang’d on a Tree,
    When a King taken by his own, shall say, how much?

ANNOT.

I did never find that word of Glue-head before in any Author, and I
believe if _Cotgrave_ were alive again, it would puzzle him to give the
interpretation thereof.

The third and fourth signifie, that one shall be hanged on the
Sails-yard, and another on a Tree, when a King shall be taken by his own
Men, and shall say how much? that is, how much money shall I give you to
set me free.


III.

    French.

    Par la chaleur Solaire sur la Mer,
    De _Negrepont_, les Poissons demy cuits,
    Les Habitans les viendront entamer,
    Quand _Rhode_ & _Genes_ leur faudra le Biscuit.

    English.

    By the heat of the Sun upon the Sea
    Of _Negrepont_, the Fishes shall be half broiled,
    The Inhabitants shall come to cut them up,
    When _Rhodes_ and _Genoa_ shall want Biscake.

ANNOT.

_Negrepont_ is an Island of the _Archipelago_ near _Morea_, anciently
called _Eubœa_. _Rhodes_ is another Island, and, _Genoa_ a City in
_Italy_, by the Seaside. The rest is plain.

    Depuis _Monac_ jusqu’aupres de _Sicile_,
    Toute la plage demoura desolée,
    Il ny aura Fauxbourgs, Cité, ne Ville,
    Que par _Barbares_ pillée soit & volée.

    English.

    From _Monaco_ as far as _Sicily_,
    All the Sea coast shall be left desolate,
    There shall not be Suburbs, Cities, nor Towns,
    Which shall not be pillaged and plundred by _Barbarians_.

ANNOT.

_Monaco_ is a Town seated by the Sea-side in _Italy_, between _Provence_
and _Genoa_. This Prophecy hath been once already fulfilled, when the
famous Pyrate _Barbarossa_, being sent by the grand Seignor, to help the
_French_ King against the Emperour _Charles_ the V. in his return home,
plundered all that Coast, and carried away an innumerable multitude of
people into slavery.


V.

    French.

    Quand dans Poisson, Fer & Lettre enfermée,
    Hors sortira qui puis fera la Guerre,
    Aura par Mer sa classe bien ramée;
    Aparoissant pres de _Latine_ Terre.

    English.

    When in a Fish, Iron and a Letter shall be shut up,
    He shall go out that afterwards shall make War,
    He shall have his Fleet by Sea well provided,
    Appearing by the _Roman_ Land.

ANNOT.

The words and the sense are plain.


VI.

    French.

    Aupres des Portes & dedans deux Citez,
    Seront deux Fleaux & onc n’aperceu un tel,
    Faim, dedans Peste, de Fer hors gens boutez,
    Crier secours au grand Dieu immortel.

    English.

    Near the Gates and within two Cities
    Shall be two Scourges, I never saw the like,
    Famine, within Plague, people thrust out by the Sword,
    Shall cry for help to the great God immortal.

ANNOT.

This needeth no Interpretation.


VII.

    French.

    Entre plusieurs aux Isles deportez,
    L’un estre nay a deux dens en la gorge,
    Mourront de Faim, les Arbres esbroutez,
    Pour eux neuf Roy, nouvel Edict leur forge.

    English.

    Among many that shall be transported into the Islands,
    One shall be born with two Teeth in his mouth,
    They shall die of hunger, the Trees shall be eaten,
    They shall have a new King, who shall make new Laws for them.

ANNOT.

This is so plain, that it needeth no explication.


VIII.

    French.

    Temples Sacrez, prime facon _Romaine_,
    Rejetteront les goffes Fondemens,
    Prenant leurs Loix premieres & humaines,
    Chassants non tout, de Saints le cultement.

    English.

    Churches Consecrated, and the ancient _Roman_ way,
    Shall reject the tottering Foundations,
    Sticking to their first humane Laws,
    Expelling, but not altogether the worshipping of Saints.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy, is concerning the beginning of the Reformed Religion, when
the _Roman_ Church rejected it, yet nevertheless, for shame they left
off many of their fopperies, for ever since they never appeared so great
Worshippers of Saints as before.


IX.

    French.

    Neuf ans le Regne le maigre en paix tiendra,
    Puis il cherra en soif si sanguinaire,
    Pour luy grand peuple sans Foy & Loy mourra,
    Tué par un beaucoup plus debonaire.

    English.

    Nine years shall the lean one keep the Kingdom in Peace,
    Then he will fall into such a bloody thirst,
    That a great people shall die without Faith or Law,
    He shall be killed by one milder than himself.

ANNOT.

It is a lean man that shall keep in Peace the Kingdom, for the space of
nine years, and then shall become cruel; so that he shall put to death
many people without Law, or regard of his promise.


X.

    French.

    Avant long temps le tout sera rangé,
    Nous esperons un siecle bien senestre,
    L’Estat des masques & des seuls bien changé,
    Peu trouveront qui a son rang vueille estre.

    English.

    Before it be long, all shall be set in order,
    We look for a sinister Age,
    The state of the Visards and of _the alone_ shall be changed,
    They shall find few that will keep their ranks.

ANNOT.

All the difficulty of this consisteth in what he meaneth by the _Visard_
and _alone_, for my part, I believe he aimeth at the _Popish_ Clergy and
Monks; the first by reason of their Hypocrisy, the other by reason of
their solitariness. The rest is plain.


XI.

    French.

    Le prochain, fils de l’_Aisnier_ parviendra,
    Tant eslevé jusqu’au au Regne des fors,
    Son aspre gloire un chascun la craindra,
    Mais les enfans du Regne jettez hors.

    English.

    The eldest Son of l’_Aisnier_ shall prosper,
    Being raised to the degree of the great ones,
    Every one shall fear his high glory,
    But his children shall be cast out.

ANNOT.

This is an Horoscope, for the Interpretation of which we are beholding
to, Mr. _Mannessier_ of _Amiens_, who saith that the Father of the Lords
l’_Aisniers_ writ to _Nostradamus_ his friend, to know his childrens
fortune, who sent him those four Verses for an answer, by which it is
evident that the eldest should be an eminent Man, as it fell out, being
one of the chiefest men in the Province of _Anjou_, and one of the
chiefest instruments to make Peace between _Louis_ the XIII. and his
Mother _Mary_ of _Medicis_, after the Battle of _Pont de Cé_.

The fourth Verse saith, that some of his other Children should be
expelled the Kingdom, as it happened by reason of a false report raised
against one of them, which compelled him to retire into _Portugal_ till
the truth was known, as it was afterwards to his great repute and honour.


XII.

    French.

    Yeux clos ouverts d’antique fantaisie,
    L’habit des seuls sera mis a neant,
    Le grand Monarque chastiera leur frenesie,
    Ravir des Temples le Thresor par devant.

    English.

    Eyes shut, shall be open by an antick fancy,
    The cloths of the alone shall be brought to nothing.
    The great Monarck shall punish their frenzy,
    For having ravished the Treasure of the Temple before.

ANNOT.

I can fasten this upon no body, but upon some Monks, which are called
here _The alone_, because of their solitary life, who shall be punished
by a King, for having robbed the Church.


XIII.

    French.

    Le corps sans ame plus n’estre en sacrifice,
    Jour de la mort mis en Nativité.
    L’Esprit Divin sera l’ame fœlice,
    Voiant le Verbe en son Eternité.

    English.

    The body without the soul shall be no more admitted in Sacrifice,
    The day of the death shall be put for the Birth-day,
    The Divine Spirit shall make the Soul happy,
    By seeing the Word in its Eternity.

ANNOT.

The first Verse seemed to Prophecy the Reformation of Religion, and the
change of opinion concerning the Lords Supper, which should be no more
a Sacrifice (as the _Roman_ Church calleth the Mass) of a body without
a soul, but only a commemoration of the Lords death, as the second
Verse confirmeth, saying, _The day of the death shall be put for the
Birth-day_, seeing, that by the commemoration of that death, we are
renewed into a newness of life, and as it were born again. The last two
Verse are easie.


XIV.

    French.

    A _Tours_, _Gien_, _Gergeau_, seront yeux penetrans,
    Descouvriront le long de la grande _Sereine_,
    Elle & sa Suite au Port seront entrans,
    Combat poussez Puissance Souveraine.

    English.

    At _Tours_, _Gien_, _Gergeau_, shall be piercing eyes,
    Who shall discover along the great _Syren_,
    She and her Attendans shall enter into the Port,
    By a fight shall be thrust out the Soveraign Power.

ANNOT.

_Tours_, _Gien_, and _Gergeau_ are Cities upon the River of _Loire_,
which is called here _the great Syren_, because of the length of its
course, the meaning then is, that those Cities shall be watchful, and
stand upon their guard, and shall fight against a King, which if it hath
already come to pass in the Civil Wars, or shall happen hereafter, I
cannot affirm.


XV.

    French.

    Un peu devant Monarque trucidé,
    _Castor_, _Pollux_, en nef astre crinite,
    L’Airain public, par Terre & Mer vuidé,
    _Pisa_, _Ast_, _Ferrare_, _Turin_ Terre interdite.

    English.

    A little before a Monarch be killed
    _Castor_, and _Pollux_ shall appear, and a Comet in the Ship;
    The publick brass, by Land and Sea shall be emptyed,
    _Pisa_, _Ast_, _Ferrare_, _Turin_, Countreys forbidden.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that a little before a Monarck be killed,
_Castor_ and _Pollux_ two Meteores so called, as also a Comet in that
constellation of the Heavens, called _the ship of Argos_, and _the
Publick Brass_, that is, the Canons by Land and Sea shall be emptied, and
these Towns of _Italy_, viz. _Pisa_, _Ast_, _Ferrare_, _Turin_, shall be
excommunicated by the _Pope_.


XVI.

    French.

    _Naples_, _Palerme_, _Sicile_, _Syracuse_,
    Nouveaux Tyrants, fulgures, feu Cœlestes,
    Force de _Londres_, _Gand_, _Bruxelles_, & _Suse_,
    Grand Hecatombe, Triomphe, faire Festes.

    English.

    _Naples_, _Palermo_, _Sicily_, _Syracusa_,
    New Tyrants, Lightnings, Celestial fires,
    Army from _London_, _Ghent_, _Bruxelles_, and _Suse_,
    A great Hecatomb, Triumphs, and Feasts.

ANNOT.

There is nothing difficult but the word _Hecatomb_, which is a Greek
word, signifying a Sacrifice of an hundred Oxen.


XVII.

    French.

    Le Camp du Temple de la Vierge Vestale,
    Non esloigné d’_Ethene_ & Monts _Pyrenées_,
    Le grand conduit est chassé dans la Male,
    North gettez Fleuves, & Vignes mastinées.

    English.

    The Camp of the Temple of the Vestal Virgin,
    Not far from _Ethene_ and the _Pyrenean_ Mountains,
    The great Conduit is driven in the Clock-bag,
    Rivers overflown in the North, and the Vines spoiled.

ANNOT.

There is so many faults in the impression of this, and so hard to be
rectified, that I had rather leave it to the liberty of the judicious
Reader, then make my self ridiculous in not giving him satisfaction.


XVIII.

    French.

    Nouvelle Pluie, subite, impetueuse,
    Empeschera subit deux excercites,
    Pierre, Ciel, Feux, faire la Mer pierreuse,
    La mort de sept, Terre & Marin subites.

    English.

    A new Rain, sudden, impetuous,
    Shall suddenly hinder two Armies,
    Stone, Heaven, Fire, shall make the Sea stony,
    The death of seven shall be sudden upon Land and Sea.

ANNOT.

The first two Verses signifie, that a sudden and impetuous Rain shall
hinder two Armies from fighting.

The two last Verses foretell several Prodigies, the which happening,
seven persons shall suddenly die upon the Sea and Land.


XIX.

    French.

    Nouveaux venus, lieu basty sans defence,
    Occuper place pour lors inhabitable,
    Prez, Maisons, Champs, Villes prendre a plaisance,
    Faim, Peste, Guerre, arpent long labourable.

    English.

    New comers shall build a place without fence,
    And shall occupy a place that was not then habitable,
    They shall at their pleasure take Fields, Houses and Towns.
    There shall be Famine, Plague, War, and a long arable field.

ANNOT.

This is so plain, that it needeth no Interpretation.


XX.

    French.

    Freres & Sœurs en divers lieux captifs,
    Se trouveront passer pres du Monarque,
    Les contempler ses deux yeux ententifs,
    Des plaisant vont, Menton, Front, Nez les marques.

    English.

    Brothers and Sisters shall be made slaves in divers places,
    And shall pass before the Monarck,
    Who shall look upon them with attentive eyes,
    They shall go in heaviness, witness their Chin, Forehead and Nose.

ANNOT.

This is obvious to the meanest capacity.


XXI.

    French.

    L’Ambassadeur envoié par _Biremes_,
    A my chemin incogneus repoulsez,
    De Sel renfort viendront quatre triremes,
    Cordes & Chaines en _Negrepont_ troussez.

    English.

    The Embassadour that was sent in _Biremes_,
    In the midleway shall be repulsed by unknown Men,
    From the Salt to his succours shall come four triremes,
    Ropes and Chains shall be carried to _Negrepont_.

ANNOT.

_Bireme_ is a Galley that hath two ranges of Oares, _Trireme_ is one
that hath three ranges. The meaning then of this is, that an Embassadour
shall be sent in a Galley with two ranges of Oares, and that he shall be
met in his way by unknown men, that is, Pyrates; there shall come to his
succours _from the Salt_, that is, from the _French_ four _Triremes_,
that is four Galleys, every one having three ranges of Oares, but they
shall all be carried to _Negrepont_, an Island belonging to the _Turk_.


XXII.

    French.

    Le Camp _Ascop_ d’_Europe_ partira,
    Sadioignant proche de l’Isle submergée,
    D’_Arton_ classe Phalange partira,
    Nombril du Monde plus grand voix subrogée.

    English.

    The Camp _Ascop_ shall go from _Europe_,
    And shall come near the drowned Island;
    From _Arton_ shall go an Army by Sea and Land,
    By the Navel of the World a greater vice shall be substituted.

ANNOT.

The Author hath darkned this Stanza with so many barbarous words, as
_Camp Ascop_, _drowned Island_, D’_Arton_, _Navel of the World_, that
it is very like either he did not understand himself, or would not be
understood by others.


XXIII.

    French.

    _Palaces_ Oiseaux, par Oiseau dechassé,
    Bien tost apres le Prince parvenu,
    Combien qu’hors Fleuve ennemy repoulsé,
    Dehors saisy, trait d’Oiseau soustenu.

    English.

    _Palais_ Birds, driven away by a Bird,
    Soon after that, the Prince is come to his own,
    Although the enemy be driven beyond the River,
    He shall be seased upon without, by the trick of the Bird.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that many Courtiers (called here _Palace_ Birds)
shall be justled out of favour by another principal Bird, that is a great
Courtier, as soon as the Prince shall come to his own.

The two last Verses seem to foretell that the said principal Courtier
shall seize upon the Prince, notwithstanding that some succour shall come
to his help, which shall be beaten back beyond the River.


XXIV.

    French.

    Bestes farouches de faim Fleuves traner,
    Plus part du Champ encontre _Ister_ sera,
    En Cage de Fer le grand fera traisner.
    Quand rien enfant de _Germain_ n’observera.

    English.

    Wild Beasts for hunger shall swim over Rivers,
    Most part of the field shall be near _Ister_,
    Into an Iron Cage he shall cause the great one to be drawn,
    When the Child of _German_ shall observe nothing.

ANNOT.

_Ister_ is a River, _German_ is a proper name of some considerable
person, whose Son shall not observe or take notice when that eminent
person mentioned here, shall be drawn into an Iron Cage.


XXV.

    French.

    La Garde estrange trahira Forteresse,
    Espoir & umbre de plus haut mariage,
    Garde deceüe Fort prins dedans la presse,
    _Loire_, _Saone_, _Rhosne_, _Gar_, a Mort outrage.

    English.

    The Garrison of strangers shall betray the Fort,
    Under the hope and shadow of a higher Match,
    The Garrison shall be deceived, and the Fort taken in the crowd,
    _Loire_, _Saone_, _Rhosne_, _Gar_, shall do harm to Death.

ANNOT.

There is no difficulty but in the last Verse, where you must observe that
_Loire_, _Saone_, _Rhosne_, and _Gardon_, which for the Verses sake is
contracted into _Gar_; are Rivers of _France_, which are threatned here
of overflowing, and causing the death of many people.


XXVI.

    French.

    Pour la faveur que la Cité fera,
    Au grand qui tost perdra Camp de Bataille,
    Le sang d’ans _Pau_ le _Thesin_ versera,
    De sang feux, mors, noyez de coup de taille.

    English.

    Because of the favour the City shall shew,
    To the great one, who soon after shall loose the Battle,
    The _Thesin_ shall pour blood into the _Pau_,
    Of blood, fire, dead, drowned, by Edgeling.

ANNOT.

This is plain, if you observe that the _Thesin_ is a River of _Italy_,
and the _Pau_ another, into the which the _Thesin_ runneth.


XXVII.

    French.

    Le Divin Verbe sera du ciel frappé,
    Qui ne pourra proceder plus avant,
    Du resserrant le secret estoupé,
    Quon marchera par dessus & devant.

    English.

    The Divine Word shall be struck by Heaven,
    So that he shall proceed no further,
    The secret of the close Keeper, shall be so closed up,
    That people shall tread upon, and before it.

ANNOT.

By the _Divine Word_, you must not understand the second person of the
Trinity, or else all this Stanza would be absurd; but you must understand
a Divine or Theologian, called in Greek θεόλογος, which signifieth a
_Divine Word_. The meaning therefore of it, is, that a _Theologian shall
be struck by Heaven_; that is, shall die, so that he shall proceed no
further in his work, which I suppose by the two last Verses, was the
Philosophers stone; for in the two last Verses he saith, that the _secret
of the close Keeper_, that is, of him that wrought secretly, shall (by
his death) be so closed up, _that people shall tread on, and before it_.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Le penultiesme de Surnom de Prophete,
    Prendra _Diane_ pour son jour & repos,
    Loing vaguera par Frenetique teste,
    Et delivrant un grand peuple d’Impos.

    English.

    The last, but one of the Sirname of the Prophet,
    Shall take _Diana_ for his day and his rest,
    He shall wander far by reason of his Frenetick head,
    Delivering a great people from impositions.

ANNOT.

This is concerning a _false Prophet_, which is called here the last but
one of that Surname, who shall make _Diana_ (that is _Monday_ which is
dedicated to _Diana_) his _Sunday_ or _Sabbath day_, and so wandring to
and fro in a _Frenetick_ manner, shall perswade many people to pay no
Taxes.


XXIX.

    French.

    L’Oriental sortira de son Siege,
    Passer les Monts _Apennins_, voir la _Gaule_,
    Transpassera le Ciel, les Eaux & Neige,
    Et un chacun frappera de sa Gaule.

    English.

    The Oriental shall come out of his Seat,
    Shall pass over the _Apennine_ Mountains, and see _France_,
    Shall go over the Air, the Waters and Snow,
    And shall strike every one with his Rod.

ANNOT.

It is an Eastern Prince, who leaving his Countrey, shall come over the
_Apennine_ Mountains, which divide _Italy_, and come as far as _France_,
destroying all before him.


XXX.

    French.

    Un qui les Dieux d’_Annibal_ infernaux,
    Fera renaistre, effrayeur des Humains,
    Onc plus d’horreur ne plus dire journaux,
    Qu’avint viendra par _Babel_ aux _Romains_.

    English.

    One that shall cause the infernal Gods of _Hannibal_
    To live again, the terror of Mankind,
    There was never more horror, not to say ill dayes,
    Did happen, or shall, to the _Romans_ by _Babel_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was concerning _Charles_ V. Emperour, who sacked _Rome_,
took the Pope Prisoner, and filled it with more horror and slaughter than
_Hannibal_ did, though a Heathen.


XXXI.

    French.

    En _Campanie_ le _Cassilin_ fera tant,
    Quon ne verra que d’Aux les Champs couvers,
    Devant apres la pluye de long temps,
    Hormis les arbres rien lon verra de verts.

    English.

    In _Campania_ the _Cassilin_ shall so behave himself,
    That nothing shall be seen but Fields covered with Garlick,
    Before, and after it, shall not Rain for a good while,
    Except the Trees, no Green shall be seen.

ANNOT.

This hath a dependance upon the foregoing Stanza; for _Campania_ is the
Province wherein _Rome_ is seated, and _Cassilin_, called _Campania
di Roma_, is the same as _Castillan_, because _Charles_ V. was not
only Emperour, but also King of _Spain_, the chief Province of which
is _Castilia_: therefore the Author describeth here the misery and
devastation of _Campania di Roma_ by the _Castilian_, who left nothing in
the ground, but Garlick, which is their most delicate food, and nothing
Green but the Trees.


XXXII.

    French.

    Lait Sang, Grenovilles, escouldre en _Dalmatie_,
    Conflit donné, peste pres de _Balene_,
    Cry sera grand par toute _Esclavonie_,
    Lors naistra Monstre pres & dedans _Ravenne_.

    English.

    Milk, Blood, Frogs shall reign in _Dalmatia_,
    A Battle fought, the Plague near _Balene_,
    A great cry shall be through all _Sclavonia_,
    Then shall be born a Monster, near and within _Ravenna_.

ANNOT.

_Dalmatia_ and _Sclavonia_, are Countreys joyning to the _Adriatick_ Sea,
belonging to the _Venetians_. _Ravenna_ is a City in _Italy_, the rest
needeth no interpretation.


XXXIII.

    French.

    Dans le torrent qui descend de _Verone_,
    Par lors qu’au Pau guidera son entrée,
    Un grand Naufrage, & non moins en _Garonne_,
    Quand ceux de _Genes_ Marcheront leur contrée.

    English.

    In the torrent which cometh down from _Verona_,
    About the place where it falleth into the _Pau_,
    A great Shipwrack, and no less in _Garonna_,
    When those of _Genoa_ shall go into their Countrey.

ANNOT.

_Verona_ is a City in _Italy_, belonging to the _Venetians_, through
the middle of which runneth a River called _Adde_, which falleth into
the River _Pau_, about which place there shall be a great Shipwrak; as
also another in the River of _Garonna_, which passeth at _Bordeaux_, the
time that the Author marketh, is when those of _Genoa_ shall go into
their Countrey, that is to say, when some Ships of _Genoa_ shall come to
_Bordeaux_.


XXXIV.

    French.

    L’Ire insensée du Combat furieux,
    Fera a Table par Freres le Fer luire,
    Les departir, blessé, curieux,
    Le fier duel viendra en _France_ nuire.

    English.

    The mad anger of the furious fight,
    Shall cause by Brothers the Iron to glister at the Table,
    To part them one wounded, curious,
    The fierce Duel shall do harm after in _France_.

ANNOT.

It is the short History of two Brothers, who fought at the Table, whereby
one that was curious to part them was wounded, they afterwards fought a
Duel, in whose imitation many since have been fought, to the great harm
of the _French_ Gentry.


XXXV.

    French.

    Dans deux Logis de nuit le feu prendra,
    Plusieurs dedans estoufez & rostis,
    Pres de deux Fleuves pour seur il adviendra,
    Sol, l’Arc, & Caper, tous seront amortis.

    English.

    The fire shall take by night in two Houses,
    Many shall be stifled and burnt in it;
    Near two Rivers it shall for certain happen,
    Sun, Arc, Caper, they shall all be mortified.

ANNOT.

By _Sun_, _Arc_, _Caper_, he meaneth the Sun being in the Signs of
_Sagitarius_ and _Capricornus_.

This Prophecy was fulfilled about 90. years ago in the City of _Lion_,
seated upon two Rivers, _viz._ the _Rhosne_ and the _Saone_, for about
that time several Merchants coming to the Fair, some went to lodge at the
Silver Head, in the street _de la Grenete_, where being in an upper room,
as they were talking of their businesses, and passing the time merrily,
the fire took in the Kitchen where was abundance of Oil, which did burn
so suddenly and so violently, that the lower part of the House was
presently consumed. Those Merchants that were in the upper room towards
the street, begun to look for their Clock-bags, that were lockt up in a
Trunk; but while they were busie about opening the Trunk, the Stair-case
fell, and the fire got into their Room, then begun they to cry for help
through the Windows. They would willingly have thrown themselves down
the Windows, but they were barred with Iron, so that they could not save
themselves, the House being a fire on all sides; Moreover, the neighbours
taking more care of their own Houses, then of those Strangers, did run
every one to his own concerns, so that they all miserably perished.

XXXVI.

    French.

    Du grand Prophete les Lettres seront prinses,
    Entre les Mains du Tyran deviendront,
    Frauder son Roy seront ses entreprinses,
    Mais ses rapines bien tost le troubleront.

    English.

    The Letters of the great Prophet shall be intercepted,
    They shall fall into the hands of the Tyrant,
    His undertakings shall be to deceive his King,
    But his extortions shall trouble him soon.

ANNOT.

It is some eminent Churchman, whose Letters shall be intercepted, by
which he intended to betray his King, therefore his actions shall be
called in question, and being found guilty of extortion, he shall suffer
for it.


XXXVII.

    French.

    De ce grand nombre que l’on envoiera,
    Pour secourir dans le fort assiegez,
    Peste & Famine tous les devorera,
    Horsmis septante qui seront profligez.

    English.

    Of that great number which shall be sent,
    To succour the besieged in the Fort,
    Plague and Famine shall devour them all,
    Except seventy that shall be beaten.

ANNOT.

This is so plain, that it needeth no explication.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    Des Condamnez sera fait un grand nombre,
    Quand les Monarques seront conciliez,
    Mais l’un deux viendra si mal encombre,
    Que guere ensemble ne seront raliez.

    English.

    There shall be a great number of condemned men,
    When the Monarchs shall be reconciled,
    But one of them shall come to such misfortune,
    That their reconciliation shall not last long.

ANNOT.

The words and sense of this are easie to be understood.

    French.

    Un an devant le conflict _Italique_,
    _Germains_, _Gaulois_, _Espagnols_ pour le Fort,
    Cherra l’Escole maison de republique,
    Ou horsmis peu, seront suffoquez morts.

    English.

    One year before the _Italian_ fight,
    _Germans_, _French_, _Spaniards_ for the Fort,
    The School-house of the Common-wealth shall fall,
    Where, except few, they shall be suffocated, and dead.

ANNOT.

It seemeth there should be a Battle between the _Italians_, _Germans_,
_French_, _Spaniards_ for a Fort, which I suspect to have been that of
_Serizoles_, wherein all those Nations were engaged, and that one year
before that Battle, the publick house of a _Common-wealth_ should fall,
and kill abundance of people; But of this I could find nothing in History.


XL.

    French.

    Un peu apres non point long intervalle,
    Par Mer & Terre sera fait grand tumulte,
    Beaucoup plus grande sera pugne Navalle,
    Feu, Animaux, qui plus feront d’Insulte.

    English.

    A little while after, without any great distance of time,
    By Sea and Land shall a great tumult be made,
    The Sea fight shall be much greater,
    Fire and Beasts which shall make greater insult.

ANNOT.

This hath a Relation to a foregoing Stanza, and likewise is not hard to
be understood.


XLI.

    French.

    La grand Estoile par sept jours bruslera,
    Nuce fera deux Soleils apparoir,
    Le gros mastin toute nuit hurlera,
    Quand grand Pontife changera de terroir.

    English.

    The great Star shall burn for the space of seven days,
    A Cloud shall make two Suns appear,
    The big Mastif shall houl all night,
    When the great Pope shall change his Countrey.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that those three Prodigies, contained in the
first three Verses, shall appear when a _Pope_ changeth his Countrey.


XLII.

    French.

    A Coq, Chiens, & Chats de sang seront repeus,
    Et de la playe du Tyran trouvé Mort,
    Au lict d’un autre, Jambes & Bras rompus,
    Qui n’avoit peu mourir de cruel Mort.

    English.

    A Cock, Dogs, and Cats shall be fed with Blood,
    And with the wound of the Tyrant found dead,
    In the bed of another, with Legs and Arms broken,
    Who could not die before by a cruel Death.

ANNOT.

These words signifie, that a great man or Tyrant shall be found dead in
another mans Bed, having his _Legs_ and _Arms_ broken, the body of which
shall be devoured by these three kinds of Creatures, a _Cock_, a _Dog_,
and a _Cat_. The last Verse signifieth that this Tyrant had escaped a
_cruel Death_.


XLIII.

    French.

    Durant l’estoile cheuelue apparente,
    Les trois grand Princes seront faits ennemis,
    Frappez du Ciel, Paix, Terre tremulente,
    _Arne_, _Tibre_, undans Serpent sur le bord mis.

    English.

    During the hairy apparent Star,
    The three great Princes shall be made Enemies,
    Struck from Heaven, Peace, quaking Earth,
    _Arne_, _Tyber_, full of Surges, Serpent cast upon the Shore.

ANNOT.

In the year 1556. upon the first day of _March_ appeared a blazing Star
which lasted three Months, and in that year the three great Princes were
made Enemies, _viz._ _Paul_ IV. Pope, _Henry_ II. King of _France_, and
_Philip_ II. King of _Spain_, about the breaking of the Truce by _Henry_
II.

The Affairs not succeeding according to the Pope’s, and the King of
_France_’s desire, they made Peace with the _Spaniard_ the 14th of
_October_ 1557. and because it was an effect of Gods Providence, which
moved the Pope’s, and the Kings hearts; the Author saith, they were
_struck from Heaven_.

After this _Peace_ the Author mentions an _Earth-quake_, which is very
likely considering the overflowing of the _Tyber_, which followed
immediately.

The night after, that _Peace_ was proclaimed at _Rome_, on a _Tuesday_
the _Tyber_ did so overflow his Banks, that the inundation was thought
the greatest that ever was, yea greater than that which happened in the
year 1530. under _Clement_ VII.

There were ten or twelve Mills carried away, all the Vine-yards along the
_Tyber_, from _Pontemole_ to St. _Peters_ Church, were buried under the
Sands, that the water carried.

Abundance of Houses fell to the ground. In _Rome_ many Gardens and houses
of pleasure were destroyed, the loss of the Wines, Hay, Wood, and Corn
could not be valued.

In _Florence_ the River of _Arno_ did more mischief than the _Tyber_ at
_Rome_, the History of the Genealogy of the house of _Medicis_, made
by _Peter de Boissat_, mentioneth, that in some places of the City of
_Florence_, the water overflowed to the heigth of eight Fathoms, and
covered all the valley of _Arne_.

The damage was yet greater at _Empoly_, a Town in _Tuscany_, where, of
three thousand people, there escaped but eighteen.

But to return to _Tyber_, its waters being retired into their Channel,
left so much mud, where it had overflowed, that no body could walk
upon it, and upon that mud near the _Tyber_, was a Serpent seen of a
prodigious bigness, which was killed by the Countrey people.

This is the Authors meaning in the last Verse, _Arne, Tyber, full of
Surges, Serpent cast upon the Shore_.

In the third Verse he saith, those three Princes were struck or moved
from Heaven to make _Peace_, that is, from God; every one considering
that this War was only for their mutual distruction.

The Vulgar impression putteth in the fourth Verse, _Pau_, _Tyber_, in
stead of _Arne_, _Tyber_, which is a visible fault; for the History
mentioneth only the inundation of those two Rivers in _Italy_, it may be
that the likeness of those words, _Pau_ and _Arne_, is the cause of the
mistake; as also because the name of _Pau_, which is the biggest River
in _Italy_, is more famous in History than that of _Arne_, which is the
River that passeth through _Florence_.


XLIV.

    French.

    L’Aigles poussée entour de Pavillons,
    Par autre oiseaux d’Entour sera chassé,
    Quand bruit de Timbres, Tubes, & Sonaillons,
    Rendront le sens de la Dame insensée.

    English.

    The Eagle flying among the Tents,
    By other Birds shall be driven away,
    When noise of Cymbals, Trumpets, and Bells,
    Shall render the sense to the Lady that was without it.

ANNOT.

It is an Eagle driven from the Tents by other Birds, when a mad Lady
shall recover her senses by the noise of Cymbals, Trumpets, and Bells.


XLV.

    French.

    Trop le Ciel pleure l’_Androgyn_ procrée,
    Pres de Ciel sang humain respandu,
    Par mort trop tard grand peuple recrée,
    Tard & tost vient le secours attendu.

    English.

    The Heaven bemoaneth too much the _Androgyn_ born,
    Near Heaven humane blood shall be spilt,
    By death too late a great people shall be refreshed,
    Late and soon cometh the succours expected.

ANNOT.

_Androgyn_, is one that is Male and Female, from the Greek word ἀνηρ,
which signifieth a Male, and γυνή, which signifieth a Female; the meaning
then of the first Verse is, that some great persons, suppose a King and
Queen, which he calleth Heaven, by reason of their exaltation above the
common sort of people, shall bemoan too long one of their Children, that
was, or shall be born Male and Female.

The second Verse is easie to be understood, if you take Heaven in the
same sense that we have said. The last two Verses are plain.


XLVI.

    French.

    Apres grand troche humain, plus grand sapreste,
    Le grand Moteur les siecles renouvelle,
    Pluye, Sang, Lait, Famine, Fer & Peste,
    Au Ciel veu feu courant longue estincelle.

    English.

    After a great humane change, another greater is nigh at hand,
    The great Motor reneweth the Ages,
    Rain, Blood, Milk, Famine, Sword, Plague,
    In the Heaven shall be seen a running fire with long sparks.

ANNOT.

_Troche_ in Greek is a Pulley, the meaning therefore of the Author, that
after a great mutation, God shall renew the Ages, and according to his
promise shall create a new Heaven, and a new Earth.

By those prodigies related in the two last Verses, it seemeth the Author
intendeth to speak of the last day, and of the fore-runners of it.


XLVII.

    French.

    L’Ennemy grand viel, deult, meurt de poison,
    Les Souverains par infinis subjugues,
    Pierres pleuvoir cache soubs la Toison,
    Par mort Articles en vain sont alleguez.

    English.

    The great and old Enemy grieveth, dieth by Poison,
    An infinite number of Soveraign’s conquered,
    It shall rain stones, they shall hide under Rocks,
    In vain shall death alledge Articles.

ANNOT.

This hath a relation to the foregoing Stanza, and is as it were the
second part of it. For as the foremost speaketh of the last day, so doth
this of Dooms-day.

First, he saith that _the great and old Enemy grieveth and dieth by
Poison_, that’s the Devil who shall be cast into a Lake of Fire and
Brimstone. The second Verse signifieth, that all the Kings of the Earth
shall be subdued by him that is _Lord of Lords and King of Kings_. The
third Verse expresseth, the anguish of the reprobate, when they shall cry
to the Rocks, hide us, and to the Mountains, fall upon us. And the fourth
Verse saith, that Death shall alledge in vain, the Articles she made with
the Devil, and his Angels.


XLVIII.

    French.

    La grand Copie qui passera les Monts,
    _Saturne_, _Aries_, tournant au Poisson _Mars_,
    Venins cachez sous testes de Moutons,
    Leur chef pendu a fil de _Polemars_.

    English.

    The great Army that shall pass over the Mountains,
    _Saturn_, _Aries_, _Mars_, turning to the Fishes,
    Poisons hidden in Sheeps heads,
    Their Captain hang’d with a thred of _Polemars_.

ANNOT.

_Paradin_ relateth in his History, that after the Duke of _Alba_ had
relieved _Vulpian_ with Victuals, which was done from the 22. of _July_
to the first of _August_, a Captain of the Emperors Army named _la
Trinité_, went out of _Valfrenieres_ the same first day of _August_, to
plunder the Countrey of _Piemont_.

He had 400 Horses, and 500 Foot: The news being brought to the Marshal
of _Brissac_, he sent out a great number of Horses, who did utterly
destroy their Foot, so that but thirty escaped, to carry the news to
_Valfrenieres_.

The _Spanish_ Horse, seeing the _French_ in such a fury, ran away, and
got some to _Ast_, some to _Alexandria_.

After that, the _Spaniards_ seeking to revenge themselves, took a Castle
three miles from _Cazal_, called _Frezene_, or _Fracinet du Pau_, where
they hanged up the Captain, put to the sword all the _Italians_, and sent
all the _French_ to the _Galleys_.

This proceeding being not according to the Laws of Arms, we may believe,
that the victorious discovered a malitious craft of the vanquished,
who had left some Sheeps-heads poisoned, to revenge themselves of the
victorious, which obliged the _Spaniards_ to serve so the Captain, the
_Italians_ and the _French_; and because the _French_ were not so ill
used, as the _Italians_, we may judge that the _Italians_ were the chief
contrivers of this business.

Therefore the Author foreseeing this, saith, that the great Army of the
_French_, which shall go over the Mountains, shall come to this mischief,
because of the poison that was hidden in the Sheeps heads.

The Vulgar impression erreth much in putting _Salmons_, for _Muttons_;
for every body knoweth that the _Salmons_ do not come into the Mountains
of _Montserrat_, and that in the Month of _August_ it is not a meat fit
for Souldiers, therefore in stead of _Salmons_, we have put _Muttons_, or
Sheep.

_The Captain was hanged with a thread of Polemars_, that is, with a
Match, of which, I am perswaded, that one certain _Polemars_ was the
Inventor.

The Author saith in the second Verse, that the time when this accident
happened, was, when _Saturn_ was in _Aries_, the Vulgar impression
putteth _Are_ in stead of _Aries_, but that’s false, therefore set down
_Aries_. _Saturn_ was in that Sign in the year 1555. from the 20th of
_February_, to the 14th of _July_, where from the 12th degree and four
Minutes, he began to retrograde in the same Sign of _Aries_, till the
18th of _November_, so that _Saturn_ was almost all that year in _Aries_.

He saith also that _Mars_ was going back to _Pisces_; because in that
same year, _Mars_ that was gone out of the Sign of _Pisces_ from the 19
of _March_ 1554. was retrograding to come back again into it upon the
20th of _January_ 1556.

Thus the Author meaneth, that this accident should happen in the year
that _Saturn_ should be in _Aries_, and _Mars_ should be near the Sign of
_Pisces_.

And to say truth, in the Month of _August_, _Mars_ was in the Sign
of _Scorpio_; upon the 23 of _September_, he entred into that of
_Sagitarius_; the third of _November_, into that of _Capricornus_; the
12th of _December_ into that of _Aquarius_; and the year following,
_viz._ 1556. into that of _Pisces_; so that _Mars_ was returning into
_Pisces_, which is the end of its particular motion.

By this Astrological and Historical discourse we correct the Vulgar
impression, which putteth turning from _Pisces_, _Mars_, in stead of
which, we put, turning to _Pisces_, _Mars_, which we do by changing
only _from_, into _to_, and sheweth us how careful we ought to be in
the explication of these Stanza’s, when the time is prefixed to us by
Astronomical calculations.

The Authors Phrase doth confirm us in this correction, when he useth this
word _turning_, which signifieth the motion that tendeth towards its end,
and not the motion that cometh from its end.


XLIX.

    French.

    Les conseillers du premier Monopole,
    Les Conquerans seduits par la _Melite_,
    _Rhodes_, _Bisance_ pour leur exposant pole,

    English.

    The advisers of the first Monopoly,
    The Conquerors seduced by the _Melite_,
    _Rhodes_, _Bizance_, for exposing their Pole,
    The ground shall fail the followers of runaways.

ANNOT.

All the difficulty of this lieth in the signification of the word _Pole_,
which in Greek signifieth a City. The word _Monopoly_ is Vulgar, and
signifieth when one or few would engross all the Trade of a Town. The
rest is so obscure, that I had rather leave it to the liberty of the
Reader, than break my Brains about it, considering chiefly that I am
going to bed, the precedent Stanza having exhausted all my Spirits, and
so farewell till to morrow.

    French.

    Quand ceux d’_Hainault_, de _Gand_, & de _Bruxelles_,

    English.

    When these of _Hainault_, of _Gand_, and of _Bruxelles_,
    Shall see the Siege laid before _Langres_,
    Behind their sides shall be cruel Wars,
    The old wound shall be worse then Enemies.

ANNOT.

_Hainault_ is a Province of the Low-Countries, and _Gand_ the chief
Town in _Flanders_, and _Bruxelles_ the chief Town of the Dukedome of
_Brabant_.

_Langres_ is a City in _France_, in the Province of _Champagne_, which is
called the Maiden Town; because it was never besieged. The rest is easie.


LI.

    French.

    Le sang du juste a _Londres_ fera faute,
    Bruslez par feu de vingt & trois les Six,
    La Dame antique cherra de place haute,
    De mesme secte plusieurs seront occis.

    English.

    The blood of the just shall be wanting in _London_,
    Burnt by fire of three and twenty, the Six,
    The antient Dame shall fall from her high place,
    Of the same Sect many shall be killed.

ANNOT.

Leaving unto the impartial Reader his liberty to judge of this Prophecy,
we for our part understand by it the impious and execrable murder,
committed upon the person of our last most gracious Sovereign King
_Charles_ I. of blessed memory, to whose expiation it seemeth our Author
attributeth the conflagration of _London_. By that proportion _of three
and twenty, the Six_, is to be understood the number of Houses and
Buildings that were burnt, which is about the proportion of three in
four, and cometh near to the computation, as also by that _three twenties
and Six_, may be understood the year 66. _By the antient Dame that shall
fall from the high place_, is understood the Cathedral Church of St.
_Paul_, which in the time of Paganism was dedicated to _Diana_, meant
here by the title of an antient Dame, the _fall from her high place_,
hath relation both to the sumptuousness and height of her building, as
also to her situation, which is in the most eminent place of the City.

By this Verse, _Of the same Sect many shall be killed_, is signified the
great number of other Churches even the number of 87 (which he intimateth
here by the name of the same Sect), that should be involved in the same
woful conflagration.

    Dans plusieurs nuits la Terre tremblera,

    English.

    During many nights the Earth shall quake,
    About the Spring two great Earth-quakes shall follow one another,
    _Corinth_, _Ephesus_ shall swim in the two Seas,
    War shall be moved by two great Wrestlers.

ANNOT.

_Corinth_ is a City of _Grecia_ and _Ephesus_ one of _Asia_; the rest is
plain.


LIII.

    French.

    Le grande Peste de cité maritime,
    Ne cessera que Mort ne soit vengée,

    English.

    The great Plague of the Maritime City,
    Shall not cease till the death be revenged
    Of the just blood by price condemned without crime,
    Of the great Dame not fainedly abused.

ANNOT.

This is a confirmation of the LI. Stanza and foretelleth the great Plague
we have had here in the year 1665. which he saith shall not cease till
the death of the Just blood, meaning King _Charles_ the I. be avenged who
was as is here expressed, condemned without crime, and sold for a Price.

By the great Dame unfainedly abused, he meaneth the sumptuous Cathedral
of St. _Paul_, which was polluted and made a Stable by those prophane
wretches.

    By a strange people and remote Nation,
    The great City near the water shall be much troubled,
    The Girl without great difference for a portion,
    Shall take the Captain, the Lock having not been pickt.

ANNOT.

In the explication of this mystical Stanza, I believe every body may be
as wise as I.


LV.

    Dans le conflit le grand qui peu valoit,

    English.

    In the fight the great one who was but little worth,
    At his last endeavour shall do a wonderful thing.
    While _Adria_ shall see what was wanting,
    In the Banquet he shall stabb the proud one.

ANNOT.

This is concerning some eminent person, who having shewed no great valour
in a Battle, shall nevertheless in a Banquet be so bold as to stab a
person of quality, that was proud.

This accident must happen somewhere about _Venice_, because he saith that
_Adria_, which is taken for _Venice_ shall look on.


LVI.

    English.

    He whom neither Plague, nor Sword could destroy,
    Shall die in the Rain being stricken with Thunder,
    The Abbot shall die when he shall see ruined,
    Those in the Shipwrack, striving to catch hold of the Rock.

ANNOT.

There is two accidents contained in this Stanza, the first is in the
two first Verses, where he saith that some considerable person, who had
escaped the Sword, and the Plague shall be strucken by the Thunder, and
die in a great showr of Rain.

The second is, in the two last Verses, where he saith, an Abbot shall
perish by Shipwrack, thinking to save himself by holding the Rock.

    Before the Battle the great one shall fall,
    The great one to death too sudden and bewailed;
    One shall be born half perfect, the most part shall swim,
    Near the River the Earth shall be dyed with blood.

ANNOT.

The words are plain enough, but of the sense every one may think what he
pleaseth.

    Without foot or hand, sharp and strong tooth,
    By a Globe, in the middle of the Port, and the first born,
    Near the Gate shall be transported by a Traitor,
    _Seline_ shineth, the little great one carried away.

ANNOT.

The sense of the whole is this, that an Infant begot by some person of
quality shall be exposed in the night time, the Moon Shining, which he
calleth _Seline_, from the Greek word σεληνη, which signifieth the Moon.


LIX.

    Of great _Neptune_ and his Tridentary Soldiers
    Shall gnaw _Provence_ by keeping great company,
    Besides, _Mars_ shall plague _Narbon_ by Javelins and Darts.

ANNOT.

Here be two things designed in this Stanza one is concerning _Provence_,
which shall be eaten up by Soldiers, and the other concerning the City
of _Narbon_, which shall be Besieged, or the Citizens fall out among
themselves.


LX.

    Great _Jud._ and _Rhosne_, _Loire_ and _Tag._ shall be changed,
    When the Mules hunger shall be satisfied,
    The Fleet scattered, Blood and Bodies shall swim.

ANNOT.

The Punick Faith in Latine _Punica fides_, a false Faith, was so
called from the _Carthaginians_, called in Latine _Pæni_, which was an
unfaithful Nation.

I do not know what he meaneth by great _Jud._ as for _Rhosne_, _Loire_
and _Tag_, they are three Rivers, the two first in _France_, the last is
the River of _Lisbone_ called in Latine _Tagus_. The rest is easie.

    O _Trojan_ blood death is at the harbour of the Arrow,
    Beyond the River the Ladder shall be raised against the Fort,
    Points, fire, great murder upon the breach.

ANNOT.

_Agen_ and _Tonneins_ are two Towns in _Gascony_, _Gironde_ is a River
that passeth in that Countrey, the sense therefore of the whole is, that
there shall be great Wars, and fightings in those Towns, as also upon
that River, which happened in the time of the civil Wars in _France_, as
every body may read in the _Annals_, and also in the Commentaries of the
Lord of _Monluck_.

    Of people and beasts shall be an horrible destruction,
    Then on a sudden the vengeance shall be seen,
    Blood, Hand, Thirst, Famine, when the Comet shall run.

ANNOT.

Here is nothing hard but who should be this _Mabus_, at last I found by
transposition of Letters that he meaneth _Ambus_, which was the name of
the Heades man that beheaded the Duke of _Montmorency_ at _Thoulouse_,
how miraculous therefore appeareth our Author, who did not only foretell
general things, but also particular accidents, even the names of the
persons that were to be born a hundred years after.


LXIII.

    English.

    The _French_ shall a little subdue _Ausonne_,
    _Pau_, _Marne_, and _Seine_ shall make _Perme l’Urie_,
    Which shall raise a great Wall against them,
    From the less to the Wall the great one shall loose his life.

ANNOT.

_Ausonne_ is always taken by the Author for the City of _Bordeaux_,
because _Ausonius_ a famous Latine Poet was born there, the rest is so
obscure, and the text so corrupted, that I had rather leave it to the
liberty of the Reader, then to become ridiculous, by not acknowledging my
ignorance.

    A near hope shall come when they shall be fainting,
    The _Gebenna_ Law shall be upon a quaking point,

Here you must observe that _Gebenna_ in Latine signifieth _Geneva_, and
therefore this whole Stanza is concerning the City of _Geneva_.

    _Mercure_ en l’_Ar_, _Saturn_ fenera.

    English.

    The Park enclineth to great calamity,
    Which shall be through _Hesperia_ and _Insubria_,
    The Fire in the Ship, Plague, and Captivity,
    _Mercury_ in _Aries_, _Saturn_ shall wither.

ANNOT.

Though the words be plain, nevertheless the sense is very obscure, and
chiefly as I suppose by the faults of the impression, all what I can tell
you here, is, that _Hesperia_ in Latine, is _Spain_, and _Insubria_, is
_Savoy_.


LXVI.

    French.

    Par grand dangers le Captif eschapé,
    Peu de temps grand a fortune changée,
    Dans le Palais le peuple est attrapé,
    Par bonne augure la Cité assiegée.

    English.

    The Prisoner escaped through great danger,
    A little while after shall become great, his fortune being changed,
    In the Palace the people shall be caught,
    And by a good Sign the City shall be besieged.

ANNOT.

All this is plain, both in the words and the Sense.

    English.

    The fair one shall fight with the forked Nose,
    In Duel, and expel him out,
    He shall re-establish the banished,
    Putting the stronger of them in Maritine places.

ANNOT.

Both the Sense and the words are plain.


LXVIII.

    French.

    De l’Aquilon les efforts seront grands,
    Sur l’Occean sera la Porte ouverte,
    Le Regne en l’Isle sera re-integrand,
    Tremblera _Londres_ par voiles descouvertes.

    English.

    The endevours of the North shall be great,
    Upon the Ocean the gate shall be open,
    The Kingdom in the Island shall be re-established,
    _London_ shall quake, for fear of Sails discovered.

ANNOT.

This is a very remarkable one, which hath been fulfilled since the happy
restauration of his sacred Majesty King _Charles_ II. now Reigning: For
the endevours of the North, (_viz._ the _Dutch_) have been very great.
The _ocean_; like a _gate_, hath been open to all kind of Armies, to play
their pranks upon. His Majesty, and Kingdom, have been happily restored.


LXIX.

    French.

    Le Roy _Gaulois_ par la Celtique dextre,

    English.

    The _French_ King, by the Low-Countreys right hand,
    Seeing the discord of the great Monarchy,
    Upon three parts of it, will make his Scepter to flourish,
    Against the Cap of the great Hierarchy.

ANNOT.

This signifieth, that the _French_ King, through the discord that is in
the _Spanish_ Monarchy, shall cause his _Scepter to flourish_ upon three
parts of the _Netherlands_; notwithstanding the assistance of the King of
_Spain_, who is called here _the Cap of the great Hierarchy_; that is,
the great defender of the Popedom and Popery.


LXX.

    French.

    Le Dard du Ciel fera son estendue,
    Morts en parlant, grande execution,
    La pierre en larbre la fiere gent rendue,

    English.

    The Dart of Heaven shall make his circuit,
    Some die speaking, a great execution,
    The stone in the tree, the fierce people humbled,
    Humane noise, a Monster purged by expiation.

ANNOT.

All this Stanza signifieth nothing but a fearful Thunder and Lightning,
called here, _the Dart of Heaven_, that shall do a great deal of
mischief; for as he saith, _some shall die speaking_, there shall be
_a great execution_, the _Thunderbolt_ shall stick in the _Tree_,
_the people that was fierce, shall be humbled, and a Monster purged by
expiation_, that some notorious wicked person shall be consumed by that
Cœlestial fire.


LXXI.

    French.

    Les exiles en _Sicile_ viendront,

    Au point du jour les _Celtes_ luy faudront,

    English.

    The banished persons shall come into _Sicily_,
    To free the forrain Nation from hunger,
    In the dawning of the day the _Celtes_ shall fail them,
    Their Life shall be preserved, the King shall submit to reason.

ANNOT.

It is hard to judge what he meaneth by that _Forreign Nation_, which
shall be relieved in _Sicily_, by the banished, nor what _King_ is that
which _shall submit to reason_; let it be left to every body’s private
judgement.


LXXII.

    French.

    Armée _Celtique_ en _Italie_ vexée,
    De toutes partes conflit & grande perte,

    English.

    The _French_ Army shall be vexed in _Italy_,
    On all sides fighting, and great loss,
    The _Romans_ run away, and thou _France_ repulsed,
    Near the _Thesin_, by _Rubicon_ the fight shall be doubtful.

ANNOT.

A _French_ Army shall be distressed, if not destroyed in _Italy_. The
_Romans_, that is, those under the Pope, that shall take their part,
shall be put to flight, and this battle shall be fought by the River
_Thesin_. Another shall be fought by the River _Rubicon_, whose event
shall be doubtful, that is to say, it shall hardly be known who got the
victory.

    At the _Fucin_ Lake of the _Benacle_ Shore,
    Near the _Leman_, at the Port of _Lorguion_,
    Born with three Arms, a Warlike Image,
    By three Crowns to the great _Endimion_.

ANNOT.

There is a Lake in _Italy_ called _Lacus Fucinius_; the Lake of _Geneva_
is called _Lacus Lemanus_; the meaning then of this obscure Stanza, is,
(if I understand any thing) that a Monster shall be _born with three
Arms_, near one of those Lakes, which shall be a sign of great Wars: what
he meaneth by the _three Crowns to the great Endymion_, is unknown to me.


LXXIV.

    French.

    De _Sens_, d’_Autun_ viendront jusques au _Rhosne_,

    English.

    They shall come from _Sens_ and _Autun_, as far as the _Rhosne_,
    To go further to the _Pyrenean_ Mountains,
    The Nation come from the Mark of _Ancona_,
    By Land and Sea shall follow speedily after.

ANNOT.

_Sens_ and _Autun_ are two Cities in _France_, the _Pyrenean_ Mountains,
are those which divide _France_ from _Spain_.


LXXV.

    French.

    La voix ouie de l’Insolit oiseau,
    Sur le Canon du respiral estage,
    Si haut viendra du froment le boisseau,

    English.

    The noise of the unwonted Bird having been heard,
    Upon the Canon of the highest story,
    The Bushel of Wheat shall rise so high,
    That man of man shall be _Antropophage_.

ANNOT.

This is a prediction of a mighty Famine, wherein men shall eat up one
another, when an _unwonted Bird_ shall be seen and heard to cry, being
perched upon one of the biggest pieces of _Ordinance_.

_Antropophage_ is a Greek word, signifying a _Man-eater_, from ἄνθροπος,
_homo_, and φαγος, _comedens_, of which sort of men there be too many
already.


LXXVI.

    French.

    English.

    Lightning in _Burgundy_, with marvellous accidents,
    Which could never have been done by art,
    Of their Senate _Sacriste_ being lamed,
    Shall make known the business to the enemies.

ANNOT.

The _Senate_ or Parliament of _Burgundy_, sits at _Dijon_, among them
there is always a Church-man, that is one of the Judges, to see that
nothing be done to the prejudice of the Church. I suspect that it is he,
that is called here _Sacriste_, and who shall reveal the business to the
_Enemies_. The two first Verses need no explication.


LXXVII.

    French.

    Cries and howlings shall be heard about midnight,
    They shall get in through the broken Walls,
    The betrayers shall run away through the Conduits.

It is a Town Besieged, where after a repulse given to the Besiegers, they
shall get in by the Treason of some within, who shall run away through
the Conduits or Channels of the Town.


LXXVIII.

    French.

    Le grand _Neptune_ du profond de la Mer,
    De sang punique & sang _Gaulois_ meslé,
    Les Isles a sang pour le tardif ramer,
    Plus luy nuira que loccult mal celé.

    English.

    The great _Neptune_ in the middle of the Sea,
    Having joyned _African_ and _French_ blood,
    The Islands shall be put to the Sword, and the slow rowing
    Shall do them more prejudice, than the concealed evil.

ANNOT.

To understand this, you must know that Henry the II. King of _France_,
having renewed his Alliance with the Grand Seignior _Sultan Solyman_,
he asked him succours for to take _Nice_, which he pretended to belong
to the Earldom of _Provence_. To that purpose the Marshal of _Brissac_
went from Court with the Kings Army in the year 1557. to set upon _Nice_,
_Savona_, and _Genoa_, and so to hinder the _Spaniard_ from coming by
Sea in _Piemont_, and the _Milanese_. The _Turk_ sent him a good Fleet,
consisting of 105. Galleys, and 14. Galliots.

The _French_ Fleet consisted of 26 Galleys, of which the great Prior was
Admiral, who went with them from the Castle of _Yf_, the 9. of _June_
1558.

Being at Sea, and not knowing where the _Turkish_ Fleet was, he went to
and fro to seek it out, at last he found it pillaging and plundering
the Island of _Minorica_. The _Turks_ had already taken the chief Town,
where 800. _Turks_ were killed, which so incensed the rest, that they set
the Town on fire; then going up and down the Countrey, they took 5000.
Prisoners, and if the Lords of _Carces_ and _Vence_ had not stayed them,
they would have ruinated the whole Island.

Then forsaking the Island, they joyned with the _French_, but the
perfidious _Bassa_ being bribed by the _Genoeses_, and those of _Nice_,
went slowly to work, and at last retreated without doing any thing for
the _French_. This is the relation of _Cæsar Nostradamus_, in his History
of _Provence_ under _Henry_ the II. and according to this the Author
saith, that _the great Neptune in the middle of the Sea, shall joyn
~French~ and ~African~ blood_. _Neptune_ signifieth the _Mediterranean
Sea_.

_The Islands shall be put to the Sword_, by the taking of _Minorica_,
after which the _Turks_ being bribed, went slowly to work, and in
conclusion did nothing of consequence.

The third and fourth Verse adds, that this _Bassa_’s slow rowing, _shall
do them more prejudice then the concealed evil_; that is, shall do more
damage to the _French_ by his hidden design of the Bassa of not serving
the _French_; because this slowness of the Bassa spoiled the _French_
activity, lessened their provisions, and at last discouraged them;
whereas if the _Turks_ had not come, the _French_ Galleys alone were able
to take _Nice_.


LXXIX.

    French.

    La Barbe crespe & noire par engin,
    Subjuguera la gent cruelle & fiere,
    Le grand _Cheyren_ ostera du longin,
    Tous les Captifs par _Seline_ Baniere.

    English.

    The frizled and black Beard by fighting,
    Shall overcome the fierce and cruel Nation,
    The great _Cheyren_ shall free from Bands,
    All the Captives made by _Selyne_ Standard.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was fulfilled in the year 1571. upon the seventh day of
_October_, when that famous Battle of _Lepanto_ was fought between the
Christians and the Turks, the General of the Christians being _Don Juan
of Austria_, whom he calleth here the _frizled and black Beard_.

In this Battle the Christians lost 7566. men, and the Turks about 32000.
besides 220. Ships of all sorts, and all the Christian slaves released
that were in them. By the _Selyne_ Banner is understood that of the great
Turk, whose name at that time was _Selyne_. By the great _Cheyren_ is
understood _Henry_ the II. King of _France_, who redeemed many slaves,
for _Cheyren_ by transposition of Letters is _Henry_.


LXXX.

    French.

    Apres conflit du læse l’Eloquence,
    Par peu de temps se trame Saint repos,
    Point l’on admet les grand a delivrance.
    Des ennemis sont remis a propos.

    English.

    After the Battle, the eloquency of the wounded man,
    Within a little while shall procure a holy rest,
    The great ones shall not be delivered,
    But shall be left to their Enemies will.

ANNOT.

After the Battle of St. _Laurence_, the Prisoners taken by the _Spaniard_
were the Constable of _France_, the Dukes of _Montpensier_, of
_Longueville_, the Marshal S. _André_, _Ludovic_ Prince of _Mantua_, the
_Rhingrave_ Colonel of the _Germans_, the Earl of _la Rochefoucaud_, and
several other persons of quality.

They were Prisoners from the _10th_ of _August_ 1557. to the third of
_April_ 1559. that is, one year and eight Months; during which time the
Pope’s _Nuncios_, _Christierne_ Dutchess Dowager of _Lorraine_, the
Constable, and Marshal St. _André_ endeavoured to make the peace.

Among them the Constable was chief, and _Philip_ the II. King of _Spain_
gave him leave to go to and fro upon his Paroll; and of him it is our
Author speaketh in the first Verse; _After the Battle the eloquency of
the wounded man_, that is after the Battle of _Saint Laurence_, where the
Constable of _Monmorency_ was wounded in the hip. His eloquency procured
the peace, which was concluded in a short time, for had it not been for
the death of Queen _Mary_ of _England_, that happened upon the 15 of
_November_ 1558. it should have been concluded three Months after the
conference that was begun in the Abbey of _Cercamp_ near _Cambray_.

The third Verse saith, that _the great ones shall not be delivered_,
because during the Treaty of Peace, _Philip_ the II. would not hearken
to take any Ransom, but they were kept Prisoners till the Peace. It is
the meaning of the fourth Verse, when it saith, _but shall be left to the
Enemies will_, _viz._ the _Spaniards_ who gave them liberty after the
Peace.


LXXXI.

    French.

    Par feu du Ciel la Cité presqu’aduste,

    English.

    By fire from Heaven the City shall be almost burnt,
    The Waters threatens another _Deucalion_,
    _Sardaigne_ shall be vexed by an _African_ Fleet,
    After that _Libra_ shall have left her _Phaeton_.

ANNOT.

All is plain but the last Verse, the sense of which is, that the things
before spoken, shall happen when the Sun is newly come out of the sign of
_Libra_.


LXXVII.

    French.

    Par faim la proye fera Loup prisonier,
    L’Assaillant lors en extresme detresse,
    Lesnay ayant au devant le dernier,
    Le grand neschape au milieu de la presse.

    English.

    By hunger, the prey shall make the Wolf prisoner,
    Assaulting him then in a great distress,
    The eldest having got before the last,
    The great one doth not escape in the middle of the crowd.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses signifie, that an hungry Wolf seeking for a Prey,
shall be caught in some trap, where being almost famished, the Prey shall
assault him. The last two Verses being obscure and not material to any
thing I have neglected them.


LXXXIII.

    French.

    Le gros Traffic d’un grand Lion changé,
    La pluspart tourne en pristine ruine,
    Proye aux Soldats par playe vendangé,
    Par _Jura Mont_, & _Sueve_ bruine.

    English.

    The great Trade of a great Lion alter’d,
    The most part turneth into its former ruine,
    Shall become a Prey to Soldiers and reaped by wound,
    In _Mont-Jura_, and _Suaube_ great Foggs.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning the City of _Lion_ in _France_, which is
a Town of an exceeding great Trade, and is threatned to suffer an
alteration, and a decay by War.

The last Verse is concerning a great Mist or Fogg, which shall be upon
_Mont-Jura_ and in _Suabeland_.


LXXXIV.

    French.

    Entre _Campagne_, _Sienne_, _Pise_ & _Ostié_,
    Six mois neuf jours ne pleuvra une goute,
    L’Estrange Langue en Terre _Dalmatie_,

    English.

    Between _Campania_, _Sienna_, _Pisa_ and _Ostia_,
    For six Months and nine days there shall be no rain,
    The strange Language in _Dalmatia_’s Land,
    Shall overrun, spoiling all the Countrey.

ANNOT.

All those places mentioned, in the first Verse are seated in _Italy_; the
Author saith that in that Countrey it shall not rain for the space of six
Months and nine days, which if it be past, or to come, I know not.

The two last Verses signifie, that a strange Nation shall come into
_Dalmatia_, and overrun and spoil all that Countrey.


LXXXV.

    French.

    Le vieux plein barbe soubs le statut severe,
    A Lion fait dessus l’Aigle Celtique,
    Le petit grand trop outre persevere,
    Bruit d’Arme au Ciel, Mer rouge _Ligustique_.

    English.

    The old plain beard under the severe Statute,
    Made at _Lion_ upon the _Celtique_ Aigle,
    The little great persevereth too far,
    Noise of Arms in the Skie, the _Ligustrian_ Sea made red.

ANNOT.

I could scrape no sense out of the first three Verses; the last
signifieth, that a noise of Arms shall be heard in the Skies, and that
the _Ligustrian_ Sea, which is that of _Genoa_, shall be made red with
blood, when the former prodigy hath appeared.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    Naufrage a classe pres d’Onde _Adriatique_,
    La Terre tremble emeue sur l’Air en Terre mis
    _Ægypt_ tremble augment Mahometique,
    L’Heraut soy rendre a crier est commis.

    English.

    A Fleet shall suffer Shipwrack near the _Adriatick_ Sea,
    The Earth quaketh, a motion of the Air cometh upon the Land,
    _Ægypt_ trembleth for fear of the Mahometan increase.
    The Herald surrendring shall be appointed to cry.

ANNOT.

In the two first Verses is foretold a great storm by the _Adriatick_ Sea,
in which a Fleet shall be dispersed, and many suffer Shipwrack.

The two last Verses relate the great fear _Ægypt_ was in, when the great
Turk _Sultan Selyn_ went to conquer it.

The last Verse is concerning a Herald, which was surrendered to the
contrary party, and by them was appointed to perform that office in their
behalf.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    Apres viendra des extremes Contrées,
    Prince _Germain_ dessus Throsne d’Oré,
    La servitude & les Eaux rencontrées,

    English.

    After that shall come out of the remote Countreys,
    A _German_ Prince upon a gilded Throne,
    The slavery and waters shall meet,
    The Lady shall serve, her time no more worshipped.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning _Gustavus Adolphus_ King of _Swedeland_, who
is called _German_ Prince, because his Ancestors came out of _Germany_,
he came out of a remote Countrey, that is _Swedeland_, he came upon a
gilded Throne, that is a Ship gilded, he shall make slavery and waters
meet, because as soon as he was Landed he began to conquer, and to subdue
that Lady (_viz. Germania_) that was no more worshipped since as she was
before.


LXXXVIII.

    French.

    Le Circuit du grand fait ruineux,
    Le nom septiesme du cinquiesme sera,
    D’un tiers plus grand l’estrange belliqueux,
    De _Ram_, _Lutece_, _Aix_ ne garentira.

    English.

    The circumference of the ruinous building,
    The seventh name shall be that of the fifth,
    From a third, one greater, a Warlike man,
    _Aries_ shall not preserve _Paris_ nor _Aix_.

ANNOT.

The Circumference of that ruinous building, was the _French_ league
against _Henry_ III. and _Henry_ IV. which numbers being joyned together,
make seven, mentioned in the second Verse.

_By the strange Warlike man_, in the third Verse, is understood _Henry_
IV. because he was not born in _France_, but in _Navarre_, and therefore
called a stranger, who subdued both _Paris_ and _Aix_, seated under the
constellation of _Aries_. If you had not rather, by the name of the
_Ram_, or _Aries_, understand the Duke of _Mayenne_, who was head of the
league.


LXXXIX.

    French.

    Un jour seront amis les deux grands Maistres,
    Leur grand pouvoir se verra augmenté,
    La Terre neufue sera en ses hauts estres,

    English.

    One day the two great Masters shall be friends,
    Their great power shall be increased,
    The new Land shall be in a flourishing condition,
    The number shall be told to the bloody person.

ANNOT.

We must suppose here three Kings of _Europe_, two of which shall become
friends, and by their agreement, _the new Land_, that is, either the
Plantations, or the Trade either in the _East_ or _West Indies_, shall
flourish, their prosperities shall be related and told to the third King,
who shall be a bloody and cruel man.

    English.

    By Life and Death the Kingdom of _Hungary_ shall be changed,
    The Law shall be more severe than the service,
    Their great City shall be full of howling and crying,
    _Castor_ and _Pollux_ shall be enemies in the List.

ANNOT.

There shall happen a great change in the Kingdom of _Hungary_, caused by
the birth of one, and the death of another.

The meaning of the second Verse is, that it will be more tolerable to go
to War, than to Law.

The last verse signifieth, that this dissention shall happen between two
Brothers; because _Castor_ and _Pollux_ were such.


XCI.

    French.

    Stricken by the high born, a wonderful case,
    Great murder of Mankind, the taking of the great Neveu,
    Some dead looking, the proud one shall escape.

ANNOT.

This is a continuation of the former, relating more Prodigies that are to
happen.

    Near the _Tyber_, going towards _Lybia_,
    A little before a great Innundation,

    Great _Pau_ shall receive great harm by the _French_,
    A vain terrour shall seize upon the Maritine Lion,
    Infinite people shall go beyond Sea,
    Of which shall not escape a quarter of a Million.

ANNOT.

The first Verse signifieth that the Countrey about the _Pau_, (which is
the greatest River in _Italy_) shall receive great damage by the _French_.

The second, that the Maritine Lion, _viz._ the _Hollanders_ shall fear in
vain. The third and fourth are plain.

This needeth no interpretation.

    Near the end and beginning of the _Rhosne_,
    Famine, Sword, too late succours shall be provided,
    _Persia_ shall come against _Macedonia_.

ANNOT.

This is easie.


XCVII.

    French.

    _Romain Pontife_ garde de taprocher,
    De la Cité que deux fleuves arrouse,
    Ton sang viendras aupres de la cracher,
    Toy & les tiens quand fleurira la Rose.

    English.

    _Roman Pontife_ take heed to come near,
    To the City watered with two Rivers,
    Thou shall spit there thy blood,
    Thou and thine, when the Rose shall blossom.

ANNOT.

Although there may be many Cities watered with two Rivers, yet I know
none more famous than _Lions_ in _France_, where two famous Rivers, the
_Rhosne_ and the _Saone_ meet together, and I believe this is the place
that our Author forewarneth the _Pope_ to come to, for fear of his death,
and that of his attendants.


XCVIII.

    French.

    Celuy du sang respersé le visage,
    De la Victime proche du Sacrifice,
    Venant en _Leo_, augure par presage,
    Mis estre a mort alors pour la fiance.

    English.

    He that shall have his face bloody,
    With the blood of the Victim near to be sacrificed,
    The Sun coming into _Leo_ shall be an Augury by presage,
    That then he shall be put to death for his confidence.

ANNOT.

I suppose this to be spoken of a Jewish Priest, who going about to
practice the Ceremonial Law, in a Countrey where it is forbidden, shall
be put to death for his bold confidence.


XCIX.

    French.

    Terroir _Romain_ qu’interpretoit _Augure_,
    Par gent _Gauloise_ par trop sera vexée,
    Mais Nation _Celtique_ craindra l’heure,
    _Boreas_, classe trop loing l’avoit poussée.

    English.

    The _Roman_ Countrey in which the _Augur_ did interpret,
    Shall be too much vexed by the _French_ Nation,
    But the _Celtique_ Nation shall fear the hour,
    The Northwind had driven the Navy in too far.

ANNOT.

Since the Reign of _Henry_ the II. King of _France_, the Historians
do not mention that the Countrey about _Rome_ hath been troubled by
the _French_ Armies. It was only in the time of _Paul_ the IV. who was
assisted by the _French_ Troops, under the conduct of the Lord _Strozy_,
and Captain _Monluc_, therefore this Stanza belongeth to the time of that
Kings Reign.

And indeed what he foretelleth here, came to pass in the year 1556.
for the Countrey about _Rome_ was vexed by the _French_ Nation, who
went about then to take the places, which the Duke of _Alba_ had taken
from the _Pope_, and thereby caused those disorders, which commonly are
incident to War.

The second Verse saith, _the Countrey shall be too much vexed_, and not a
little, because _Monluc_, whom the Author calleth the _quick Gascon_, did
continually torment the Enemies, which could not be done without a great
prejudice to the Countrey; Moreover, his Troops being for the most part
_Gascons_, and consequently active men; the Soldiers did more harm than
ordinary.

In the first Verse he saith, that this Countrey about _Rome_ was marked
by an _Augury_, to be the place upon which the sad effect of the _Augury_
should fall, which proved true; for the first of _March 1556_, appeared a
Blazing Star, which did presage to that Countrey of _Rome_, its disaster.

_Roman Countrey in which the Augur did interpret_, that is to say, which
the _Augur_ did signifie, and presage should be vexed by the _French_
Nation.

Afterwards the Author saith, that the same _French_ Nation, or
_Celtique_, shall fear the hour when _Boreas_ should drive to far the
Fleet, that is to say, shall fear much, when the Baron _de la Garde_
was so troubled with the storm (as we have said) and in truth it was
_Boreas_, or the _Northwind_, that drove him into St. _Florents_ road.


C.

    French.

    Dedans les Isles si horrible tumulte,
    Rien on n’orra qu’une bellique brigue,
    Tant grand sera des predareurs l’Insult,
    Qu’on se viendra ranger a la grand ligue.

    English.

    In the Islands shall be so horrid tumults,
    That nothing shall be heard but a Warlike surprise,
    So great shall be the insult of the Robbers,
    That every one shall shelter himself under the great League.

ANNOT.

This is plain, if by the great League, you understand the soundest and
most powerful party.




THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ III.


I.

    French.

    Apres Combat & Bataille Navale,
    Le grand _Neptune_ a son plus haut beffroy,
    Rouge adversaire de peur de viendra pasle,
    Mettant le grand _Occean_ en effroy.

    English.

    After the fight and Sea Battle,
    The great _Neptune_ in his highest Steeple,
    The red adversary shall wax pale for fear,
    Putting the great _Occean_ in a fright.

ANNOT.

I find no mystical sence in this, unless by the red adversary he should
understand the _Pope_, because clothed in Scarlet. Therefore I leave the
explication to the judgement of every particular Reader.


II.

    French.

    Le Divin Verbe donra a la substance,
    Compris Ciel, Terre, or occult au lait mystique,
    Corps, Ame, Esprit, ayant toute puissance,
    Tant sous ses pieds comme au Siege Celique.

    English.

    The Divine Word shall give to the substance,
    Heaven and Earth, and Gold hid in the mystical milk,
    Body, Soul, Spirit, having all power,
    As well under his feet, as in the Heavenly Seat.

ANNOT.

I desire the judicious Reader, and chiefly if he be given to the
Hermetick Philosophy, to take a special notice of this Stanza, for in
it is contained the secret of the _Elixir_ or Philosophers Stone, more
clearly and plainly then in the _Tabula Smaragdina_ of _Hermes_, which to
make appearent, we shall expound it Verse by Verse.

_The Divine Word shall give to the substance_; by the Divine word you
must not understand the second person of the Trinity, but a Doctor in
Divinity or a Theologian, called in Greek θεόλογος or Divine word, who
shall be an _Adeptus_, a Disciple of _Hermes_, and one that shall attain
to the secret of the Philosophers stone.

That man shall give to the substance, that is, to Gold; _Heaven and
Earth, and gold hid in the mystical Milk_. Heaven and Earth, that is all
the Celestial and Terrestrial qualities, lurking in the Gold, which is
hid in the mystical milk, that is in the _Azoth_, or _Mercury_ of the
Philosophers.

_Body, Soul, Spirit, having all Power_, that is, the three principles, of
which the Philosophers say their stone is compounded, _viz. Body, Soul,
and Spirit_.

Having _all Power_, that is, having the power to transmute all Mettals
into its kind; as also having all the powers from above and below, as
_Hermes_ saith, _Pater ejus est ~Sol~, Mater vero ~Luna~, & Terra nutrix
ejus_.

Which is confirmed by the last Verse, _As well under his feet, as in the
Heavenly Seat_.


III.

    French.

    _Mars_ & _Mercure_, & Largent joint ensemble,
    Vers le Midy extreme siccité,
    Au fond d’_Asie_ on dira Terre tremble,
    _Corinthe_, _Ephese_ lors en perplexite.

    English.

    _Mars_ and _Mercury_, and Silver joyned together,
    Towards the South a great drought,
    In the bottome of _Asia_ shall be an Earth-quake,
    _Corinth_ and _Ephesus_ shall then be in perplexity.

ANNOT.

After the Author hath in the foregoing Stanza expressed the mistery
of the Philosophers stone, he seemeth to give here a receit, though
Sophistical, for the relief of the Inquisitors, and as it were a
_Viaticum_, for them to subsist till they can attain to the perfection,
as _Basilius_, _Valentinus_ hath done since to his disciples.

He saith then, that with _Mars_, that is, Iron, _Mercury_ and Silver
joyned together, some thing may be done, if you beware of a _drought
in the South_; that is, in the middle of the operation; and this is
concerning the two first Verses. Those that shall desire to be better
and further informed, may come to me, and they shall have all the
satisfaction I can afford them.

The two last Verses have no relation to the first two, and foretel onely
a great _Earthquake_ in _Asia_, by which, those two Towns, _Corinth_ and
_Ephesus_, shall be in great perplexity.


IV.

    French.

    Quand seront proches le defaut des Lunaires,
    De l’un a lautre ne distant grandement,
    Froid, siccité, dangers vers les frontieres,
    Mesme ou l’Oracle a pris commencement.

    English.

    When the want of the Luminaries shall be near,
    Not being far distant one from another,
    Cold, drought, danger towards the Frontiers,
    Even where the Oracle had his beginning.

ANNOT.

The word _near_, sheweth that the two Eclipses, one of the Sun and the
other of the Moon, shall be near one another.

The Ephemerides of _John Stadius_, teach us, that in the year 1556 in the
Month of _November_, these two Eclipses did meet. That of the Sun upon
the first of _November_, at 17 hours (as the Astrologers reckon) and 53
Minutes. That of the Moon at 12 hours and 43 Scruples; and thus the two
last Verses are plain.

Concerning the other two: _Belleforest_ teacheth us two things; the
first, that the same year was extraordinary dry, in so much that from
_April_ to _October_ it did not rain, but only upon the Eve of St. _John_
the Baptist, and that the Vintage was made in _August_, the Wine proving
excellent. The second is, that in the Month of _December_ began a horrid
Frost, which lasted a great while. Thus there was _Cold and drought_.

Concerning the dangers towards the Frontiers, _Belleforest_ saith, that
towards _Pickardy_ the _Spaniard_ began to break the truce, making
inrodes about _Abbeville_, St. _Spirit_ of _Rue_, _la Chapele_, _Rozoy_,
_Thierasse_, and _Aubenton_.

When complaints were made of it, they alledged their necessity and want
of Victuals; which did oblige the Lord Admiral to permit the Souldiers
retaliation; and in this manner, _there was danger towards the Frontiers_.

As for the Town where the _Oracle_ (that is, our Author) had his
beginning or birth, whether it be that of St. _Remy_ or _Salon de Craux_.
The dangers that were there, proceeded from the Civil Wars between the
Protestants and the _Roman_ Catholicks.


V.

    French.

    Pres le defaut des deux grands luminaires,
    Qui surviendra entre l’_Avril_ & _Mars_,
    O quel cherté! mais deux grands debonnaires,
    Par Terre & Mer secourront toutes parts.

    English.

    Near the Ecclipses of the two great Luminaries,
    Which shall happen between _April_ and _March_,
    O what a dearth! but two great ones bountiful,
    By Land and Sea shall succour them on all sides.

ANNOT.

There shall happen two great Ecclipses between _March_ and _April_, one
of the Sun, and the other of the Moon; then shall be a great dearth, but
the afflicted shall be relieved by the two powerful Princes of a good
Nature.


VI.

    French.

    Dans Temple clos le foudre y entrera.
    Des Citadins dedans leur fort grevez,
    Chevaux, Bœufs, Hommes, l’Onde mur touchera,
    Par faim, soif, soubs les plus foibles armez.

    English.

    Into a close Church the lightning shall fall,
    The Citizens shall be distressed in their Fort,
    Horses, Oxen, Men, the Water shall touch the Wall,
    By hunger, thirst, down shall come the worst provided.

ANNOT.

This is plain.


VII.

    French.

    Les fugitifs, feu du Ciel sur les Piques,
    Conflit prochain des Corbeaux sesbatans,
    De Terre on crie, aide, secours Celiques,
    Quand pres des murs seront les combatans.

    English.

    The runaways, fire of Heaven upon the Pikes,
    A fight near hand, the Ravens sporting,
    They cry from the Land, succours O Heavenly powers
    When near the walls shall be the fighting men.

ANNOT.

The first Verse signifieth, that there shall be some _Fugitives_, upon
whose _Pikes_ the Lightning shall fall.

The second, that when a multitude of _Ravens shall be sporting_, a great
fight shall be near hand.

The third, that there shall be a great exclamation and prayers, when the
Souldiers shall come near the wall to give an assault.


VIII.

    French.

    Les _Cimbres_ joints avecques leurs voisins,
    Depopuler viendront presque l’_Espagne_,
    Gens ramassez, _Guienne_ & _Limosins_,
    Seront en ligue & leur feront Compagne.

    English.

    The _Cimbres_ joyned with their neighbours,
    Shall come to depopulate almost all _Spain_,
    People gathered from _Guienna_ and _Limosin_,
    Shall be in league with them, and keep them Company.

ANNOT.

The _Cimbres_ and _Teutons_ were a Northern people, _viz_: the _Swedes_
and _Danes_, who came once out of their Countrey to sack _Rome_, and were
overcome by _Marius_, near the Town of _Orenge_, in a place where his
Triumphal Arch is seen to this day. The rest is easie.


IX.

    French.

    _Bourdeaux_, _Rouan_ & la _Rochelle_ joints,
    Tiendront autour la grand Mer Occeane,
    _Anglois Bretons_, & les _Flamans_ conjoints,
    Les chasseront jusque aupres de _Rouane_.

    English.

    _Bourdeaux_, _Rouan_, and _Rochel_ joyned together,
    Will range about upon the great Ocean,
    _English Brittans_, and _Flemings_ joyned together,
    Shall drive them away as far as _Rouane_.

ANNOT.

By mentioning _Bourdeaux_, _Rouan_, and _Rochel_, the Author
understandeth the whole Naval forces of _France_, which (he saith) shall
be defeated, by the _English_, _Brittains_, and _Hollanders_, and pursued
as far as _Rouane_, which is a Town at the head of the River _Loire_,
from whence it runneth down for the space of 500 Miles to _Nantes_, and a
while after dischargeth it self into the Ocean.


X.

    French.

    De sang & faim plus grand calamité,
    Sept fois sapreste a la Marine plage,
    _Monech_ de faim, lieu pris, captivité,
    Le grand mené, _Croc_, enserré en cage.

    English.

    Of blood and famine, what a great calamity!
    Seven times is ready to come upon the Sea Coast,
    _Monech_ by hunger, the place taken, captivity,
    The great one carried away, _Croc_, shut up in a Cage.

ANNOT.

_Monech_ or _Monaco_ is a Town and Principality belonging to the
Family of the _Grimaldi_ of _Genua_, and is seated by the Sea side,
between _Provence_ and _Genoa_; that place is threatned here with many
afflictions, as is plain in this Stanza.


XI.

    French.

    Les Armées battre au Ciel longue saison,
    L’Arbre au milieu de la Cité tombé,
    Vermine, Rogne, Glaive en face tison,
    Lors le Monarque d’_Adrie_ succombé.

    English.

    Armies shall fight in the Air a great while,
    The tree shall fall in the middle of the City,
    Vermin, Scabs, Sword, fire-brand in the face,
    When the Monarck of _Adria_ shall fall.

ANNOT.

The three first Verses contain several prodigies, that shall happen
before the death of the Duke of _Venice_, or rather (because he is no
Monarck) before the fall of that Monarchy or Common-wealth.


XII.

    French.

    Par la tumeur du _Heb._ _Po._ _Tag._ _Tibre_ de _Rome_,
    Et par lestang _Leman_ & _Aretin_,
    Les deux grands chefs, & Citez de _Garonne_,
    Prins, Morts, Noiez. Partir humain butin.

    English.

    By the swelling of _Heb._ _Po._ _Tag._ _Tiber_ of _Rome_,
    And by the Lake _Leman_ and _Aretin_,
    The two great Heads, and Cities of _Garonne_,
    Taken, Dead, Drowned. The human booty shall be divided.

ANNOT.

_Heb._ is the River _Hebrus_ in _Thracia_, _Po_, is the great River of
_Italy_, _Tag._ is _Tagus_, the River of _Lisbonne_; the rest is plain.


XIII.

    French.

    Par Foudre en Arche Or & Argent fondu,
    De deux Captifs l’un l’autre mangera,
    De la Cité le plus grand estendu,
    Quand submergée la Classe nagera.

    English.

    By Lightning shall gold and silver be melted in the Arch,
    Of two Prisoners one shall eat up the other,
    The greatest of the City shall be laid down,
    When the Navy that was drowned shall swim.

ANNOT.

The words and the sense are plain.


XIV.

    French.

    Par le Rameau du vaillant personage,
    De _France_ infirme, par le Pere infelice,
    Honeurs, Richesses, travail en son viel Age,
    Pour avoir creu le conseil d’homme nice.

    English.

    By the Bow of the valliant men,
    Of weak _France_, by the unfortunate Father,
    Honours, Riches, labour in his old age,
    For having believed the councel of a nice man.

ANNOT.

Every body may understand this as well as I do.


XV.

    French.

    Cœur, vigueur, gloire, le Regne changera,
    De tous points contre, ayant son adversaire,
    Lors _France_ enfance par mort subjuguera,
    Un grand Regent sera lors plus contraire.

    English.

    Heart, vigour, and glory shall change the Kingdom,
    In all points, having an adversary against it,
    Then shall _France_ overcome Childhood by death,
    A great Regent shall then be more adversary to it.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses seem to have foretold of the late Tyrant _Cromwel_.

The two last Verses may be applied to _France_, when the Infant of
_Spain_ _Don Balthazar_ died, _&c._


XVI.

    French.

    Un Prince _Anglois_ _Mars_ a son cœur du Ciel,
    Voudra poursuivre sa fortune prospere,
    Des deux duelles l’un percera le fiel,
    Hay de luy, bien aymé de sa Mere.

    English.

    An _English_ Prince _Mars_ hath his heart from Heaven,
    Will follow his prosperous fortune,
    Of two Duels one shall pierce the gall,
    Being hated of him, and beloved of his Mother.

ANNOT.

By this Stanza is promised to _England_ a Martial Prince, who shall have
his heart from Heaven, and with all endeavours follow his prosperous
fortune, which is a remarkable and commendable part in a man.

By the last two Verses, it seemeth that this Prince shall have a Son, who
shall fight two duels, for one of which his Father shall be angry and
hate him, but his Mother shall love him for it.


XVII.

    French.

    Mont _Aventine_ brusler nuit sera veu,
    Le Ciel obscur tout a un coup en _Flandres_,
    Quand le Monarque chassera son Neveu,
    Lors gens d’Eglise commettront les esclandres.

    English.

    Mount _Aventine_ shall be seen to burn in the night,
    The Heaven shall be darkned upon a sudden in _Flanders_,
    When the Monarch shall expel his Neveu,
    Then Churchmen shall commit scandals.

ANNOT.

Mount-_Aventine_ is one of the seven Mountains in _Rome_. The rest is
plain.


XVIII.

    French.

    Apres la pluye de lait assez longuette,
    En plusieurs lieux de _Rheims_ le Ciel touché,
    O quel conflit de sang pres deux lapreste,
    Pere & Fils Rois, noseront approché.

    English.

    After a pretty long rain of Milk,
    In many places of _Rhemes_ the lightning shall fall,
    O what a bloody fight is making ready near them,
    Father and Son, both Kings, shall not dare to come near.

ANNOT.

_Rhemes_ is a City in _France_. The rest is easie.


XIX.

    French.

    En _Lucques_ sang & lait viendra pleuvoir,
    Un peu devant changement de Preteur,
    Grand Peste & Guerre, Faim & soif sera voir,
    Loin ou mourra leur Prince Recteur.

    English.

    In _Luca_ it shall rain Blood and Milk,
    A little before the change of the Magistrate,
    A great Plague, War, Hunger and Thirst shall be seen,
    A great way off, where their Prince Ruler shall die.

ANNOT.

_Luca_ at present is a strong Town, and a little Common-wealth by it self
in _Italy_, governed by their own Magistrate: That Town is threatned here
to see those prodigies mentioned, a little before the change of their
Government, besides a great Plague and dearth; as also the death of their
chief Magistrate, who shall die far off that Countrey.

As for the _raining Milk and Blood_, they are Prodigies that have
appeared often before, and therefore not incredible, as those that are
Versed in History may justifie: and although the reasons may be drawn
from natural causes, yet would they be too tedious if I should insert
them here.


XX.

    French.

    Par les Contrées du grand flevue _Betique_,
    Loin d’_Ibere_, au Royaume de _Grenade_,
    Croix repoussées par gens Mahometiques,
    Un de _Cordube_ trahira a la fin Contrade.

    English.

    Through the Countreys of the great River _Betis_,
    Far from _Iberia_, in the Kingdom of _Granada_,
    Crosses beaten back by Mahometan people,
    One of _Corduba_ shall at last betray the Countrey.

ANNOT.

The great River, called in Latine _Betis_, and in Spanish _Guadalquivir_,
is the River of _Sevilia_, the most famous Town in _Spain_ for Trade.
This River runneth through most of the _Spanish_ Dominions, and
dischargeth it self into the Ocean about the mouth of the Straights,
over against _Barbary_, upon which Coast of _Spain_ lyeth the Kingdom of
_Granada_, the chief City of which is _Corduba_, in _Spanish Cordua_.
This Kingdom was of time almost immemorial, occupied and inhabited by
the _Moores_, till they were expelled and driven back into _Barbary_, by
_Ferdinand_ and _Isabella_, King and Queen of _Castilia_. The rest is
easie.


XXI.

    French.

    Au _Crustamin_ pres Mer _Adriatique_.
    Apparoistra un horrible poisson,
    De face humaine & de corps aquatique,
    Qui se prendra dehors de l’Hamecon.

    English.

    In the _Crustamin_ near the _Adriatick_ Sea,
    An horrid Fish shall appear,
    Having a mans face, and a fishes body,
    Which shall be taken without a hook.

ANNOT.

I suppose this _Crustamin_ to be some place so called, near the
_Adriatick_ Sea.

As for Fishes with an humane face, we have several examples of them.
_Ambrosius Paræus_ relateth divers, and in his works hath inserted the
Pictures of them.

1. When _Mena_ was Governour of _Ægypt_, and walked by the _Nilus_ side,
he saw a Sea-man rising out of the River, having an humane shape as far
as the Navel, and with a grave look and fair hairs, intermixed with white
ones, bony Breast, and distinct Arms, the rest of the body was like a
Fish. Three days after in the Morning appeared another Sea-monster like a
woman: those two Monsters appeared so long, that every body had time to
consider them.

2. _Rondeletius_ saith, that in our age was taken a Fish in the Sea
of _Norway_, which every body presently called a Monk, because of the
resemblance.

3. In the year 1531. was seen a Sea-monster, covered with Scales, which
for the resemblance was called a Bishop, _Rondeletius_ and _Gesuerus_
have the Picture of it.

4. In the year 1523. was seen in _Rome_ a Fish about the bigness of a
Child of five years old, that had humane shape to the Navel, except the
ears: So that all those things related of _Tritons_, _Nereides_ and
_Sirens_ seem not altogether fabulous, and we may conclude with _Pliny_:
_Vera est vulgi opinio, quicquià nascatur in parte naturæ ulla, & in
Mariesse, præterque multa quæ nusquam alibi_, lib. 9. cap. 2.


XXII.

    French.

    Six jours lassaut devant Cité donné,
    Livrée sera forte & aspre Bataille,
    Trois la rendront, & a eux pardonné,
    Le reste a feu & sang trauche taille.

    English.

    Six days shall the assault be given to the City,
    A great and fierce Battle shall be fought,
    Three shall surrender it and be pardoned,
    The rest shall be put to fire and sword, cut and slasht.

ANNOT.

Some famous City must be here understood, which the Author hath not
named. The same shall be assaulted for six days continually, and in
conclusion shall be surrendred or betrayed by three men, who shall
be pardoned, and all the rest put to Fire and Sword. Most men that
have knowledge in History, interpret this of the City of _Magdebourg_
in _Germany_, that was destroyed with Fire and Sword by the Earl of
_Tilly_, General for the Emperour against _Gustavus Adolphus_, King of
_Swedeland_. For the like devastation and cruelty was never heard of in
_Europe_.


XXIII.

    French.

    Si _France_ passe outre Mer _Liquistique_,
    Tu te verras en Isles & Mers enclos,
    Mahomet contraire plus Mer l’_Adriatique_,
    Chevaux & Asnes tu rongeras les os.

    English.

    If _France_ goeth beyond the _Ligustick_ Sea,
    Thou shall see thy self inclosed with Islands and Seas,
    _Mahomet_, against thee besides the _Adriatick_ Sea,
    Of Horses and Asses thou shalt gnaw the bones.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the miseries which the _French_ were to suffer in the
Island of _Corsica_, till the peace was concluded in the year 1559. The
Author directeth his speech to the _French_ Fleet that went to _Corsica_
in the year 1555.

He saith in the first Verse, _If France goeth beyond the Ligustik Sea_;
that is, if thou goest to _Corsica_, which is beyond the _Ligustik_ Sea
towards _Africa_. _Thou shalt see thy self enclosed with Islands and
Seas_; that is, thou shalt be constrained to keep within those two Towns
which thou hast there, without going out either by Land or Sea; not by
Sea for want of Ships, nor by Land the Garrisons being weak, because the
King had then so much business that he could not suffice all.

Moreover the Author addeth that _Mahomet shall be contrary_; not that
he was an Enemy to _France_, but because he was then Master of the
_Adriatick_ Sea; so that the _Venetians_, which were then friends to the
_French_, could not succour them.

And thus the news of the peace being brought, the _French_ did eat their
Horses and Asses, and there was never a peace so well come as to the
_French_ that were in _Corsica_.


XXIV.

    French.

    De l’Entreprise grande confusion,
    Perte de gens Thresor innumerable,
    Tu ny doibs faire encore tension,
    _France_ a mon dire fais que sois recordable.

    English.

    From the undertaking great confusion,
    Loss of people and innumerable Treasury,
    Thou oughtest not yet to tend that way,
    _France_ endeavour to remember my saying.

ANNOT.

This is annexed and hath relation to the precedent, therefore needeth no
other interpretation.


XXV.

    French.

    Qui au Royaume _Navarrois_ parviendra,
    Quand la _Sicile_ & _Naples_ seront joints,
    _Bigorre_ & _Landes_ par _Foix_ lors on tiendra,
    D’Un qui d’_Espagne_ sera par trop conjoint.

    English.

    He that shall obtain the Kingdom of _Navarre_,
    When _Sicily_ and _Naples_ shall be joyned,
    _Bigorre_ and _Landes_ then by _Foix_ shall beheld
    Of one who shall too much be joyned to _Spain_.

ANNOT.

_Bigorre_ is a Town in _Gascony_, the _Landes_ is a desert Countrey about
_Bourdeaux_ wherein nothing groweth but _Pine-Trees_, _Foix_ is a Country
of _Gascony_, called the County, of _Foix_. The rest is easie.


XXVI.

    French.

    Des Rois & Princes dresseront simulachres,
    Augures, creux eslevez aruspices:
    Corne victime dorée, & d’_Azur_ & de Nacre,
    Intrepretez seront les extispisces.

    English.

    Some Kings and Princes shall set up Idols,
    Divinations and hollow raised Divinators,
    Victim with gilded Horns, and set with _Azur_ and Mother of Pearl
    The looking into the Entrals shall be interpreted.

ANNOT.

I can find nothing in this but a description of the Heathens sacrifices
in ancient times, where they brought the Victim, that is, the beast
that was to be sacrificed, trimmed in a gallant manner, having the
Horns gilded, and set with Azure and Mother of Pearl, and after the
Entrals were taken out, by the inspection of them they practised their
Soothsaying. This inspection of Entrals was called by the Latines
_Extispicium_, from the word _Exta_ which signifieth Entrals, and
_specto_ which signifieth to look.


XXVII.

    French.

    Prince _Libique_ puissant en Occident,
    _Francois_ d’_Arabe_ viendra tant enflammer,
    Scavant aux Lettres sera condescendent
    La Langue _Arabe_ en _Francois_ translater.

    English.

    A _Libian_ Prince being powerful in the West,
    The _French_ shall love so much the _Arabian_ Language,
    That he being a Learned man shall condescend,
    To have the _Arabian_ tongue translated into _French_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is _de Futuro_, and is concerning a _Libian_ Prince
(now _Libia_ is a Kingdom of _Africa_) who shall be a powerful man in
the West, and being a lover of learning shall condescend to have the
_Arabian_ Language translated into _French_, because the _French_ at that
time shall be much in love with it.


XXVIII.

    French.

    De Terre foible & pauvre parentale,
    Par boute & paix parviendra a l’Empire,
    Long temps regner une jeune femelle,
    Qu’oncques en Regne nen survint un si pire.

    English.

    One weak in Lands and of poor Kindred,
    By thrusting, and peace shall attain to the Empire,
    Long time shall Reign a young woman,
    Such as in a Reign was never a worse.

ANNOT.

The words are so plain, that every body may interpret them.


XXIX.

    French.

    Les deux Neveux en divers lieux nourris,
    Navale pugne, Terre peres tombez,
    Viendront si haut eslevez aguerris,
    Venger l’Injure ennemis succombez.

    English.

    The two Nephews brought up in divers places,
    A Sea fight, fathers fallen to the Earth,
    They shall came highly educated, and expert in Arms,
    To avenge the injury, their enemies shall fall down under them.

ANNOT.

This is concerning two _Nephews_, who shall be educated in divers places,
and grow expert in Arms, their Fathers shall be killed, but those
_Nephews_ shall come, and having fought at Sea, shall revenge the injury
done to them, overcoming their enemies.


XXX.

    French.

    Celuy qu’en luitte & fer au fait Bellique,
    Aura porte plus grand que luy le prix,
    De nuit au lit six luy feront la pique,
    Nud sans harnois subit sera surprins.

    English.

    He who in Wrestling and Martial affairs,
    Had carried the prize before his better,
    By night Six shall abuse him in his bed,
    Being naked, and without harness, he shall suddenly be surprised.

ANNOT.

Many attribute this to the Earl of _Montgomery_ in _France_, who having
run a tilt against _Henry_ II. unfortunately killed him, for which, and
for being of the Protestant party, he was afterwards beheaded, though
quarter had been given him.


XXXI.

    French.

    Aux Champs de _Mede_, d’_Arabe_, & d’_Armenie_,
    Deux grands Copies trois fois sassembleront,
    Pres du Rivage d’_Araxes_ la mesgnie,
    Du grand _Soliman_ en Terre tomberont.

    English.

    In the fields of _Media_, _Arabia_, and _Armenia_,
    Two great Armies shall meet thrice,
    Near the Shore of _Araxes_, the people
    Of great _Solyman_ shall fall down.

ANNOT.

This signifieth no more, but the loss of three famous Battles on the
_Turks_ side, against the _Persians_.

The first that I find after the coming out of these Prophesies, is the
Battle of _Sancazan_, seven miles from _Tauris_, and hard by the River
_Araxes_, where 20000 _Turks_ were slain, without any considerable loss
of the _Persians_; this was in the time of _Amurath_ the III. Emperour
of the _Turks_, and son to _Selyman_ the second. The other two Battles
I could not make good, because I want the supplement of the _Turkish_
History, as also because they have not yet happened.


XXXII.

    French.

    Le grand sepulchre du peuple _Aquitanique_,
    S’aprochera aupres de la _Toscane_,
    Quand _Mars_ sera pres du coin _Germanique_,
    Et au terroir de la gent _Mantuane_.

    English.

    The great grave of the _Aquitanick_ people,
    Shall come near _Tuscany_,
    When _Mars_ shall be in the _German_ corner,
    And in the Territory of the _Mantuan_ people.

ANNOT.

The Lord of _Thou_ saith in his History, that the Cardinal _Caraffa_ got
by the King of _France_’s permission, out of _Corsica_, several Troops
of _Gascons_, and brought some with them, to the number of about 2000
which were quartered about _Rome_. Many of them were among the Troops of
the Duke of _Guise_, being allured thither by the reputation of their
Countreyman Captain _Monluc_.

The Author foretelleth, that they shall find their Graves near _Tuscany_,
because the Territory of _Rome_ joyneth to that Province.

Then in the 3 and 4 Verse he specifieth the time by two marks; one is,
_when ~Mars~ shall be near the German corner_; the other, _when he shall
be in the Territory of the Mantuan people_, and the War was then in that
Territory; for the Duke of _Ferrara_ to shew he would not stand still,
sent his son _Alphonso d’Este_ to make incursions there, and to take some
places.

Moreover the War was then near the _German corner_, which is _Lorrain_,
when _Henry_ II. besieged _Thionville_ in the year 1558. _Paradin_
sheweth, that _Mars_ was in the _German corner_ two years before, sith
about the end of the year 1555; the Duke of _Nevers_ by an extraordinary
endeavour in the middle of the Winter, did relieve _Mariembourg_: and
the following years the _French_ Garrisons kept the fields to avoid
surprises. And in the year 1557. when the Duke of _Guise_ fought in
_Italy_, the Duke of _Savoy_ brought his Army against _Mariembourg_; so
it proved true that _Mars_, _viz._ the War was in the _German corner_;
for that Town is in the borders of _Germany_, and was in that corner till
the taking of _Thionville_.


XXXIII.

    French.

    En la Cité ou le loup entrera,
    Bien pres de la les ennemis seront,
    Copie estrange grand pais gastera,
    Aux Monts des _Alpes_ les amis passeront.

    English.

    In the City wherein the Wolf shall go,
    Near that place the enemies shall be,
    An Army of strangers shall spoil a great Countrey,
    The friends shall go over the Mountains of the _Alpes_.

ANNOT.

The two last Verses make me think that this Prophesie was fulfilled in
the time of _Henry_ II. King of _France_, because the _French_ being then
friends to the Pope, went over the _Alpes_ to serve him.

This Stanza might also be applyed to _Lewis_ 13, who caused his Army to
go beyond the _Alpes_, but that word _Friends_ is more convenient to the
time of _Henry_ II. because the _French_ went then over the _Alpes_ in
quality of friends to serve the Pope.

According to this conjecture, the _wolf_ which signifieth the _Spaniard_,
came _anno_ 1556. into many Towns, which the Duke of _Alba_ took, as we
have said in another place, and because among those Towns _Neptune_ was
one of the most considerable, being seated by the Sea side near _Rome_: I
believe that by this word _City_ he meaneth that Town which belonged to
the _Colonese_.

And to say truth, the _French_ were then very near it, to endeavour the
relief of it.

Afterwards came the Duke of _Guise_’s Army, which is named by the Author,
_an Army of strangers_, because the _French_ and _Germans_ are strangers
to _Italy_. _This Army shall spoil a great Countrey_; for in that year it
went through all _Italy_, and where an Army passeth, nothing but ruine
can be expected.


XXXIV.

    French.

    Quand le defaut du Soleil lors sera,
    Sur le plein jour le Monstre sera veu,
    Tout autrement on l’Interpretera,
    Cherté na garde, nul ny aura pourveu.

    English.

    When the Ecclipse of the Sun shall be
    At noon day, the Monster shall be seen,
    It shall be interperted otherways,
    Then for a dearth, because no body hath provided against it.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is, that when the Sun shall be Eclipsed at noon, a
Monster shall be born, which shall presage a dearth, though no body will
believe it, because they were unprovided against it.


XXXV.

    French.

    Du plus profond de l’Occident d’_Europe_,
    De pauvre gens un jeune enfant naistra,
    Qui par sa langue seduira grande troupe,
    Son bruit au Regne d’Orient plus croistra.

    English.

    Out of the deepest part of the West of _Europe_,
    From poor people a young child shall be born,
    Who with his tongue shall seduce many people,
    His fame shall increase in the Eastern Kingdom.

ANNOT.

This needeth no explication.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Ensevely non mort Apoplectique,
    Sera trouvé avoir les mains mangees,
    Quand la Cité damnera l’Heretique,
    Qu’avoit leur Loix ce leur sembloit changees.

    English.

    One buried, not dead, but Apoplectical,
    Shall be found to have eaten up his hands,
    When the City shall blame the heretical man,
    Who as they thought had changed their Laws.

ANNOT.

Many persons (according to Histories being only in a fit of Apoplexy)
have been buried for dead, and being afterwards taken out of the ground,
have been found to have eaten up their hands, as I my self have seen one
digged out of Saint _Bartholomews_ Church-yard, about the time that the
City of _London_ began to be weary of _Cromwels_ devices and Tyranny, yet
I would not here definitively assert, he was the man here pointed at by
the Title and Epithete of Heretical man, unless it were in the point of
government.


XXXVII.

    French.

    Avant l’assault l’Oraison pronouncée,
    _Milan_ prins l’Aigle, par embusche deceus,
    Muraille antique par Canons enfonsée,
    Par feu & sang a mercy peu receus.

    English.

    Before the assault the Prayer shall be said,
    An Eagle shall take a Kite, they shall be deceived by an Embuscado.
    The ancient wall shall be beaten down with Canons,
    By fire and blood, few shall have quarter.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is easie.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    La gent _Gauloise_ & Nation estrange,
    Outre les Monts, morts pris & profligez,
    Au mois contraire & proche de vendange,
    Par les Seigneurs en accord redigez.

    English.

    The _French_ Nation, and another Nation,
    Being over the Mountains, shall die, and be taken,
    In a month contrary to them, and near the vintage,
    By the Lords agreed together.

ANNOT.

Two kind of Nations were led into _Italy_ by the Duke of _Guise_ to
succour the Pope, _viz._ _French_ and _Germans_, meaning by the _Germans_
all those that use the _German_ Tongue, as _Switzers_, &c.

The Author saith, these two Nations were led beyond the Mountains,
because they went beyond the _Apennine Alpes_, to come down into the
Champion Countrey of _Italy_, where some of them died by the Sword,
others by famine and sickness; others lost their liberty, being made
prisoners of War, others were exposed to the inconveniences that attend a
ruined Army. He addeth, that these accidents shall befall them in a Month
near the _Vintage_, that Month is _September_: He calleth it _Contrary_,
because the Grapes being ripe, the starved Souldiers did eat abundance of
them, and so fell into a bloody flux. The _Pope_’s Tenants made use of
this Stratagem to ruine that Army.

The _Spaniard_ had his revenge the year following, for the Duke of
_Guise_ having missed his design, and being stept before _Civitella_,
and incensed that the _Pope_ did not keep his word with him, he resolved
to go back again into _France_, and so the _Pope_ did by the means of
the Common-wealth of _Venice_, and of the Duke of _Florence_, it was
concluded and signed with the 23 of _September_.

This is the Authors meaning in the 4 Verse, that all the misfortune
which befell the _French_, was by reason of that peace; for the _Pope_
disbanded his Troops, consisting most of _French_ and _Switzers_, the
greatest part of whom fell into the hands of their enemies, and of the
Countrey people, others died of sickness. It is true, that the Duke of
_Guise_ brought his own Army back without much loss, but the Author
speaketh here of the _Gascons_ and _Switzers_, that were in the _Pope_’s
service, under the command of Marshal _Strozzy_, _Monluc_, Cardinal
_Caraffa_, and others.

The time of this peace agreeth with the Prophesie, for it was concluded
on the 23 of _September_, which is a Month near the _Vintage_.


XXXIX.

    French.

    Les sept en trois Mois en concorde,
    Pour subjuger les _Alpes Apeninnes_,
    Mais la tempeste & _Ligure_ coüarde,
    Les profligent en subites ruines.

    English.

    The seven shall agree together within three Months,
    To conquer the _Apennine Alpes_,
    But the tempest, and coward _Genoese_,
    Shall sink them into sudden ruines.

ANNOT.

There shall be seven persons, who shall be three Months in making an
agreement to go beyond the _Apennines_, but they shall be hindred by a
tempest, and by the cowardliness of the _Genoeses_.

    The Dice being cast, and the nest spread,

    Crook-back shall be chosen by the Councel,
    A more hideous Monster I never saw upon Earth.
    The flying blow shall put out one of his eyes,
    The Traitor to the King, shall be admited as faithful.

ANNOT.

This needs no explication.

    L’Enfant naistra a deux dents en la gorge,

    Take heed to go over the _Apennine_ Mountains,
    Your Grave is near _Rome_ and _Ancona_,
    The black frisled hair shall dress a Trophy of you.

ANNOT.

The _Tar_, the _Lot_, and the _Garone_, are three Rivers of _Gascony_,
the Inhabitants of which are forewarned not to go over the _Apennine_
Mountains, or else they shall meet with their Graves near _Rome_ and
_Ancona_. This hath relation to the 38 Stanza, and to the interpretation
thereof, therefore _vide_.


XLIV.

    The Lightning shall be so hurtful to a Virgin,
    That she shall be taken from the Earth, and suspended in the Air.

It is a Dog that shall come howling and leaping to his Mistresses
friends; because she was killed and suspended in the Air by the Lightning.


XLV.

    French.

    Les cinq estranges entrez dedans le Temple,

I suppose these _five strangers_ to be _five Commissioners_, for the

killed in a Church, and the ground prophaned by their blood, according to
the _Romish_ opinion.

    English.

    The Heaven foretelleth concerning the City of _Plancus_,
    By famous Clerks, and fixed Stars,
    That the time of her sudden change is near hand,
    Neither because of her goodness, or wickedness.

ANNOT.

The City of _Plancus_ is _Lion_, because he was the Founder of it. That
City is threatned here of a sudden change, caused neither by her goodness
or wickedness, but by a certain position and aspect of the fixed Stars,
which makes it fatal.


XLVII.

ANNOT.

It is hard to know what he meaneth by the great City wherein there is a
Common-wealth, whether it be _Venice_, _Genoa_, _Geneva_, _Luca_, or some

shelter in it, who shall be summoned by a Trumpet to come out, but the
City will not suffer it, for which the said City shall be scaled, and
repent.


LI.

    French.

    _Paris_ conjure un grand meurtre commettre,

    _Blois_ will cause it to come to pass,
    Those of _Orleans_ will set up their head again,

ANNOT.

The Prophecy contained in the two first Verses came to pass in the time
of _Henry_ the III. King of _France_, when the _Parisians_ did rebel
against him, and made Barricadoes in the streets, thinking to have taken
him, who was compelled to run away for his life, and fly to _Chartres_.
This rebellion was raised and fomented by _Henry_ of _Lorraine_ Duke
of _Guise_, whom the King afterwards caused to be murdered, with his
brother the Cardinal of _Lorraine_, at the Convention of the three
Estates kept at _Blois_.

_Orleans_, _Angers_, _Troyes_, _Langres_, are remarkable Cities in
_France_.

_Campania_, and _Apulia_ are two Provinces of the Kingdom of _Naples_.

The last two Verses of the Prophecy came to pass about the years 1630 and
1631. when _Gustavus Adolphus_ King of _Swedeland_, called here the Lion,

    Sept fois changer verrez gens _Britanique_,
    Teints en sang en deux cens nonante an,
    _France_ non point par appuy _Germanique_,
    _Aries_ double son Pope _Bistarnan_.

    English.

    Seven times you shall see the _English_ to change,
    Died in blood, in two hundred ninety year,
    Not _France_, by the _German_ support,
    _Aries_ doubleth his _Bastarnan_ Pole.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses concern _England_; the third _France_; the fourth
marketh the time by the motion of the Sign of _Aries_, which shall be
favourable to _France_.

We shall leave the two first Verses to be interpreted by the _English_
Nation, which is most concerned in it, and come to the last two, which
concern _France_.

The third Verse saith that _France_ shall not change as _England_, by
reason of the help it shall have from _Germany_, which hath been made
good already for these hundred years, notwithstanding the Wars between
_Henry_ II. and the _Spaniard_; the Conspiracy of the Protestant party
against _Francis_ the II. at _Amboise_; the civil Wars under _Charles_
the IX. the League under _Henry_ III. and _Henry_ IV. the Forrain Wars
under _Lewis_ XIII. and _Lewis_ XIV. now Reigning.

The Authors meaning by these words, _but France not_, is, you shall not
see _France_ change seven times in two hundred ninety years, as the
_Brittish_ nation, and then he giveth the reason of it, _by German help_,
that is to say, that _France_ shall have help from _Germany_.

The fourth Verse saith, that during those two hundred ninety years,
_Aries doubleth his Bastarnan Pole_, to understand this, we must suppose
first that the Sign of _Aries_ ruleth over _France_, _Palestine_,
_Bastarnia_, &c.

Secondly, we must learn from _Ptolomy_ and other Geographers, that
_Bastarnia_ containeth the people that are towards _Sarmatia_ or
_Poland_, which were called by the Ancients, the people of _Admone_,
_Sidane_, _Roxolane_, and by others _Peucins_, from the Island _Peuce_,
which is in _Istria_.

Thirdly, we must suppose, that the Sign of _Aries_ hath two Poles, the
first is that of the Æquinoctial Line, and the second, that of the
_Eccliptick_, because the Sign of _Aries_ beginneth just in the Line of
the _Equator_, and afterwards stretcheth towards the North. Now it is so
that the place where its extension endeth in the Eccliptical Line of the
Sun, is called by the Author the _Bastarnan Pole_.

It is a _Pole_ sith in the constellations of Heaven, we call _Poles_,
the two ends or extremities of them, and in the constellations of the
Zodiack, we call the first Pole that which is next to the Equator, and
the second Pole that which stretcheth towards the North, or towards the
South in the Eccliptical Line.

In this sense, the first Pole of the Sign of _Aries_, is that which hath
its first degree in the Equator; the second is, that which stretcheth
towards the North in the Eccliptick, and this last Pole is called
_Bastarnan_, because it is Vertical to _Bastarnia_, as the Astrologers
set down their Climates, Kingdoms, Provinces and Towns under the twelve
Signs.

Fourthly, We must suppose that this word _to double_, may signifie three
things. 1. In Sea-mens tearms; it signifieth to go beyond some place,
as to double the Cape of _bona Speranza_, which is called in _Italian_,
_Tramontare_; that is, to go beyond. 2. It signifieth to do twice the
same thing, as _Jacob_ did double his service for _Rachel_, &c. 3. In
matter of traveling; it signifieth to go twice as far as is requisite.

_To double_, in this place cannot be understood in the first sense;
because the constellations never stretcht out of their compasses, though
the Stars of which they are compounded, have their peculiar motions.

To understand this, we must know that the Stars of the Firmament
have their peculiar motions from West to East, upon the Pole of the
Eccliptick, and that they go that way a matter of one Degree, in the
space of about 100 years, and consequently the Stars do retrograde
every year in the Eccliptick from West to East 52 Seconds. _Ptolomeus_
holdeth this opinion, but other renowned Astrologers give them more:
For my part I am of _Tychobrahe_’s opinion, who allowed them one Degree
of retrogradation in 70 years and 7 Months, and consequently 51 Seconds
every year.

According to this Doctrine the Star that is in the Horn of _Aries_, was
observed by _Tymocharis_ in 2d Degree; 150 years after, _Hipparchus_
observed it in the first; 265 years after, _Ptolomeus_ saw it in the 6
Degree; 740 years after, _Albathognius_ observed it in the 18 Degree; 304
years after, _Alphonsus_ King of _Spain_, found it in the 6 Degree; 265
years after, _Copernicus_ did observe it to be in the 27 Degree and two
Minutes; 61 years after, _Tychobrahe_ saw it in the 27 Degree, and above
37 Minutes; so that in the space of 61 years it had gone 35 Minutes.

By this Doctrine we see that the whole constellations do not go beyond
their Poles, though the Stars that Compound them change their Poles every
year of 51 Seconds.

To double, then here cannot be taken in the first sense, nor in the third
sense, for the first reason, it must then be in the second sense; and
thus _Aries doubleth his Bastarnan Pole_; that is, _Aries_ maketh twice
his Pole, which answereth to _Bastarnia_.

If you ask how it cometh to pass that _Aries_ doubleth this Pole, and
in what place of Heaven we set this _Bastarnan Pole_. I answer to the
first, that _Aries_ doubleth his Pole, when one of those 13 Stars cometh
to that point, which is a Northern or Western Pole to that sign in the
Eccliptick. As to the second: I answer, that the place ought to be its
last Degree, _viz._ the end of the 30 Degree.

Why? (will you say) did the Author mark that difference of the Sign of
_Aries_, rather than that of _Taurus_, or of another?

I answer, that it was in favour of _France_; because _Aries_ doth govern
in _France_, and if it hath been favourable to it, when it came first to
the _Bastarnan Pole_, it will be so too when it doubleth the same Pole,
seeing that it will have the same position and Aspect. Now we see, that
in the space of these 100 years, _France_ was not overcome, much less
shall it be hereafter, seeing that the Stars do promise its exaltation
for a long continuance.

If I were a great Astrologer, I should observe exactly by this, that
within the space of 290 years, _Aries shall double his Cape Bastarnan_,
and consequently _Aries_ should come to that Pole just in the year 1845.
which is according to that we have said.

ANNOT.

The _Cyrenian_ Sea, is that Sea which is by the Province of _Cyrene_. The

    A long rest shall be on the _Jonique_ Port.

ANNOT.

I could not find what he meaneth by _Olchade_. The second Verse is plain.

_Parthia_ and _Media_ are two Kingdoms depending from that of _Persia_.
The Islands of _Cyclades_ are in the _Ægean_ Sea, and are so called
because they are like a Garment about the City of _Delos_, for κυκλας in

    He shall not die of a deserved death, nor by chance,
    But the disease of being tied hand and foot, hath made him prisoner.

ANNOT.

The Bailif of _Orleans_ is a great Officer, for he is there Lord Chief
Justice, and of all the precincts. It seemeth that this man shall be put

    English.

    Great _Britany_ comprehended in _England_,
    Shall suffer so great an Inundation by Waters,
    The new League of _Ausone_ shall make Wars,
    So that they shall stand against them.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is divided in two parts. The first two Verses foretel a
great Innundation, that was to happen in _England_.

The last two speak of a league and insurrection, that shall be at
_Bordeaux_, which is here called _Ausone_, from a famous Latine Poet,
named _Ausonius_, who was born in that City.

As to the first part, after much seeking and enquiry: I found the truth
of it in a Latine book, called _Rerum in Gallia, Belgia, Hispania,
Anglia, &c. gestarum anno 1607. Tomi septimi Liber secundus conscriptus a
~Nicolao Gotardo~ Artus Dantiscano_, where the History is related thus.

About the end of _January_ 1607 the Sea broke out so violently in
_England_, that after the breaking of Fences and Dikes, it caused very
great damages to the Inhabitants. The greatest mischief was done in
_Somersetshire_, where the water did overflow, ten Leagues in length,
and two in breadth, twelve foot high in the most eminent places. This
sudden Innundation brought a fearful alarm to the Countrey people; some
of them going to their Plough, were fained to run back to their houses,
where they found their enemies at their doors, _viz._ Death and Water,
who without distinction swept them away. In a little time, the Towns
appeared like Islands, encompassed on all sides, and presently after
were swallowed up, so that the tops of the Trees were scarce seen. This
new Flood covered so the Towns of _Hansfield_, in the same County, those
of _Grantham_, _Kenhus_, _Kingston_, and _Briandon_, with several Farms
built in the Champion Countrey, that none of the Buildings could be seen.
If you add to this the devastation of the places, the quantity of Corn,
Fruit, and Grass that was lost, the misery shall be so great, as not to
be expressed. During this fearful quarrel between the Water and the Land,
an exceeding great number of people died of all Ages, and Sexes, it would
avail them nothing to get into the upper Stories and Roofs of houses,
nor upon the highest Trees; for the imperious Waters did so swell and
rage, that the Foundations of the houses, and roots of the Trees were
loosened, so that both fell to the Ground, or rather into the Water. The
people seeing no way to escape, resolved to die patiently. No body could
without great grief see the Oxen and Sheep drowning; for there was such a
numerous quantity of them, that afar off one would have thought them to
be Rocks in the Sea, but seeing them swiming, and hearing them bleating
and bellowing, one would have thought them to be a storm and hissing of
winds. A rich Farmer, and father of seven Children, being involved in the
Flood, and much astonished at this accident, nevertheless thinking the
danger less then it was, went about to save some of his best Goods; but
seeing the Waters to increase, he forsook all, and went to save one of
his Children, whom he loved best; but the Waters followed him so close,
that all he could do, was to get upon the Roof of his house. Among the
Children there was a little one sleeping in a Cradle, which being made of
close boards, did swim upon the Waters about three Miles, and was taken
up alive, and sound. The Hay-cocks did swim like Ships upon the Waves,
the Pigeons and Pigs were upon the Sheaves that the Water carried away.
The Coneys being driven out of their holes, had leapt upon the backs of
the swiming Sheep. A certain Shepheard being about to gather his Sheep
into their Fold, was followed by the Flood, ran for his life, and climbed
upon a high Tree, where seeing his Sheep bleating in the water, he began
to tear his hair, to smite his breast, to lift up his hands and his eyes
to Heaven, and when his Sheep had all perished, and himself endured an
extream cold and hunger, he was at last taken up in a Boat that was sent
to save the distressed.

But here we must talk of _Bristol_, which is one of the chiefest Cities
in _England_, by reason of the Haven, which bringeth thither abundance of
Merchants, from several Nations. The same day of that Inundation, the Sea
breaking into a great Channel, did presently overflow the Countrey with
such quickness and violence, that it covered the Valleys, and the smaller
Hills, in so much that nothing but an utter ruine was expected; many
whole houses were turned upside down, and carried away with the Flood.
The Barns full of Corn, Hay, and Straw, were overthrown, and the Cattle
carried away, besides abundance of people of all sorts. The Merchants
of _London_ and _Bristol_, and the rest of the Inhabitants, besides the
loss of Provisions, suffered an inestimable one in their Commodities,
which they had provided for the Fair, that was then near hand, the most
part of them being carryed away by the Flood, and the rest so spoiled,
that the owners could not tell what to do with them. A Gentleman dwelling
between _Barnstable_ and _Bristol_, and two Leagues off from the Sea,
being gone abroad in the Morning to oversee his grounds, did look towards
the Sea, ran back again to his house, to bring this sad news to his Wife
and Servants, while they were endeavouring to pack up the most precious
of their Goods, the Water came about the house so fast, that they altered
their resolution, and bethought themselves only to save their lives;
the servants busied themselves about tying the Goods together, thinking
the Water could not have carryed them away. As for the Gentleman, he
went with his Wife and Children to the top of the house, and got upon
the rafters of the Roof. Although nothing appeared to them but the
Image of death; nevertheless some hope and desire of escaping, made
the Gentleman come down to save a little Trunk, wherein his papers of
greatest concernment were. Being come down from the Rafter, he laid hold
of the Trunk, and fastened it to a Manger; while he was busie about it,
the Waves of the Sea did so beat against that house, that it fell down
to the Ground. The Wife, Children, and Servants were swallowed up in the
ruine. The Gentleman laid hold on a Rafter, and was carryed away with it
above half a League further, to a Mountain, where he set his foot upon
dry Ground, being half dead with fear and grief, and bewailing the loss
of his Wife, Children, and Servants, he spyed the little Trunk and the
Manger, which he drew to Land, and that was all he saved, besides his
Life.

Another Gentleman living thereabouts, and newly married, was resolved
that day to go to the next Town, and make merry with some friends,
whereupon he bid his man make his Horse ready, and himself went to put on
his Boots; after he had put on one, and whilst he held the other in his
hand, the Waters came so fiercely into that house, that they compelled
the half Booted Gentleman to run away for his life, in an upper Chamber,
but he was followed so close by that merciless Element, that he was
fained to get upon the top of the Roof, to save his life, and to ride
upon the upper Rafter, but the house and Roof melting by the violence of
the Waves, this new Knight was carryed by the violence of them towards
the Town where he intended to make merry, and there was saved with much
adoe.

It happened at the same time near _Markand_, in the Dutchy of _Norfolk_,
that two Thieves, going about to steal some Cattle, while they were
driving of them, perceived in the Morning the Justice of God following
them; it was the Water, which having overtopped the Dikes, threatned the
takers of being taken, and compelled them to save themselves with all
speed. From their wickedness did arise a great good; for to the next Town
they went, and bid the Sexton to Ring the Bell, and to cry Water, Water:
The Inhabitants being for the most part asleep, did not know what to do
in such an Alarm: Some climbed into the Church’s Steeple; others thinking
there were Thieves went about to fence and defend their houses; others
hearing of a Flood, laughed at it, and said, that those who brought
this News, deserved to be punished; but presently they altered their
Languages, and their laughing was turned into a fearful mourning, every
one flying to save himself, his Wife, and Children, and whatsoever they
could pack up of their most precious Goods. Some thinking to have more
wit than others, went about to divert the Current of the Water from their
houses; but seeing there was no remedy, they went with their Wives and
Children to the tops of their houses, in a lamentable fright.

But when the Water came to seize upon the houses, wherein there were some
Playing, some Drinking, others already Drunken, a great part of them were
drowned, others ran to a Hill near the Town, where they spent the rest of
that night, and the day following with great lamentations.

The next day they saw their houses half under Water, and many people,
who from the windows and Steeples cryed for help; others endeavoured to
save themselves upon Boards and Rafters; the Horses tyed to the Manger
were all suffocated. The Cattle in the fields, were by this time driven
to the Mount called _Truhill_, and for all that, were not out of danger;
for the Mountain was encompassed with Water to such a heighth and depth,
that without Boats there was no access to it; chiefly because of the
Thickets and Bushes. Thus so much Cattle was about to perish, had not
some Shepherds brought Boats loaded with provisions for Men and Beasts,
till the Waters retired again, and the Dikes were made good.

in fear, so that they shall come to an agreement, which the true Tithes
shall be paid, and every one come to his own again.

    Le tiers climat soubs _Aries_ comprins,

    English.

    The third Climat comprehended under _Aries_,
    In the year 1700. the twenty seven of _October_,
    The King of _Persia_ shall be taken by those of _Ægypt_,
    Battle, death, loss, a great shame to the Christians.

ANNOT.

Here be three notable things to be observed: one is the plain and
punctual specification of the time, in which the Prophecy shall come to
pass, _viz._ the 7. of _October_ in the year 1700. The second is, that
the King of _Persia_ shall be taken by those of _Ægypt_. The third is,
the shame and confusion that the Christians shall suffer for the same.

    Le Chef d’_Escosse_ avec six d’_Allemagne_,

    English.

    The Chief of _Scotland_ with six of _Germany_,
    Shall be taken prisoners by Seamen of the East,
    They shall go through the _Calpre_ and _Spain_,
    And shall be made a present in _Persia_ to the new fearful King.

ANNOT.

By the _Calpre_ is understood the _Capzor_ promontory, which is at the
mouth of the _Streights_, by and beyond which these Prisoners will be
carried into _Persia_ for a present to the King, who then shall be some
fearful person.

    Le grand criard sans honte audacieux,

    English.

    The great bawler proud without shame,
    Shall be elected Governour of the Army,
    The stoutness of his Competitor,
    The Bridge being broken, the City shall faint for fear.

ANNOT.

_Paradin_ saith, that in the year 1558. the Lord of _Bonnivet_ being
dead, the King of _France_ did chuse _Francis_ of _Vendosme_, _Vidame_ of
_Amiens_, to succeed the said _Bonnivet_, in the Office of Colonel of the
_French_ Foot. This _Vidame_ is noted by all Historians, for a rash proud
man, that had a good opinion of himself, and found fault with all the
commands of the Marshal of _Brissac_, then General of the Army.

The King in consideration of his Birth, and that he was a good Souldier,
gave him the place of the Lord _Bonnivet_, according to what the Author
saith, _The great Bawler, ~&c.~ shall be elected Governour in the Army_.
If you ask in what Army he was elected Governour, the third Verse
answereth, _in the Army of his Competitor_, that is, the Marshal of
_Brissac_, who did chide him severely for disobeying his commands, and
was like once to have killed him.

The fourth Verse proved true at the taking of _Queiras_, where the
Bridge, through which the succours came to relieve the Town, being
broken, the Town grew so fearful, that it surrendred it self to the
Marshal of _Brissac_.

    English.

    _Erins_, _Antibe_, and the Towns about _Nices_,
    Shall be destroyed by Sea and Land,
    The Grashopers shall have the Land, the Sea, and Wind favourable,
    They shall be taken, killed, thrust up, plundered, without Law of War.

ANNOT.

_Erins_ and _Antibe_ are Towns of _Provence_, bordering upon _Nice_,
which is a Town of _Piemont_, all that Coast is threatned here to be
ruined by the Grashopers, that is, the _Turks_, which fell out about the
year 1558. for the King of _France_ having called the _Turks_ to his
succours against _Charles_ V. Emperour, they came and took _Nice_ in the
behalf of the _French_, where they committed unheard cruelties, as also
upon all that Coast.

    The fatal and eternal order by chain,
    Shall come to turn by consequent order,
    Of Port _Phocen_ the chain shall be broken,
    The City taken, and the enemy presently after

ANNOT.

This Prophecy regardeth onely the City of _Marseilles_, which is the most
famous Port Town that the _French_ have upon the _Mediterranean_ Sea,
and which was anciently a _Greek_ Colony, peopled by the _Phocen_ Seas.
This City is threatned here to have the chain of her Port broken, and to
be taken by her enemies, and the said enemies to be a little while after
taken in it.

    English.

    From the _English_ Kingdom the worthy driven away,
    The Councellor through anger shall be burnt,
    His partners shall creep so low,
    That the bastard shall be half received.

ANNOT.

This is one of those Prophecies that concern the _English_ Nation, and
which by its event, hath made this Book and the Author thereof famous,
for nothing can be more plain to the meanest capacity, then the sense and
words of these four Verses.

By the first, is meant the Kings most excellent Majesty _Charles_ II.
now Reigning, who being the true Heir to the Kingdom, and most worthy to
rule, was driven out of the Kingdom by a rebellious rout of his Subjects.

The second Verse expresseth, the punishment inflicted upon the
Councellors and Abettors of so hainous a crime, who were most of them
hanged, drawn and quartered, their entrals burnt.

The third Verse, signifieth the low estate of the Abettors of that
pernicious Councel.

The fourth Verse, is understood that bastard Faction, which was like to
supplant _Cromwel_, upon the division of the Army.

    The long hairs of the _Celtian France_,
    Joyned with forrain Nations,
    Shall put in prison the _Aquitanick_ Agent,
    To make him yield to their intentions.

ANNOT.

The _Celtan France_ is that part of _France_ included between the River
_Loire_, and that of _Scheld_ in _Flanders_. they are called here the
_long hairs_; because in antient time they used to wear long hairs.

    English.

    The great City shall be made very desolate.
    Not one of the Inhabitants shall be left in it,
    Wall, Sex, Church, and Virgin ravished,
    By Sword, Fire, Plague, Canon, people shall die.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the Town of St. _Quentin_, which was taken by the
_Spaniards_ in the year 1557. upon the 27 of _August_, and 17 days after
the Battle of St. _Laurence_, it was taken by assault, and all the
Inhabitants put to the Sword.

    Par le moyen d’Un bean jeune attrapé,

    English.

    The City shall be taken by cheat and deceit,
    By the means of a fair young one caught in it,
    Assault shall be given, _Raubine_ near _Laude_,
    He, and all shall die, for having deceived.

ANNOT.

It is a City that shall be taken by the cheat and deceit of a young fair
man, who himself shall be taken in his craft.

The difficulty lyeth in the third Verse, _viz._ what he meaneth by
_Raubine_ and _Laude_. I could find nothing by transposition of Letters:
therefore I suppose the Author had a mind to reserve the exposition to
himself, and to one that should be clearer sighted than I.

    English.

    A chief man of _Ausone_ shall go into _Spain_
    By Sea, he shall stay at _Marseilles_,
    He shall languish a great while before his death,
    After his death great wonders shall be seen.

ANNOT.

Here is nothing obscure but the word _Ausone_, by which is meant the City
of _Bordeaux_, so named by the Author every where, for having brought
forth that famous Latine Poet, and Counsul of _Rome_, _Ausonius_.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    Classe _Gauloise_ naproche de _Corsegne_,

    English.

    _French_ Fleet do not come near unto _Corsica_,
    Much less to _Sardinia_, thou shalt repent of it,
    All of you shall die frustrate of the help _Greigne_,
    Blood shall swim, being Captive thou shalt not believe me.

ANNOT.

The Baron of _la Garde_ coming from _Rome_, where he had carryed
the Cardinals of _Tournon_ and _Lorrain_, received order to go into
_Corsica_, to relieve with ammunition the two Towns, that the _French_
kept still in possession in that Island, _Glasse_ and St. _Boniface_,
which after the general peace made at _Cambray_, _anno_ 1559. were
restored to the Common-wealth of _Genoa_. When he was coming near the
Island, there arose such a storm, that they were constrained to go as
near land as they could, _viz._ in St. _Florents_, till the storm was
over.

At the same time, by reason of the said storm, eleven Ships loaded with
six thousand _Spaniards_, going for _Italy_, took shelter in the same
place, a good way off from the said Baron.

At the first, the _Spanish_ Ships did not spie the _French_ Galleys, but
the Baron _de la Garde_ discovered the _Spaniards_, and bid his Galleys
to set upon them. Two of the _Spanish_ Ships were taken, in which were
1200. or 1500. _Spaniards_, part of which were drowned, and the rest made
slaves.

The Baron chased the rest, but the storm so scattered them, that the nine
escaped.

Before this encounter the _Genoese_ Captain, _Andrew d’Oria_, took all
the Island from the _French_, _Anno_ 1553. and kept it ever since, by
sending continual supplies. On the other side, the King of _France_ sent
supplies by the Lord of _Termes_, to those that were retired in the
Island of _Glasse_.

One time among the rest, about the latter end of the year 1555. there was
sent a notable supplie from the _French_, to which the Author speaketh
now in these tearms.

_French fleet do not come near unto ~Corsica~_, nor _Sardinia_, which is
another Island near _Corsica_. The third Verse giveth the Reason of it;
_ye shall die, being frustrated of the help ~Greigne~_. _Greigne_ is the
Provencal Language, which was the Maternal one of our Author, signifieth
a Galley: The sense therefore is this, you shall be frustrate of the help
of the Galleys, that are under the command of the Baron _de la Garde_,
who carryed unto you men, money, and ammunition; because he shall be then
in pursute of the _Spanish_ fleet, that were scattered by a storm.

In the mean time _Blood shall swim_ in the fight of the Baron _de la
Garde_, and thou, _poor Prisoner_ in that Island, _Thou shalt not believe
me_; those slaves were they, which went in the year 1555. And the Author
saying, _Thou shalt not believe me_, sheweth, that being very famous in
_Provence_, for his Prophecies, the General of the Army had asked him
concerning the success of his Journey, and that he did warn him not to
undertake it; but having an express command from the King, his Master, he
would need go. Therefore he saith, _Poor prisoner thou shalt not believe
me_. We find in this work many examples of those, who went to consult
with the Author concerning the success of their undertakings, as did
the Earl of _Sommerive_, before the besieging of _Bagnole_, to whom he
answered, that he should leave the Trees loaded with a new kind of fruit,
that is to say, of the Rebels, whom he caused to be hanged on Trees.

    De _Barcelone_ par Mer si grande Armée,
    Toute _Marseille_ de frayeur tremblera,
    Isles saisies, de Mer aide fermeé,

    English.

    There shall come from _Barcelona_ by Sea so great a fleet,
    That _Marseilles_ shall quake for fear,
    The Islands shall be seized, the help by Sea shut up,
    Thy Traitor shall swim to Land.

ANNOT.

_Barcelona_ is a Town in _Spain_, upon the _Mediterranean_ Sea;
_Marseilles_ is another in _France_, upon the same Sea. The rest is
easie.

    English.

    At that time _Cyprus_ shall be frustrated
    Of its succours, of those of the _Ægean_ Sea,
    Old ones shall be killed, but by _Mesles_ and _Lipre_,
    Their King shall be seducted, and the Queen more wronged.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are plain, the two last have need of an _Oedipus_.

    Le grand _Satyre_ & _Tygre_ d’_Hircanie_,
    Don presenté a ceux de l’Occean,

    English.

    The great _Satyr_ and _Tyger_ of _Hircania_,
    Shall be a gift presented to those of the Ocean,
    An Admiral of a fleet shall come out of _Carmania_,
    Who shall Land in the _Thyrren Phocean_.

ANNOT.

_By the great Satyr and Tyger of Hircania_, is meant, the King of
_Persia_, who is also King of _Hircania_, abounding with _Tygers_.

That King of _Persia_ shall be made a gift to those of the Ocean; that
is, shall be either drowned in it, or do some wonderful things upon it.

_Carmania_ is a Province in _Asia_, belonging to the _Turk_.

The _Thyrren Phocean_ is the City of _Marseilles_ in _France_, so called
by the Author in this Book; because it was a Colony of the _Phocenses_
in _Greece_; it is also called _Thyrren_, because it is seated upon the
_Tyrrhenean_ Sea, as _Virgil_ saith,

    ————_Thyrrenum navigat Æquor_.

    L’Arbre qu’estoit par long temps mort seiché,
    Dans une nuit viendra a reverdir,
    Son Roy malade, Prince pied attaché,

    English.

    The Tree that had been long dead and withered,
    In one night shall grow green again,
    His King shall be sick, his Prince shall have his foot tied,
    Being feared by his enemies, he shall make his Sails to rebound.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are Metaphorical, and are to be understood of a
considerable person, who having been for a long time despised and under a
cloud, shall on a sudden rise again and be in repute. The two last Verses
are intelligible enough.


XCII.

    French.

    Le monde proche du dernier periode,
    _Saturn_ encor sera tard de retour,
    Translat Empire devers Nations brode,
    L’œil arraché a _Narbon_ par Autour.

    English.

    The world being near its last period,
    _Saturn_ shall come yet late to his return,
    The Empire shall be translated into _brode_ Nations,
    _Narbon_ shall have her eye pickt out by a Hawk.

ANNOT.

The meaning of the first and second Verses is, that the world shall be at
an end, before _Saturn_ hath performed his whole course, which (if I do
not mistake) is thought by the Astronomers to be of 36000. years.

The third Verse signifieth, that before the end of the world, the Empire
shall be translated or possessed by a black Nation, for _brode_ in old
_French_ signifieth black, whence it cometh that to this day they call a
handsom black woman, _une belle Brode_, that is a fair black woman.

_Narbon_ is a famous City in _Languedoc_, and the seat of an Archbishop.

    English.

    In _Avignon_ all the Chief of the Empire,
    Shall stay, by reason of _Paris_ being desolate,
    _Tricast_ shall stop the _Annibalik_ anger,
    _Lion_ by change shall be ill comforted.

ANNOT.

The first and second Verse signifie, that the Pope once more shall keep
his seat in _Avignon_, which is a Town in _France_ belonging to the
Pope, and where formerly they kept their See, for the space of above an
hundred years. As for the word _Tricast_, there must be a foul errour
in the impression or else; I must confess I understand it not. By the
_Annibilik_ anger, is meant those of _Barbary_, where _Annibal_ was born.
_Lion_ is a famous Town in _France_, where is kept the greatest trading
for Bills of Exchange.


XCIV.

    French.

    De cinq cens ans plus compte l’on tiendra,

    English.

    For five hundred years no account shall be made,
    Of him who was the ornament of his time:
    Then on a sudden he shall give so great a light,

    We shall see the _Morish_ Law to decline,
    After which, another more seducing shall arise,
    _Boristhenes_ shall be the first that shall fall,
    By gifts and tongue that Law shall be most seducing.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth the declining of the _Mahometan_ Religion, after which
another Religion shall be set up worse then the _Mahometan_. The first
decay of it shall begin in _Scythia_, a Kingdom belonging to the King of
_Persia_, through which runneth the River _Boristhenes_.

    English.

    The Chief of _Fossan_ shall have his throat cut,
    By the Leader of the Hunt and Greyhond,
    The fact committed by those of the _Tarpeian_ Mountain,
    _Saturn_ being in _Leo_ the 13. of _February_.

ANNOT.

_Fossan_ is a City in _Piemont_, belonging to the Duke of _Savoy_, the
Chief man or Governour of which is threatned here to have his throat cut
by some Souldiers, either of _Rome_, or belonging to _Rome_, signified
here by the _Tarpeian_ Mountain, upon which the Capitol was built, and
this fact to be committed by one that shall be a famous Huntsman; upon
the 13 of _February_, _Saturn_ being then in the Sign of _Leo_.

    A new Law shall occupy a new Countrey,
    Towards _Syria_, _Judea_ and _Palestina_,
    The great _Barbarian_ Empire shall fall down,
    Before _Phœbe_ maketh an end of her course.

    Two Royal Brothers shall War so much one against the other,

    Of the Mountain _Lebron_ near the _Durance_,
    Armies on both sides, the fight shall be so sharp,
    That _Mesopotamia_ shall be wanting in _France_.

ANNOT.

_Alain_ and _Varnaigre_ are two small Towns in _France_, seated by the
Mountain _Lebron_, near the River called _Durance_, where the Author
saith there shall be such a sharp fight, that _Mesopotamia_ shall be
wanting in _France_, to understand this you must know, that _Mesopotamia_
is a Countrey between two Rivers from the Greek words μεσος, which
signifieth middle, and ποταμὸς which signifieth a River, the meaning then
of the Author is, that the Battle so sharp, the ground shall be wanting
to bury the dead.

    Shall be Conqueror of the man that was his Enemy,
    Strength and terrour shall in a moment be tried,
    When the envious shall be killed with an Arrow.

_CENTURY_ IV.


I.

    French.

    Sera du reste de sang non espandu,
    _Venice_ quiert secours estre donné,
    Apres avoir bien lon temps attendu,
    Cité livrée au premier Cor sonné.

    English.

    There shall be a remnant of blood unspilt,
    _Venice_ shall seek for succours,
    After having long waited for it,
    The City shall be surrendred at the first sound of the Trumpet.

ANNOT.

This to my judgement is concerning the Siege of _Candia_, in which the
_Venetians_ for the space of about twenty years desired and expected
succours from the Christian Princes, which came so slowly, that the City
was fained to surrender upon honorable terms, which is the meaning of the
first Verse, _There shall be a remnant of blood unspilt_.


II.

    French.

    Par mort la _France_ prendra voiage a faire,
    Classe par Mer, marcher Monts _Pyrenées_,
    _Espagne_ en trouble marcher gent militaire,
    Des plus grands Dames en _France_ emmenées.

    English.

    By reason of a death, _France_ shall undertake a Journey,
    They shall have a Fleet at Sea, and march towards the _Pyrenes_,
    _Spain_ shall be in trouble by an Army,
    Some of the greatest Ladies in _France_ carried away

ANNOT.

The whole sense of this is, that by reason of some bodies death, _France_
shall make war against _Spain_ by Sea and Land, and put _Spain_ in great
trouble.

The fourth Verse saith, that some of the greatest Ladies in _France_
shall be carried away, but the question is, whether by the _Spaniards_,
or (which is more probable) by their own Husbands going to war against
_Spain_.


III.

    French.

    D’_Arras_ & _Bourges_ de Brodes grands enseignes,
    Un plus grand nombre de _Gascons_ battre a pied,
    Ceux long du _Rhosne_ saigneront les _Espagnes_,

    English.

    From _Arras_ and _Bourges_ many colours of black men shall come,
    A greater number of _Gascons_ shall go on foot,
    Those along the _Rhosne_ shall let _Spain_ blood,
    Near the Mountain where _Saguntus_ is seated.

ANNOT.

_Arras_ and _Bourges_ are Cities of _France_. As for _brodes_, we have
said before that it signifie brown men, such as are the _Gascoins_,
inhabiting the Province of _Aquitania_ near _Spain_.

_Saguntus_ is a City in _Spain_, that was destroyed by the _Romans_.


IV.

    French.

    L’Important Prince fasché, plaint & querelle,
    De rapts & pillé par Coqs & par Libiques,

    English.

    The considerable Prince vexed, complaineth and quarelleth,
    Concerning rapes and plunderings done by the Cocks and Libiques
    Great trouble by Land, by Sea infinite Sails,
    _Italy_ alone shall drive away the _French_.

ANNOT.

This considerable Prince was _Philip_ the II. King of _Spain_, who was
vexed to see the Cocks, that is the _French_, and Libiques that is the
_Turks_ joyned together, under _Barbarossa_ to commit so many Rapes and
violences upon his Subjects.


V.

    French.

    Croix Paix, soubs un accomply Divin Verbe,
    L’_Espagne_ & _Gaules_ seront unis ensemble,
    Grand clade proche & combat tresacerbe,
    Cœur si hardy ne sera qui ne tremble.

    English.

    The Cross shall have peace, under an accomplished Divine Word,
    _Spain_ and _France_ shall be united together,
    A great Battle near hand, and a most sharp fight,
    No heart so stout but shall tremble.

ANNOT.

We have said before that by _Divine Word_, we must not understand the
second person of the Trinity, but a Divine or Theologian, called in Greek
θεόλογος, which also signifieth _Divine Word_. Therefore the meaning of
the first Verse is, that under the Goverment of some eminent Divine, (be
like a good Pope) the Cross shall have peace, that is, the Christian
Religion shall be in Peace, and persecution shall cease. The last three
Verses are plain.


VI.

    French.

    D’Habits nouveaux apres faite la treuve,
    Malice, trame, & machination,
    Premier mourra qui en fera la preuve,
    Couleur _Venise_, insidiation.

    English.

    After the new Cloaths shall be found out,
    There shall be malice, plotting and machination,
    He shall die the first that shall make trial of it,
    Under colour of _Venice_, shall be a conspiracy.

ANNOT.

Everybody may be as wise as I in the interpretation of this.


VII.

    French.

    Le fils mineur du grand & hay Prince,
    De Lepre aura a vingt ans grande tache,
    De dueil mourra triste & mince,
    Et il mourra la ou tombe chair lache.

    English.

    The younger Son of the great and hated Prince,
    Being twenty years, old shall have a great touch of Leprosie,
    His mother shall die for grief, very sad and lean,
    And he shall die of the disease loose flesh.

ANNOT.

This is easie to be understood, if we remember that _Charles_ IX. King
of _France_, younger son to _Henry_ II. died of a foul disease, and his
Mother _Catharine_ of _Medicis_ died of grief.


VIII.

    French.

    La grand Cité dassaut prompt repentin
    Surpris de nuit, gardes interrompus,
    Les Excubies & veilles Saint _Quentin_,
    Trucidez gardes, & les Portails rompus.

    English.

    The great City shall be taken by a sudden assault,
    Being surprised by night, the Watch being beaten,
    The Court of Guard and Watch of Saint _Quentin_
    Shall be killed, and the Gates broken.

ANNOT.

This great City was the City of St. _Quentin_ in _Picardy_, taken by
assault by _Philip_ the II. _Anno_ 1557.


IX.

    French.

    Le Chef du Camp au milieu de la presse,
    D’un coup de flesche sera blessé aux cuisses,
    Lors que _Geneve_ en larmes & destresse,
    Sera trahie par _Lozanne_ & _Souisses_.

    English.

    The Chief of the Camp in the middle of the crowd,
    Shall be wounded with an Arrow through both his thighs,
    When _Geneva_ being in tears and distress,
    Shall be betrayed by _Lozane_ and the _Switzers_.

ANNOT.

The words and sense are plain.


X.

    French.

    Le jeune Prince accusé faucement,
    Mettra le camp en trouble & en querelles,
    Meurtry le chef par le souslevement,
    Sceptre appaiser, puis guerir escroüelles.

    English.

    The young Prince being falsely accused,
    Shall put the Camp in trouble, and in quarrele,
    The chief shall be murdered by the tumult,
    The Scepter shall be appeased, and after cure the Kings-evil.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie must needs be concerning _England_ or _France_; for there
is but those two Kings that challenge the cure of the Kings-evil.


XI.

    French.

    Celuy quaura couvert de la grand Cappe,
    Sera induit a quelque cas patrer,
    Les douze rouges viendront soüiller la nappe,
    Soubs meurtre, meurtre se viendra perpetrer.

    English.

    He that shall be covered with a great Cloak,
    Shall be induced to commit some great fact,
    The twelve red ones shall Soil the Table-cloth,
    Under murder, murder shall be committed.

ANNOT.

Every one may interpret this as well as I, provided that by the _twelve
red ones_, he understandeth twelve Cardinals.


XII.

    French.

    Le Camp plus grand de route mis ensuite,
    Gueres plus outre ne sera pourchassé,
    Ost recampé & legion reduite,
    Puis hors, des _Gaules_ du tout sera chassé.

    English.

    The greatest Camp being in disorder, shall be routed,
    And shall be pursued not much after,
    The Army shall incamp again, and the Troops set in order,
    Then afterwards, they shall be wholly driven out of _France_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is concerning an out-landish Army that shall invade
_France_, and though numerous, yet shall be put to flight, and shall not
be much pursued: therefore it shall incamp again, and collect and gather
again its Troops, and afterwards shall be wholly driven out of _France_.

I am much mistaken if this Prophecie came not to pass, when the Duke of
_Parma_ at the head of a _Spanish_ numerous Army came into _France_ in
favour of the League; for _Henry_ IV. met him at the siege of _Roven_,
beat him off, and suffered him to retire quietly, and as the common
saying is, made him a Golden Bridge, to retreat into the Low-Countries
again.


XIII.

    French.

    De plus grand perte nouvelles rapportées,
    Le rapport fait le camp festonnera,
    Bandes unies encontre revoltées,
    Double _Phalange_, grand abandonnera.

    English.

    News being brought of a great loss,
    The report divulged, the Camp shall be astonished,
    Troops being united and revolted,
    The double _Phalange_ shall forsake the great one.

ANNOT.

This hath a connexion with the precedent; for while the Prince of
_Parma_ was busied in _France_, news was brought to his Camp, that the
_Hollanders_ had taken _Antwerp_, which discouraged his whole Host, and
made him retire with all speed.

The Word _Phalange_ signifieth a Battailion or part of an Army, which
being expressed here by the word _double Phalange_, signifieth, that both
Horse and Foot deserted the Duke of _Parma_ upon the hearing of this news.


XIV.

    French.

    La mort subite du premier personage,
    Aura changé & mis un autre au Regne,
    Tost, tard venu a si haut & basage,
    Que Terre & mer faudra que lon le craigne.

    English.

    The sudden death of the chief man,
    Shall cause a change, and put another in the Raign,
    Soon, late come to so high a degree, in a low age,
    So that by Land and Sea he must be feared.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are plain.

The two last signifie, that a youth shall come to the Kingdom, _soon_,
that is, by reason of the sudden death of the _chief man_, and _late_;
because being but young, he shall Reign so long, that he shall be famous,
and feared by Sea and Land.


XV.

    French.

    D’ou pensera faire venir famine,
    De la viendra le rassasiement,
    L’œil de la Mer par avare canine,
    Pour de l’un lautre donra Huile, Froment.

    English.

    Whence one thought to make famine to come,
    Thence shall come the fulness,
    The eye of the Sea through a doggish covetousness,
    Shall give to both Oyl and Wheat.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie was fulfilled at the famous Siege of _Ostend_, which
lasted three years and three Months; for the _Hollanders_ that brought
relief to the Town, did for covetousness sell the ammunition to the
_Spaniards_ that besieged it, for which complaint being made by the
States to the Prince of _Orenge_, _Maurice_ of _Nassaw_, as also that they
did the like to _Newport_, which he had besieged; he replyed smartly, do
you not know that your Countrey men would Sail into Hell, were it not for
fear to have their Sails burnt.


XVI.

    French.

    La Cité franche de liberté fait serue,
    Des profligés & resueurs fait azyle,
    Le Roy changé a eux non si proterue,
    De cent seront devenus plus de Mille.

    English.

    The free City from a free one shall become slave,
    And of the banished and dreamers shall be a retreat,
    The King changed in mind, shall not be so froward to them.
    Of one hundred they shall become more than a thousand.

ANNOT.

Here you must observe that the Author being a Papist, speaketh this
concerning the City of _Geneva_, which he saith from a free City became a
slave, when it shook off the Duke of _Savoy_’s domination, and became a
retreat to the Protestants, whom he called the _banished_ and _dreamers_.

In the third Verse, by _the King changed in his mind that shall not be
so froward to them_, he meaneth, _Henry_ IV. who having changed the
Protestant Religion, to be a _Roman_ Catholick, did undertake their
protection against the Duke of _Savoy_ their Prince.

Hence followeth the explication of the fourth Verse, when he saith, that
_of one hundred they shall become more than a thousand_; for in few
years the Protestants became so numerous, that they drove the _Roman_
Catholicks wholly out of the Town, and so have remained to this day
Masters of it.


XVII.

    French.

    Changer a _Beaune_, _Nuis_, _Chalons_, & _Dijon_,
    Le Duc voulant amender la barrée,
    Marchant pres Fleuve, Poisson, bec de plongeon,
    Verra la queüe: Porte sera serrée.

    English.

    There shall be a change at _Beaune_, _Nuis_, _Chalons_, _Dijon_,
    The Duke going about to raise Taxes,
    The Merchant near the River shall see the tail
    Of a Fish, having the Bill of a Cormorant: the door shall be shut.

ANNOT.

_Beaune_, _Chalons_, and _Dijon_, are Cities in _France_, _Nuis_ is a
Town in _Germany_ near the _Rhyne_, three or four Leagues below _Colen_.

For the rest, every one may make his own interpretation, for it is hard
to guess who this Duke should be, or that Fish either, that shall have a
Cormorants Bill after whom the door shall be shut.


XVIII.

    French.

    Les plus Lettrez dessus les faits Cœlestes,
    Seront par Princes ignorans reprouvez,
    Punis d’Edict, chassez comme scelestes,
    Et mis a mort la ou seront trouvez.

    English.

    The most Learned in the Celestial sciences,
    Shall be found fault with, by ignorant Princes.
    Punished by proclamation, chased away as wicked,
    And put to death where they shall be found.

ANNOT.

This is plain, and signifieth no more then a persecution against the
Professors of Heavenly sciences, such as are Astrologers, Astronomers,
_&c._


XIX.

    French.

    Devant _Rouan_ d’_Insubres_ mis le Siege,
    Par Terre & Mer enfermez les passages,
    D’_Hainaut_, de _Flandres_ de _Gand_ & ceux de _Liege_,
    Par leurs levées raviront les Rivages.

    English.

    Before _Rouan_ a Siege shall be laid by the _Insubrians_.
    By Sea and Land the passages shall be shut up,
    Those of _Hainaut_, _Flanders_, _Ghent_, and _Liege_,
    With their Troops shall plunder the Sea-shore.

ANNOT.

This is still concerning the Duke of _Parma_’s Army, when he came into
_France_ against _Henry_ the IV. in favour of the League, for his Army
wherewith he Besieged _Rouen_, was compounded of all those Nations; the
greatest part of which were _Italians_, called here _Insubrians_, from
the Latin word _Insubria_, which signifieth the Countreys of _Savoy_ and
_Piemont_.


XX.

    French.

    Paix uberté long temps on ne loüera,
    Part tout son Regne desert la fleur de Lis,
    Corps mort d’Eau, Terre on apportera,
    Sperants vain heur d’estre la ensevelis.

    English.

    Peace and plenty shall not be long praised,
    All the time of his Reign the Flower de Luce shall be deserted,
    Bodies shall die by water, Earth shall be brought,
    Hoping vainly to be there Buried.

ANNOT.

This only foretelleth a great Famine and Inundation in _France_,
signified here by the _Flower de Luce_.


XXI.

    French.

    Le changement sera fort difficile,
    Cité Province au change gain fera,
    Cœur haut, prudent mis, chassé l’Inhabile,
    Mer, Terre, Peuple, son estat changera.

    English.

    The change shall be very hard,
    The City and Countrey shall gain by the change,
    A high prudent heart shall be put in, the unworthy expelled,
    Sea, Land, People shall change its condition.

ANNOT.

This needeth no Interpretation.


XXII.

    French.

    La grand Copie qui sera dechassée,
    Dans un moment fera besoing au Roy,
    La Foy promise de loing sera faucée,
    Nud se verra en piteux defarroy.

    English.

    The great Army that shall be rejected,
    In a moment shall be wanted by the King.
    The faith promised a far off shall be broken,
    So that he shall be left naked in a pitiful case.

ANNOT.

This is plain.


XXIII.

    French.

    La Legion dans la Marine classe,
    _Calcine Magnes_, Souphre & Poix bruslera,
    Le long repos de l’asseurée place,
    _Port Selin_ chercher, feu les consumera.

    English.

    The Legion in the Maritine Fleet,
    _Calcineth Magnes_, shall burn Brimstone and Pitch,
    The long rest of the secure place,
    They shall seek _Port Selyn_, but fire shall consume them.

ANNOT.

Here we must observe four things, the first is, that _Calais_ is called
by the Author, _The long rest of the secure place_. Because then _viz._
in the year 1555. it was yet in the power of the King of _England_, and
had been quietly before, for the space of 287. years, that is, from the
year 1347. till the year 1555. and was so still, till the year 1557. when
the Duke of _Guise_ took it, whence we gather that it was a secure place
that had enjoyed so long a rest.

The second is, that those of _Diepe_ did watch for the _Spaniards_, in
the passage between _Dover_ and _Calais_, therefore the Author saith,
_They shall seek Port Selyn_, _Selyn_ Port or Harbour is always taken by
the Author for an Harbour in the _Ocean_.

The third is, that the great fight between the _French_ and the
_Spaniards_ was by fire, so that most part of the Ships on each side were
burnt, and the _Spanish_ and _French_ Souldiers did cast themselves into
the Sea, to save their lives in their enemies Ships, where they were
slain.

The fourth is, that those of _Diepe_ being extraordinary skilful in
Sea-fights had made great quantity of artificial fires, to cast into the
_Spanish_ Ships, but the Ships grapling one with another, they were burnt
on both sides.

Upon those four circumstances the two first Verses say, that _the Legion
in the Fleet Calcineth magnes_, that is Loadstone burnt, and shall _burn
Pitch and Brimstone_, to make Artificial fires.

The third and fourth Verse say, that this _Sea Legion_ shall seek an
Harbour in the Ocean, which shall be _a secure place, by a long rest_,
that is _Calais_. She will seek that _Selyn_ Harbour to shelter her self,
because _Calais_ did then belong to the _English_, but by reason of the
narrowness of the _Sea_, the _French_ watched for the _Spaniards_ there,
and to shew that they sought onely for _Calais_ to meet the _Spaniards_,
they carried the _Spanish_ Ships which they took into _Diepe_, and not
into _Calais_.

The _French_ Impression hath a fault here, putting _Port Hercle_ instead
of _Port Selyn_, which is a manifest error, for the taking of _Port
Hercle_ by the _Florentines_ the 14. of _June_ 1555. was by a Land Army,
besides, that _Port Selyn_ is always taken by the Author for a Port in
the Ocean.


XXIV.

    French.

    Ouy soubs Terre Sainte Dame voix feinte,
    Humaine flamme pour Divine voir luire,
    Fera des sœurs de leur sang Terre tainte,
    Et les Saints Temples par les impurs destruire.

    English.

    Under ground shall be heard the fained voice of a Holy Dame,
    An humane flame to see a Divine one,
    Shall cause the ground to be died with the sisters blood,
    And the Holy Temples to be destroyed by the wicked.

ANNOT.

Every one may understand this as well as I.


XXV.

    French.

    Corps sublimes sans fin a l’œil visibles,
    Obnubiler viendront par ces raisons,
    Corps, front compris, sens & chef invisibles,
    Diminuant les Sacrées Oraisons.

    English.

    The Celestial bodies that are always visible to the eye,
    Shall be darkened for these reasons,
    The body with the forehead sense and head invincible.
    Diminishing the Sacred Prayers.

ANNOT.

This is of the same nature as the foregoing.


XXVI.

    French.

    Lou grand Cyssame se levera d’abelhos,
    Que non lauran don te siegen venguddos,
    Denuech lenbousq, lun gach dessous las treilhos,
    Ciutad trahido per cinq lengos non nudos.

    English.

    The great swarm of Bees shall rise,
    And it shall not be known whence they come,
    Towards the Ambush so the Jay shall be under a Vine,
    A City shall be betray’d by five tongues not naked.

ANNOT.

The Author having made this Stanza in the _Provencal_ Language, that was
his Mother Tongue, which hath very little relation to the rest of the
_French_ tongue, hath put me to some trouble to understand it; at last
I found the meaning to be this, that when a great swarm of Bees shall
light on some place, and it shall not be known whence they came, then
shall be seen a Jay under a Vine, and a City shall be betrayed by five
several Nations.


XXVII.

    French.

    _Salon_, _Mansol_, _Tarascon_, _de Sex_, Larc,
    Ou est debout encor la _Pyramide_,
    Viendront livrer le Prince _Denemark_,
    Rachat honny au Temple d’_Artemide_.

    English.

    _Salon_, _Mansol_, _Tarascon_, _Desex_, the arche,
    Where to this day standeth the _Pyramis_,
    Shall come to deliver the Prince of _Denmark_,
    A shameful ransom shall be paid in the Temple of _Artemis_.

ANNOT.

_Salon_, _Mansol_, _Tarascon_, _Desex_, are Towns in _Provence_ and
_Languedo_.

By the _Arch_, here is meant the Triumphal Arch of _Caius Marius_, which
he erected after the defeat of the _Cimbres_ and _Teutons_, and remaineth
to this day in that Province, within two or three Leagues off the Town of
_Orenge_.

_Artemis_ is an Epethete of _Diana_, so called ’πο τοῦ ἀερὰ τεμνειν, _a
secando aerem_.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Lors que _Venus_ du Sol sera couvert,
    Soubs la splendeur sera la forme occulte,
    _Mercure_ au feu les aura descouvert,
    Par bruit Bellique sera mis a l’Insulte.

    English.

    When _Venus_ shall be covered by the Sun,
    Under the splendor of it shall be an occult form,
    _Mercury_ in the fire shall discover them,
    And by a Warlike rumor shall be provoked.

ANNOT.

If this Book cometh ever into the hands of _Hermes_’s Disciples, I
shall desire they would consider diligently this Stanza, and the three
following; for they are all concerning the _Elixir_ of the Philosophers,
or the making of the Philosophers stone. To begin with this:

_When ~Venus~ shall be covered by the Sun._

This is the Astral point, so much sought after by the Philosophers, for
the beginning of their work, without the knowledge of which they cannot
begin their work, or come to any good.

_Under the splendor of it shall be an occult form_, that is, under that
conjunction lyeth a great mystery.

_~Mercury~ in the fire shall discover them_, _viz._ Mercury of the
Philosophers, made by Cœlestial fire.

_And by a Warlike rumor shall be provoked_; that is, the Planet of
_Mercury_ shall be provoked to mix his variable and changable disposition
with theirs, by his Aspects, Oppositions, Conjunctions, &c. It is not
possible to speak more plainly.


XXIX.

    French.

    Le Sol caché, eclipsé par _Mercure_,
    Ne sera mis que pour le Ciel second,
    De _Vulcan_ _Hermes_ sera faite Pasture,
    Sol sera veu pur, rutilant & blond.

    English.

    The Sun shall be hid and eclipsed by _Mercury_,
    And shall not be set but for the second Heaven,
    _Hermes_ shall be made a prey to _Vulcan_,
    And after that the Sun shall be seen pure, shining and yellow.

ANNOT.

Here I must lead the Reader with _Ariadnes_ Thread, that he may extrecate
himself out of this Labyrinth.

_The Sun shall be hid and Eclipsed by ~Mercury~_; that is, Gold shall be
Eclipsed and dissolved by the Philosophers Mercury, which is the Key and
foundation of all the work.

_And shall not be set but for the second Heaven_; that is, shall not be
used till you come to the second part of the work, which is that of the
Furnace.

_~Hermes~ shall be made a prey to ~Vulcan~_; that is, the matter and
composition of the _Elixir_, shall be put upon the fire in a Furnace.

_And after that the Sun shall be seen pure, shining, yellow_; that is,
in conclusion after projection made, thou shalt see pure, shining, and
Yellow Gold.


XXX.

    French.

    Plus d’unze fois Luna Sol ne voudra,
    Tous augmentes & baissez de degre,
    Et si bas mis que peu d’Or on coudra,
    Qu’apres faim, peste, descouvert le secret.

    English.

    The Moon will not have the Sun above eleven times,
    Then both shall be encreased and lessened in degree,
    And put so low, that a little Gold shall be sowed up,
    So that after hunger and plague, the secret shall be discovered.

ANNOT.

_The Moon will not have the Sun above eleven times_; that is, the Moon of
the Philosophers will not imbibe their Sun above Eleven times.

_Then both shall be encreased and lessened in degree_; that is, both shall
be encreased in quality, and lessened in quantity.

_And put so low that a little Gold shall be sowed up_; that is, the
powder of projection, or Philosophers stone shall be so small in Bulk,
that one may sow it about him, and hide it in his Cloths.

_After famine and plague the secret shall be discovered_; that is,
somebody shall die, with famine or plague, about which the secret shall
be found and discovered.


XXXI.

    French.

    La Lune au plain de nuit sur le haut Mont,
    Le nouveau _Sophe_ d’Un seul cerveau la veu,
    Par ses Disciples estre immortel semond,
    Yeux au Midy, enfin, mains corps au feu.

    English.

    The Moon at full by night upon the high Mount,
    The new _Sophe_ with one onely Brain hath seen it,
    Invited by his Disciples to become immortal,
    His eyes to the South, conclusion, his hands and body to the fire.

ANNOT.

_Sophe_ in Greek signifieth a wise man or Philosopher, who shall find the
Philosophers stone, when the Moon shall come to the full in the night
upon a high Mount. His Disciples shall perswade him to make himself
immortal, they being perswaded that the _Elixir_ cureth all diseases.

The last Verse saith, _His eyes to the South, his hands and body to
the fire_; that is, this Chymist or _Adeptus_, shall retire into some
Southern Countrey to work.

I cannot omit here that a conceited Chymist in _Paris_, whose name was
_Haumont_, in _English_, _Highmount_, could not be disswaded but our
Author spake of him in this Stanza, and that he could not die till he had
got the Philosophers stone, but to other matters.


XXXII.

    French.

    Es lieux & temps chair au poisson donra lieu,
    La loy commune sera faite au contraire,
    Vieux tiendra fort puis osté du milieu,
    Le _Panta_, _Choina_, _Philon_ mis fort arriere.

    English.

    In places and times, flesh shall give place to fish,
    The common Law shall be made against it,
    The old man shall stand fast, then being taken away
    The _Panta_, _Choina_, _Philon_, shall be set aside.

ANNOT.

_Panta_, _Choina_, _Philon_, are three Greek words, παντὰ χοινα φιλῶν,
which signifie in Latine, _omnia inter amicos communia_, and in
_English_, all things are common among friends. The rest is easie.


XXXIII.

    French.

    _Jupiter_ joint plus _Venus_ qu’a la Lune,
    Apparoissant de plenitude blanche,
    _Venus_ cachée soubs la blancheur _Neptune_,
    De _Mars_ frappée par la gravée branche.

    English.

    _Jupiter_ being more joyned to _Venus_ then to the Moon,
    Appearing in a full whiteness,
    _Venus_ being hid under the whiteness of _Neptune_,
    Stricken by _Mars_ through the ingraved branch.

ANNOT.

These terms being _Astronomical_ and _Astrological_, it is hard to guess
at the Authors mind.


XXXIV.

    French.

    Le grand mené captif d’estrange Terre;
    Dor enchainé au Roy _Cheyren_ offert,
    Qui dans _Ausonne_, _Milan_ perdra la Guerre,
    Et tout son Ost mis a Feu & a Fer.

    English.

    The great one brought Prisoner from a far Countrey,
    And chained with Gold, shall be presented to the King _Chyren_,
    Being then at _Ausone_. _Milan_ shall loose the War.
    And all its Host shall be put to fire and sword.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that when a great one from a far Countrey, shall
be brought Prisoner chained with gold, and presented to a King called
_Henry_ (for _Cheyren_ by transposition of letters is _Henry_) who then
shall beat _Bordeaux_; _Milan_ shall loose a great Army.


XXXV.

    French.

    Le feu esteint, les vierges trahiront,
    La plus grand part de la bande nouvelle,
    Pouldre a feu les seuls Rois garderont,
    _Hetrusque_ & _Corse_, de nuit, gorge alumelle.

    English.

    The fire being put out, the Virgins shall betray,
    The greatest part of the new troup,
    Gunpowder, Lance, shall keep only the Kings,
    In _Hetruria_ and _Corsica_ by night throats shall be cut.

ANNOT.

_Hetruria_ is the Country _Tuscany_ now under the Duke of _Florence_,
and _Corsica_ is an Island in the _Mediterranean_ Sea belonging to the
_Genoese_. The rest is plain.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Les jeux nouveaux en _Gaule_ redressez,
    Apres Victoire de l’_Insubre_ Campagne,
    Monts d’_Hesperie_, les grands liez troussez,
    De peur trembler la _Romagne_ & l’_Espagne_.

    English.

    The new plays shall be set up again in _France_,
    After the Victory obtained in _Piemont_,
    Mountains of _Spain_, the great ones tied, carried away,
    _Romania_ and _Spain_ shall quake for fear.

ANNOT.

This is a Prognostication of the rejoycing that should be in _France_,
after the winning of that famous battle _Serizoles_ in _Piemont_, against
the Armies of the Emperour and the King of _Spain_.


XXXVII.

    French.

    _Gaulois_ par saults Monts viendra penetrer,
    Occupera le grand Mont de l’_Insubre_,
    Au plus profond son Ost sera entrer,
    _Genes_, _Monech_ pousseront classe rubre.

    English.

    The _French_ by leaping shall go over the Mountains,
    And shall seize upon the great Mount of the _Savoyard_,
    He shall cause his Army to go to the furthermost,
    _Genoa_, and _Monaco_ shall set out their red Fleet.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning _Henry_ the IV. King of _France_, who went
over the _Alpes_ and conquered the Duke of _Savoy_’s Countrey, because
he would not restore the Markdom of _Salvees_. _Genoa_ and _Monaco_ are
Cities near _Savoy_.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    Pendant que Duc, Roy, Roine occupera,
    Chef _Bizantin_ captif en _Samothrace_,
    Avant lassault l’un l’autre mangera,
    _Rebours_ ferré suivra du sang la trace.

    English.

    While the Duke shall busie the King and the Queen,
    A great man of _Constantinople_ shall be prisoner in _Samothracia_,
    Before the assault one shall eat up the other,
    _Rebours_ shod shall trace one by the blood.

ANNOT.

The three first Verses are plain, as for the fourth, either it is falsly
Printed, or I must confess I understand it not.


XXXIX.

    French.

    Les _Rhodiens_ demanderont secours,
    Par le neglect de ses hoirs delaissée,
    L’Empire _Arabe_ ravalera son cours,
    Par _Hesperie_ la cause redressée.

    English.

    The _Rhodiens_ shall ask for succours,
    Being forsaken by the neglect of her Heirs,
    The _Arrabian_ Empire shall slack his course,
    By the means of _Spain_ the case shall be mended.

ANNOT.

By the _Rhodians_ are understood the Knights of _Maltha_, because they
dwelt first at _Rhodes_.

By the second Verse it is said, it was _the neglect of her Heirs_, that
is of the Heirs of _Rhodes_ the Knights of _Maltha_, who being careless
of themselves, were besieged by _Solyman_, which constrained them to ask
succours of all the Christian Princes, which came very slowly, at last
_Dom Garcia_ Viceroy of _Sicily_ relieved them, and drove away the Turks
that had suffered great loss, therefore the Author saith in the third
Verse, _The ~Arabian~ Empire shall slack his course_.


XL.

    French.

    Les Forteresses des Assiegez serrez,
    Par poudre a feu profondez en abysme,
    Les proditeurs seront tous vifs serrez,
    Onc aux _Sacristes_ navint si piteux schisme.

    English.

    The strong places of the Besieged shall be straightned,
    By Gunpowder they shall be plonged into a pit,
    The Traytors shall be shut up alive,
    Never did happen so pitiful schisme to the _Sacristes_.

ANNOT.

By the _Sacristes_, he understandeth the Clergy of the Roman Religion.


XLI.

    French.

    _Gynique_ Sexe captive par Hostage,

    Le Chef du Camp deceu par son language,
    Lairra la gente, sera piteux a voir.

    English.

    _Gynical_ sexe being captive by Hostage,
    Shall come by night to deceive her keepers,
    The Chief of the Camp being deceived by her Language,
    Shall leave her folks, a thing pitiful to behold.

ANNOT.

_Gynical_ Sex is a woman from the Greek word γυνὴ, which signifieth a
woman.

The meaning then of this Stanza is, that a woman being given in Hostage,
and made prisoner, shall deceive her keepers, and among the rest, the
chief Captain who shall forsake his Troops and run away with her.


XLII.

    French.

    _Geneve_ & _Langres_ par ceux de _Chartre_ & _Dole_,

    And by one of _Grenoble_ captive at _Montlimar_,
    _Seisset_, _Lozanne_ by a fraudulent deceit,
    Shall betray them for thirty pounds weight of Gold.

    English.

    There shall be heard in the Air noise of Weapons,
    And in that same year the Divines shall be enemies,
    They shall unjustly put down the Holy Laws,
    And by the Thunder and the War true believers shall die.

ANNOT.

There is no obscurity in this.


XLIV.

    French.

    Deux gros de _Mende_, de _Rhodez_, & _Millaud_,

    Par _Perigort_ au toc de la Campano.

    English.

    Two great ones of _Mende_, of _Rhodez_ and _Milliaud_,
    _Cahors_, _Limoges_, _Castres_ an evil week,
    By night the entry shall be from _Bourdeaux_ one cailhau,
    Through _Perigort_ at the ringing of the Bell.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is half _French_ and half _Provencal_ language.

All the Cities named here, _Mende_, _Rhodez_, _Milliaud_, _Cahors_,
_Limoges_, _Castres_, _Bourdeaux_, _Perigort_, are Cities of _France_,
bordering upon _Provence_, which is the Countrey wherein our Author was
born.

The meaning of it is, that all those Cities shall rise against the
Collectors of the Kings Taxes, and shall set upon them by the sound of
the Bell, which is already come to pass, and may come to pass yet.


XLV.

    French.

    Par conflict, Roy Regne abandonera,
    Le plus grand Chef faillira au besoing,
    Morts, profligez peu en rechapera,
    Tous destrenchez un en sera tesmoin.

    English.

    By a Battle the King shall forsake his Kingdom,
    The greatest Commander, shall fail in time of need,
    They shall be killed and routed, few shall escape,
    They shall be cut off, one only shall be left for a witness.

ANNOT.

This is a Prognostication of a great Battle, by the loss of which a King
shall forsake his Kingdom, his chief Commander having deserted him in
time of need. The slaughter shall be so great, that none shall be left
but one for a witness.


XLVI.

    French.

    Bien defendu le fait par excellence,
    Garde toy _Tours_ de ta proche ruine,
    _Londres_ & _Nantes_ par _Rheims_ fera defence,
    Ne passes outre au temps de la bruine.

    English.

    The fact shall be defended excellently well
    _Tours_ beware of thy approaching ruine,
    _London_ and _Nantes_ by _Rhemes_ shall stand upon their defence,
    Do not go further in foggy weather.

ANNOT.

_Tours_ is the chief City of a Province in _France_, called _Touraine_,
which is commended here for having resisted excellently well; but
is forewarned to look to her self after that, and to beware of her
approaching ruine.


XLVII.

    French.

    Le noir farouche quand aura essayé,
    Sa main sanguine par feu, fer, arcs tendus,
    Trestout le peuple sera tant effrayé,
    Voir les plus grands par col & pieds pendus.

    English.

    The wild black one, after he shall have tryed,
    His bloody hand by fire, Sword, bended Bows,
    All the people shall be so frighted,
    To see the greatest hanged by the neck and feet.

ANNOT.

It is a description of a Tyrant, who after he shall have tryed his
bloody hand by Fire, Sword, and bent Bows, shall cause his chief men to
be hanged by the neck and feet. Since the Author did write there had
been such a Tyrant in the world, namely, _John Basilides_, great Duke of
_Russia_, in the year 1572. Read _Paul Osburne_ in his Life.


XLVIII.

    French.

    Planure _Ausone_ fertile spacieuse,
    Produira taons, & tant de sauterelles,
    Clarte solairé deviendra nubilense,
    Ronger le rout, grand peste venir delles.

    English.

    The Plain about _Bourdeaux_ fruitful and spacious,
    Shall produce so many Hornets and so many Grashopers,
    That the light of the Sun shall be darkened,
    They shall crap all, a great plague shall come from them.

ANNOT.

I cannot find in History that this hath yet happened, since the writing
of these Prophecies, therefore I reckon it _de futuro_.


XLIX.

    French.

    Devant le peuple sang sera respandu,
    Qui du haut Ciel ne viendra esloigner,
    Mais d’un long temps ne sera entendu,
    L’Esprit d’un seul le viendra tesmoigner.

    English.

This Prophecie is concerning some just person, that shall be murdered
openly: His blood shall cry to Heaven, but shall not be heard for a good
while, till at last it shall be discovered by some body.

    English.

    _Libra_ shall see _Spain_ to Reign,
    And have the Monarchy of Heaven and Earth,
    No body shall see the forces of _Asia_ to perish,
    Till seven have kept the Hierarchy successively.

ANNOT.

_Libra_ is one of the twelve signs of the _Zodiack_, which is favourable
to _Spain_, so that the meaning of this is, that _Libra shall see ~Spain~
to Reign_.

And besides that, _to have the Monarchy of Heaven and Earth_; that is, to
have the command of the Pope, and of the best part of _Europe_. So that
no _Asian_ or _Turkish_ forces shall receive damage by the Christians,
till seven Popes of the _Spanish_ faction have Reigned successively, and
one after another.


LI.

    French.

    Un Duc cupide son ennemy poursuivre,

    A Duke being earnest in the pursute of his enemy
    Shall come in, hindering the Phalange,
    Hastened on foot shall follow them so close,
    That the day of the Battle shall be near _Ganges_.

ANNOT.

A _Phalange_, in Latine _Phalanx_, is a Squadron of Souldiers, which word
was anciently proper only to the _Macedonians_. _Ganges_ is a River in
_India_.


LII.

    French.

    En Cité obsesse aux murs hommes & femmes,
    Ennemis hors, le chef prest a soy rendre,
    Vent sera fort encontre les gens darmes,

    The enemies without, the Governour ready to surrender,

a City shall be driven away from their enterprise, by Lime, Dust, and
Ashes, scattered and dispersed against them by a mighty wind.

    There was never a Lightning so much feared,
    _Italy_ shall tremble, _Spain_ and the _English_,

ANNOT.

This foretelleth that when a _French_ King shall have a name that never
any of his Predecessors had, he shall be so much feared as that _Italy_,
_Spain_, and _England_ shall tremble, and that besides he shall be much
given to women.


LV.

    French.

    Quand la Corneille sur Tour de Brique jointe,
    Durant sept heures ne fera que crier,

    English.

    When the Crow upon a Tower made of Brick,
    For seven hours shall do nothing but cry,
    Death shall be foretold, and the Statue died with blood,

ANNOT.

This extraordinary Prodigy of a Crow crying for seven hours together upon
a Brick Tower, foretelleth that some notorious Tyrant shall be put to
death, and his statue sprinkled with blood, and withall, that the people
either for joy or fear shall be much given to prayer.


LVI.

    French.

ANNOT.

It is a Conquerour who having been much railed at by his enemies, shall
in conclusion after he hath overcome them, take a severe vengeance of
them.


LVII.

    French.

    Ignare envie au grand Roy supportée,
    Tiendra propos deffendre les escrits,
    Sa femme non femme par un autre tentée,
    Plus double deux ira au fort de cris.

    English.

    Ignorant envy being supported by the great King,
    Shall talk of prohibiting the writtings,
    His wife no wife, being tempted by another,
    Shall more then they two prevail by crying.

ANNOT.

Some ignorant envious person being in favour with the King, shall go
about to suppress learning, but the Kings wife no wife, that is his
Concubine, shall persuade him to the contrary, and shall prevail.


LVIII.

    French.

    Soleil ardent dans la gosier couler,
    De sang humain arrouser Terre _Etrusque_,
    Chef seille d’eau, mener son fils filer,
    Captive Dame conduite Terre _Turque_.

    English.

    Burning Sun shall be poured into the throat,
    This human blood shall wet the _Hetrurian_ ground,
    The chief pale of water, shall lead his son to Spin,
    A captive Lady shall be carried into the _Turkish_ Countrey.

ANNOT.

By burning Sun must be understood melted gold, which shall be poured into
ones throat, in the _Hetrurian_ ground, that is in _Tuscany_.

By the chief Pale of water is to be understood, some Water-bearer, who
shall make his son an Eunuch to make benefit on’t. The fourth Verse is
plain.


LIX.

    French.

    Deux assiegez en ardante ferveur,
    De soif estaints pour deux plaines Tasses;

    Two besieged, being in a burning heat,
    Shall die for thirst, want of two Bowls full,
    The Fort being filed, an old doting man,
    Shall show to the _Genoese_ the way to _Nizza_.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are plain. The two last Verses signifie that an old
doting man shall shew to the _Genoeses_ the way how to take _Nizza_, a
Town hard by them, by filing some Iron Grates, by which they shall get
into the Town.


LX.

    French.

    Les sept enfans en Hostage laissez,

    Deux par son fils seront d’estoc percez,
    _Genes_, _Florence_ les viendra seconder.

as I.


LXI.

    French.

    Le vieux mocqué & privé de sa place,
    Par l’Estranger qui le subornera,
    Mais de son filz mangé devant sa face,

    By the stranger that shall suborn him,
    But of his son shall be eaten before his face,
    The Brother at _Chartres_. _Orl._ shall betray _Rouen_.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is divided into two parts. The first part runneth from the
first Verse to the middle of the fourth. The meaning is, that an old
man shall be baffled and deprived of his place by a stranger that shall
suborn him, but that strangers sons brother shall be eaten up before his
face in the Town of _Chartres_; what he meaneth by eaten up, is hard to
guess, whether it be by poverty, sutes at Law, Envy, Lice, _&c._

The Hemisthikion of the last Verse, _~Orl.~ shall betray ~Rouen~_,
signifieth, that _Orleans_ shall betray _Rouen_.


LXII.

    French.

    Un Coronel machine ambition,
    Se saisira de la plus grande Armée,

    A Colonel deviseth a plot by his ambition,
    He shall seize upon the best part of the Army,
    Against his Prince he shall have a fained invention,
    And shall be discovered under the Harbour of the Vine.

ANNOT.

I never saw the last Tyrant _Cromwel_ better painted to the life, then in
the three first Verses.

As for the fourth, it is certain that his intention among his
Camerades was first discovered by him unto them at the _Star Tavern in
Coleman-street_, which is the place that the Author calleth the _Harbour
of the Vine_.


LXIII.

    French.

    L’Armée _Celtique_ contre les _Montagnars_,
    Qui seront sus & pris a la pipée,
    Paisants irez pulseront tost faugnars,
    Precipitez tous au fil de l’Espée.

    English.

    The _Celtique_ Army shall go against the _Highlanders_,
    Who shall stand upon their guard, and be taken with Bird-lime twigs,
    The Peasant being angry, shall roll down the stones,
    They shall be all put to the edge of the sword.

ANNOT.

This is a description of the attempt made by the _French_ upon _Savoy_,
which Countrey lieth in the Mountains of the _Alpes_, therefore called
here _Highlanders_; where the Peasants being incensed for the loss of
their goods and the ruine of their Countrey, rolled stones from the top
of the Mountains against the _French_ Army, which could not hinder them
from being destroyed; this came to pass under _Henry_ the IV. King of
_France_, in the year 1662.


LXIV.

    French.

    Le defaillant en habit de Bourgeois,
    Viendra le Roy tenter de son offence,
    Quinze Soldats la pluspart Villageois,
    Vie derniere & chef de sa chevance.

    English.

    The guilty, in a Citizens habit,
    Shall come to tempt the King concerning his offence,
    Fifteen Soldiers the most part Countrey men,
    The last shall be his life, and the best part of his Estate.

This signifieth that a great man having committed an offence against the
King, shall come to him in a mean habit, to sue for his Pardon, and shall
be carried away by fifteen Souldiers, the most part Countrey fellows;
and in conclusion he shall have his life saved, and the best part of his
Estate.


LXV.

    French.

    Au deserteur de la grand Forteresse,
    Apres qu’aura son lieu abandonné,
    Son adversaire fera si grand provesse,
    L’Empereur tost mort sera condamné.

    English.

    After that the desertor of the great Fort,
    Shall have forsaken his place,
    His adversary shall do so great feats,

ANNOT.

This is plain.


LXVI.

    French.

    Soubs couleur feinte de sept testes rasées,
    Seront formez divers explorateurs,
    Puits & Fontains de poison arrousées,
    Au Fort de _Genes_ humains devorateurs.

    English.

    Under the fained colour of seven shaven heads,
    Shall divers spies be framed,
    Wells and Fountains shall be sprinkled with poison,
    In the Fort of _Genoa_ shall be humane devourers.

ANNOT.

The three first Verses belong to the same sense; _viz._ that seven men
shall be spies, under pretence to be Priests or Monks, (which is the
meaning of the shaven heads) and shall poison the Wells and Springs.

The last Verse signifieth that in the Fort of _Genoa_, their shall be
devourers of men, that is, Usurers and Extortioners, which is no new
thing in that Nation.


LXVII.

    French.

    L’An que _Saturne_ & _Mars_ esgaux combust,
    L’Air fort seiché, longue trajection,
    Par feux secrets d’ardeur grands lieux adust,
    Peu pluye, Vent chauds, Guerres, Incursions.

    English.

    In the year that _Saturn_ and _Mars_ shall be fiery,
    The Air shall be very dry, in many Countreys,
    By secret fires, many places shall be burnt with heat,
    There shall be scarcity of Rain, hot Winds, Wars, in-roads.

ANNOT.

This is the Prognostication of a mighty dry season, and other accidents
that shall happen when _Saturn_ and _Mars_ shall be in a fiery
disposition, which whether it be by Opposition, Conjunction, Aspect, &c.
Let the Astrologers judge.


LXVIII.

    French.

    En l’an bien proche non esloigné de _Venus_,
    Les deux plus grands de l’_Asie_ & d’_Affrique_,
    Du _Rhine_ & _Ister_ qu’on dira sont venus,
    Cris, pleurs a _Malthe_, & coste _Ligustique_.

    English.

    In a year that is to come shortly, and not far from _Venus_,
    The two greatest ones of _Asia_ and _Affrica_,
    Shall be said to come from the _Rhine_ and _Ister_,
    Crying, and tears shall be at _Maltha_ and in the _Ligurian_ shore.

ANNOT.

The _Rhine_ is a River in _Germany_, _Ister_ is another in the Countrey
of _Istria_, belonging to the _Venetians_.

By the first Verse, I conclude that this Prophecy came to pass a little
while after the Author wrote this Book, when the grand Segnor _Solyman_
besieged _Maltha_, and put in fear all the _Ligurian_ Coast, which is
that of _Genoa_.


LXIX.

    French.

    La Cité grande les exilez tiendront,
    Les Citadins morts, meurtris & chassez,
    Ceux d’_Aquilee_ a _Parme_ promettront,
    Monstrer l’entrée par les lieux non tracez.

    English.

    The banished shall keep the great City,
    The Citizens being dead, murdered and expelled,
    Those of _Aquileia_ shall promise to _Parma_,
    To shew the entrance by unknown paths.

ANNOT.

_Aquileia_ and _Parma_ are two Cities in _Italy_. The rest is easie.


LXX.

    French.

    Bien contigu des grands Monts _Pyrenées_,
    Un contre l’Aigle grand copie, adresser,
    Ouvertes veines, forces exterminées,
    Que jusqu’au _Pau_ le chief viendra chasser.

    English.

    Near the great _Pyrenean_ Mountains,
    One shall raise a great Army against the Eagle,
    Veins shall be opened, forces driven out,
    So that the chief shall be driven as far as the _Pau_.

ANNOT.

By the Eagle here is understood the Empire; because his Ensign is an
Eagle.


LXXI.

    French.

    En lieu d’Espouse les Filles trucidées,
    Meurtre a grand faute, ne sera superstite,
    Dedans le puis vestues inondées,
    L’Espouse esteinte par haut d’Aconite.

    English.

    Instead of the Bride, the Maid shall be killed,
    The murder shall be a great fault, none shall be surviving,
    In the Well they shall be drowned with their Cloaths,
    The Bride shall be extinguished by an high Aconite.

ANNOT.

This is a Prophecie of a Tragical Nuptial, where all the Maids shall be
drowned with their Cloaths in a Well, insomuch that none shall survive,
and the Bride shall be poisoned, and die by _Aconite_, which is one of
the most poisonous herbs that is, witness _Juvinal_: _Lurida terribiles
miscent asonita novercæ._


LXXII.

    French.

    Les _Artomiques_ par _Agen_ & _Lectoure_,

    Saisir _Condon_ & _Marsan_ promptement.

    English.

    The _Artomiques_ through _Agen_ and _Lectoure_,
    Shall keep their Parliament at Saint _Fœlix_,
    These of _Bazas_ shall come in an unhappy hour,
    To seize upon _Condon_ and _Marsan_ speedily.

ANNOT.

By the _Artomiques_ he meaneth the Protestants; because they take the
Communion with leavened Bread, which in Greek is called _Artos_.

_Agen_, _Lectoure_, saint _Fœlix_, _Bazas_, _Condon_ and _Marzan_, are
Cities of _Gascony_. The rest is plain.


LXXIII.

    French.

    Le neveu grand par force prouvera,
    Le peche fait de Cœur pusillanime,
    _Ferrare_ & _Ast_ le Duc esprouvera,
    Par lors qu’au soir sera le _Pantomime_.

    English.

    The great nephew by force shall provoke,
    The sin committed by the pusillanimous heart,
    _Ferrara_ and _Ast_ shall make tryal of the Duke,
    When the _Pantomime_ shall be in the evening.

ANNOT.

To understand the whole sense of this, we must first know what is meant
by the particular terms.

The great Nephew is the Brother or Sisters son of some great person,

pusillanimous or fearful man.

_Ferrara_ and _Ast_ are two towns in _Italy_, shall make tryal of a Duke,

    Du lac _Leman_ & ceux des _Brannonices_,
    Tous assemblez contre ceux d’_Aquitaine_,

    English.

    From lake _Leman_, and from the _Brannonues_,
    They shall be gathered against those of _Aquitania_,
    Great many _Germans_, and many more _Switzers_,
    Shall be routed together with those of _Maine_.

ANNOT.

Lake _Leman_, is the Lake of _Geneva_. The _Brannonices_ are those of
_Sens_, so called; because they took _Rome_ under the Conduct of their
Captain _Brennus_, and afterwards built _Brenona_, a Town belonging since
to the _Venetians_, who calls it _Verona_.

_Aquitania_ is that Province of _France_, called now _Gascony_. _Maine_
is a Province in _France_. The rest needeth no explication.

    One being ready to fight, shall faint,
    The chief of the adverse party shall obtain the victory,
    The rearegard, shall withstand it out,
    Those that fall away shall die in the white Terretory.

ANNOT.

There is nothing difficult here, but what he meaneth by the white
Terretory, whether it be positive, or Allegorical, I leave the judgement
of it to the Reader.

    English.

    The _Nictobriges_ by those of _Perigort_,
    Shall be vexed as far as the _Rhosne_,
    The associate of the _Gascons_ and _Bigorre_,
    Shall betray the Church while the Priest is in his Pulpit.

ANNOT.

_Nictobriges_ in Greek signifieth a people living in a dark and moist
Countrey. _Perigort_ and _Bigorre_ are two Towns in _France_. The rest is
plain.

    Kingdoms shall be united, a Christian King of the world,
    Dying, shall desire to be buried in the Countrey of _Blois_,
    After he shall have driven the Pyrates from the Sea.

ANNOT.

_Selyn_ is the name of a _Turkish_ Emperour, the meaning therefore of
this, is, that under the Reign of one _Selyn_ a _Turkish_ Emperour,
_Italy_ shall be in peace, and all the Christian Princes united.

    English.

    The great Army belonging to the Civil War,
    Having found by night _Parma_ possessed by Strangers,

    The _Landes_ shall be full of _Bourdeloir_,

ANNOT.

_Monheurt_, _Marsan_, _Aiguillon_, are Towns in _Gascony_.

_Landes_ is a desert Countrey, wherein nothing groweth but Pine-trees,
_Bourdelois_ are those of _Bourdeaux_.

_Navarre_ is a Kingdom, and _Begorre_ a Province joyning to those
_Landes_, or Pine-trees Countrey.

    English.

    Near the great River, a great pit, Earth digged out,
    In fifteen parts the Water shall be divided,
    The City taken, fire, blood, cries, fighting,
    And the greatest part concerneth the Collisés.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was fulfilled, when _Rome_ was taken and sacked by
_Charles_ Duke of _Bourbon_, and _Philibert_ of _Chalon_ Prince of
_Orenge_, Generals of the Emperour _Charles_ the V. with such cruelties,
as never was committed by the bloody _Goths_ and _Vandales_, and to shew
that the Author intended _Rome_, is apparant by two instances. The first
is by _the great River_, which is the _Tyber_, which though not very
great in its Channel and depth, yet is very great, yea, the greatest in
_Europe_ by its fame. The other is the word _Colisée_, which is that
famous Arch of _Traian_ in _Rome_, remaining yet to this day.

    A Bridge of Boats shall suddenly be made,
    To pass over the Army of the great _Belgick_ Prince,
    In deep places, and not far from _Bruxelles_,
    Being gone over, there shall be seven cut with a Pike.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the Siege of _Antwerp_ by the Prince of _Parma_,
Governour of the _Low-Countreys_ for the King of _Spain_, who having
besieged, caused a Bridge of Boats to be made upon the River _Scheld_,
to hinder the succours of the _Hollanders_, who by that means were
constrained to surrender it.

    A great troop gathered, shall come from _Sclavonia_,
    The old Olestant shall ruine a City,
    He shall see his _Romania_ very desolate,
    And after that, shall not be able to quench that great flame.

ANNOT.

That great troop from _Sclavonia_ shall be the _Venetians_, because
they possess most part of that Countrey. _The old Olestant_ is their
Duke, because he is not chosen unless he be very old, by _Romania_ is
understood what the _Venetians_ possess in that Countrey.

    Being vanquished shall run away, overcome by few,
    His people being moved, shall make no small mutiny,
    His own son shall besiege him.

    In the year that _Mars_, _Venus_, and _Sol_ shall be in a conjunction
      in the Summer.

ANNOT.

_Auxerre_ is a City of _France_, distant from _Paris_ 40. leagues to the

    English.

    The white Coal shall be expelled by the black one,
    He shall be made Prisoner, carried in a Dung-cart,
    His feet twisted upon a black Camel,
    Then the youngest, shall suffer the Hobby to have more thread.

ANNOT.

The first Verse is altogether Allegorical and Metaphorical, therefore
I leave it to the judgement of every Reader. I shall only deliver my
opinion upon the whole: I take it to be some white Prince, that shall
be overcome by a black one, put in a Dungcart, after that, tied upon a
black Camel, and then the younger son of that black Prince shall give the
prisonner a little more liberty.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    L’An que _Saturne_ en eau sera conjoint,

    English.

    In the year that _Saturn_ in _Aquarius_ shall be in conjunction
    With _Sol_, the King being strong and powerful,
    Shall be received and Anointed at _Rheines_ and _Aix_,
    After Conquest he shall murder innocent persons.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is remarkable for the things that it foretelleth, _viz._
that in the year that _Saturn_ shall be in conjunction with _Sol_ in
the Sign of _Aquarius_, a King of _France_ shall be annointed both at
_Rhemes_ and _Aix_, for _Rhemes_ is a City in _France_, where the Kings
use to be Annointed and Crowned, and _Aix_ is another in _Germany_, where
the Emperours use to be so. But the last Verse is ominous, where he
saith, that after his Conquests he shall murder innocent persons.

    Un fils de Roy tant de Langues apprins,

    Shall fall out with his elder Brother for the Kingdom,
    His father in Law being more concerned with his elder son,
    Shall cause the principal adherent to perish.

ANNOT.

One King shall have two Sons, the eldest shall succeed him in the
Kingdom, the youngest having been well brought up and educated, shall
raise troubles, against the King his Brother; but he shall be destroyed
by the means of his own Father in Law.

    English.

    The great _Antony_ by name, but in effect sordid,
    Of _Phtyriasis_ shall at last be eaten up,
    One that shall be covetous of Lead,
    Going upon Port d’_Esleu_ shall fall into the Water.

ANNOT.

_Phtyriasis_ in Greek is the disease called by the Latines _Morbus
pedicularis_, when one is devoured by Lice, as were _Herodes_, _Sylla_,
_Pherecydes_, and _Philip_ II. King of _Spain_, &c.

As for Port d’_Esleu_, the question is, whether it be the proper name of
a place, or the name of a man, that shall throw another in the water.

    Thirty of _London_ shall secretly conspire,
    Against their King, upon the Bridge the Plot shall be made,
    These _Satellites_ shall taste of death,
    A King shall be elected, fair, and born in _Friezeland_.

ANNOT.

Here may be alleadged that passage of Scripture, _There is nothing so
secret but shall be revealed_; for here is plainly told the number of
those wicked persons, who conspired against their lawful Sovereign King
_Charles_ I. of blessed memory, as also the place where the Plot was
first laid; for it is well known that they used to assemble at the _Bear_
at the Bridge foot.

    English.

    The two Armies shall not be able to joyn by the Walls,
    At that instant _Milan_ and _Thesin_ shall tremble,
    Hunger, thirst, and fear shall so seize upon them,
    They shall not have a bit of meat, bread, nor victuals.

ANNOT.

_Milan_ is a City in _Italy_, and _Thesin_ is the River that passeth by
it.

    Au Duc _Gaulois_ contraint battre au Duelle,

    English.

    A _French_ Duke compelled to fight a Duel,
    The Ship of Mole shall not come near _Monaco_,
    Wrongfully accused shall have a perpetual Prison,
    His son shall endeavour to Reign before his death.

ANNOT.

To understand this Stanza, we must suppose four Histories, _Paradin_
relateth the first, which is, that the _French_ and _Spanish_ Armies
having their Winter quarters in the Dukedome of _Milan_, _Anno_ 1555.

The Marquess of _Pescaire_, sent word to the Duke of _Nemours_, by a
_French_ Gentleman, that he and three more desired to break a Lance with
him upon the borders of _Ast_.

The Duke accepted the challenge, without giving notice to the Marquess of
_Brissac_, then General of the _French_ Army, who was very angry at it,
nevertheless he advised the Duke to go, but not with a Guilt and light
Armour, but with a wrong one, such as became a Cavaliero, which he did
not do, nor the other three that went with him: whence it came, that the
Lord _Classe_ a _French_ man, running against _Malespine_, was wounded
to death in the shoulder; nevertheless one of the seconds to the Duke
of _Nemours_, the Lord _Moncha_ killed upon the place _Carassa_, Nephew
to pope _Marcel_ II. and the Lord _Manoa_, one of the Duke of _Nemours_
party, falling from his Horse a little wounded, broke his neck.

As for the Duke of _Nemours_, he ran twice against the said Marquess,
without hitting one another, but at the third time they both brake their
Lances, without doing any harm. Thus, _the French Duke was compelled to
fight a Duel_.

We have the second History from _Turpin_, and many others, which is,
that the Marquess of _Masseran_, having put himself into the King of
_France_’s service, in hopes to have the Government of _Bielais_; and
proving a Traitor, the Marshal of _Brissac_, who had discovered his
perfidiousness, resolved to take him in his house of _Gaillany_, which he
had fortified to secure his retreat after his Treason.

The Lord _de Termes_ was commanded to do it, which he did so dexterously,
that he took him into his house after dinner, and then compelled him
presently to surrender the Castle of _Jamaglia_, the Marquess obeying,
sent thither presently his son _Claudius_, to put it into the hands of
the Lords _de la Mante_, and of _Villars_.

These two viewing the Castle, to observe the places that might be
fortified, and going from room to room, heard a lamentable voice, crying.
_Have mercy upon me._ They caused presently the Prison doors to be
opened, and found a poor Gentleman of _Vercelle_, whom the Marquess had
detained there 18 years, for endeavouring to serve an execution against
him, in the Duke of _Savoy_’s behalf.

And it is remarkable that his Imprisonment was all this while concealed,
so that no body ever heard of it, in so much that his friends suspecting
he had been killed by one of his enemies, they prosecuted him so hard,
that after much tortering, he confessed what he had not done, and was
consequently put to death in the presence of the said Marquess of
_Masseran_, who knew the Countrey. Thus we see _one wrongfully accused_
that was executed, and this Gentlemans Imprisonment, which was to be
perpetual.

After this, they carryed the poor Gentleman almost all naked, and being
nothing but skin and bones, to the Lord of _Termes_, who caused him to be
clothed, and gave him Money to go back to his friends.

The third History is, that the Duke of _Nemours_ Son was one of the chief
ring-leaders of the League against _Henry_ IV. and did what he could
before he dyed to get the Kingdom of _France_, endeavouring first to make
himself Sovereign Prince of _Lion_, _Forrest_, and _Beaucolois_.

The fourth History is, that at the latter end of the year 1555. the Lord
_la Mole_ carrying to _Rome_ the Cardinals of _Tournon_ and _Lorrain_,
went directly to the Island of _Corsica_, whence he drew some Forces,
which he joyned to his, and to those of _Monluc_, and would not Land at
_Monaco_ for some reasons, but went directly to _Civita Vecchia_. By this
we understand that Verse of the Stanza. _The Ship of the Mole shall not
come near ~Monaco~._

    Teste trenchée du vaillant Capitaine,

    English.

    The head cut off the valliant Captain
    Shall be thrown down before his adversary,
    His body hanged at the Sails Yard,
    Confused, they shall fly with Oars against the Wind.

ANNOT.

These words are plain enough, though no body can tell whether the thing
is past already, or shall come to pass hereafter.

    French.

    Un Serpent veu proche du lict Royal,
    Sera par Dame nuict chien n’abageronts

    Du Ciel venu tous les Princes verront.

    English.

    A Serpent shall be seen near the Royal bed,
    By a Lady in the night, the Dogs shall not bark,
    Then shall be born in _France_ a Prince so Royal,
    Come from Heaven all the Princes shall see it.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to be an allusion to the Birth of _Alexander_ the great;
for it is said, that when his mother _Olympia_ proved with Child of him,
there was seen in her Bed, and about her Bed a great Serpent, which was
the presage of his future greatness: therefore our Author also will have,
that when such a Prodigie shall appear in _France_, that then shall be
born such a Prince as he mentioneth here: the circumstances are, that
this Serpent shall be seen by a Lady in the night time, and that the Dogs
of the house shall not bark at him.

    English.

    Two great Brothers shall be driven from _Spain_,
    The elder of them shall be overcome under the _Pyrenean_ Mountains
    Bloody Sea, _Rhosne_, Blood _Leman_ of _Germany_,
    _Narbon_, _Bliterre_ of _Agath_ polluted.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are easily understood by those that know the
_Pyrenean_ Mountains, to be those that part _Spain_ from _France_. The
two last Verses signifie there shall be bloody Wars in those places; the
_Rhosne_ is a swift River of _France_, that passeth through the City
of _Lyons_; _Leman_ is the Lake of _Geneva_, and _Narbon_ is a City of
_Languedock_.

    The Kingdom being left to two, they shall keep it but a little while,
    Three years and seven months being past, they shall make War,
    The two Vestals shall rebel against them,
    The youngest shall be Conquerour in the _Armorick_ Countrey.

ANNOT.

This signifies, that a Kingdom shall be left to two, who shall keep it
but a little while, about the space before mentioned.

By the two Vestals that shall rebel, are to be understood two Nuns, who
having Interest in the state by their nearness of blood, shall challenge
a title in the Kingdom. The last Verse signifies, that the youngest that
contended for the Kingdom, shall overcome the eldest, in the Province of
_Gascony_.


XCVI.

    French.

    La sœur aisnée de l’Isle _Britannique_,

    The eldest Sister of the _Brittain_ Island,
    Shall be born fifteen years before her Brother,
    By what is promised her, and help of the truth,
    She shall succeed in the Kingdom of _Libra_.

ANNOT.

This signifies, that the Princess born so long after her Brother, shall
be married to a King of _France_, which is understood here by the Kingdom
of _Libra_; therefore the last King _Lewis_ the XIII. was called _the
Just_, because born under the Sign of _Libra_.


XCVII.

    French.

    L’An que _Mercure_, _Mars_, _Venus_ retrograde,
    Du grand Monarque la ligne ne faillit,

    English.

    When _Mercury_, _Mars_ and _Venus_ shall retrograde,
    The Line of the great Monarch shall be wanting,
    He shall be elected by the _Lusitanians_ near _Pactole_,
    And shall Reign in Peace a good while.

ANNOT.

This signifies the late change of state in _Portugal_, when they threw
off the _Spanish_ yoke, and chose a King amongst themselves, _John_ the
IV. Duke of _Branganza_, Father to the present Queen of _England_;
for by the _Lusitanians_ are meant the _Portugals_, so called from
their Countreys name _Lusitania_; _Pactoles_ is the River that runs by
_Lisbonne_, otherwise called _Tagus_, in Greek χροσοροος from the Sands.

    English.

    The _Albanians_ shall pass through _Rome_,
    By the means of _Langres_ covered with half Helmets,
    Marquess and Duke shall spare no man,
    Fire, blood, small Pox, Water shall fail us, also Corn.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that when the people of _Albania_ lying between the
_Venetian_ Territories, and _Grecia_, shall come to _Rome_, by the means
of a Bishop of _Langres_, who is a Duke and Peer of _France_; being
_covered with half Helmets_, a kind of a Cap that they wear in War; then
shall be _fire, blood, small Pox, and want of Corn_.

    English.

    The valliant eldest son of the daughter of the King,
    Shall beat back so far those of _Flanders_,
    That he will cast Lightnings, O how many in such orders
    Little and far, after shall go deep in _Spain_.

ANNOT.

This is scarce to be understood of any body, but the present King of
_France_ _Lewis_ the XIV. who was the elder son, and born of Queen _Ann_,
Daughter to the King of _Spain_, who by his valour and fortune made last
year such progress in the Conquest of _Flanders_, that it hath caused
admiration in every body; insomuch that is he do the like this year,
it may be probably suspected, he will afterwards go deep into _Spain_
according to the contents of this Prophecy.

    Du feu Celeste au Royal edifice,

    English.

    Fire shall fall from the skies on the Kings Palace,
    When _Mars_’s light shall be Ecclipsed,
    A great War shall be for seven months, people shall die by witchcraft.
    _Rouen_, and _Eureux_ shall not be wanting to the King.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that when _Mars_ is Ecclipsed, the Lightning shall fall
on some of the King of _Frances_ Palaces, then shall be a great War, for
the space of seven Months, and many shall die by witchcraft; and _Rouen_
the chief City of _Normandy_, and _Eureux_ another of the same province,
shall stick fast to the Kings Interest.

    Two shall discourse together in the Church,
    Dagger in the heart by one, on Horse-back and Spurring,
    Without noise they shall bury the great one.

This is a further specification of the whole ruine of _Flanders_, before
which it shall happen, saith our Author, that two shall talk together in
the Church, and one shall stabb the other with a Dagger, and then take
Horse, and fly, the dead one being buried without Pompe or Ceremony.

    Seven Conspirators at a Banquet shall make their Iron glister
    Against three, out of a Ship:
    One shall carry the two Fleets to the great one,
    When in the Palle-malle the last shall shoot him in the forehead.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses foretell a Conspiracy of seven against three, one of
which seven shall carry both Fleets to some eminent person, at which time
he shall be shot in the forehead by the last of the seven.

    The Successor to the Dukedom shall come,
    Far beyond the _Tuscane_ Sea,
    A _French_ branch shall hold _Florence_
    In its Lap, to which the Sea-frog shall agree.

ANNOT.

By the two first Verses is meant a lawful Successor to the Duke of
_Tuscany_ who shall come to recover the said Dukedom, which shall then be
in the possession of the _French_.

It is hard to guess what he means by the Sea-frog, unless it be some
considerable Prince at Sea, which shall then be in League with the
_French_.


IV.

    French.

    Le gros Mastin de Cité dechassé,
    Sera fasché de l’estrange Alliance,
    Apres aux Champs avoir le Cerf chassé,
    Le Loup & l’Ours se donront defiance.

    English.

    The great Mastif being driven from the City,
    Shall be angry at the strange Alliance,
    After he shall have hunted the Hart in the Fields,
    The Wolf, and the Bear shall defie one another.

ANNOT.

By the strange Alliance is meant that which _Cromwel_ had with _France_,
to the prejudice of his Majesty of _England_, who is here meant by the
Mastif, a Creature, for which _England_ hath been famous.

By the Wolf and the Bear are meant the _French_ King and the _Switzers_,
or those of _Savoy_.


V.

    French.

    Sous ombre faincte d’oster de servitude,
    Peuple & Cité l’usurpera luy-mesme,
    Pire sera par fraus de jeune pute,
    Livré au Champ lisant le faux proësme.

    English.

    Under the fained shadow of freeing people from slavery,
    He shall usurpe the people and City for himself;
    He shall do worse by the deceit of a young Whore,
    For he shall be betrayed in the field reading a false proem.

ANNOT.

The two first are plain, and may be referred to the foregoing Stanza
concerning _Oliver_.

The last Verses are plain, and I leave them to the judicious Reader.


VI.

    French.

    Au Roy l’_Augur_ sur le chef le main mettre,
    Viendra prier pour la Paix _Italique_,
    A la main gauche viendra changer le Sceptre,
    De Roy viendra Empereur pacifique.

    English.

    The _Augur_ shall come to put his hand upon the Kings head,
    And pray for the Peace of _Italy_,
    In the left hand he shall change the Scepter,
    Of a King he shall become a peaceful Emperour.

ANNOT.

Although the _Augur_ in Latine signifieth one that telleth events of
matters by the flying voices, or sitting of Birds, yet it is taken also
(as here) for a Prelat or Clergyman, who shall put his hand upon a Kings
head, and pray for the peace of _Italy_, and shall put a Scepter in his
hand, and install him Emperour, what King this should be, is easie to be
conjectured by the Author, being a _French-man_, and setting down a King
without any Epithite, and this Prophecy is a confirmation of one before
of the same nature.


VII.

    French.

    Du _Triumuir_ seront trouvez les os,
    Cherchant profond Thresor ænigmatique,
    Ceux d’alentour ne seront en repos,
    Ce concaver Marbre & plomb Metallique.

    English.

    The bones of the _Triumuir_ shall be found out,
    When they shall seek for a deep and ænigmatical Treasure,
    Those there about shall not be in rest,
    This concavity shall be Marble and Metallick Lead.

ANNOT.

I suppose none so ignorant in the Roman History, but knows, that there
was a combination between _Octavius Cæsar_, _Marcus Antonius_, and
_Lepidus_, to make themselves Masters of the _Roman_ Empire, and to
divide it amongst themselves, this plot being made by three, was made by
the _Triumuiri_, the meaning then is, that when they shall go to seek for
a Treasure, they shall find the bones of one of those three persons, and
in that cavity that they shall have digged, they shall find Marble and
Lead.


VIII.

    French.

    Sera laissé le feu vif, mort caché,
    Dedans les Globes horrible espouventable,
    De nuict a classe Cité en poudre lasché,
    La Cité a feu, l’ennemy favourable.

    English.

    The fire shall be left burning, the dead man shall be hid,
    Within the Globes terrible and fearful,
    By night the Fleet shall shoot against the City,
    The City shall be on fire, the enemy shall be favourable unto it.

ANNOT.

The two Verses signifie, that fire shall be hid within Globes, I suppose
them to be Granado’s, or a Mine.

The two last Verses signifie, that the Fleet in the Harbour, or near it,
shall set the City on fire, and that they shall come out of the Fleet to
help to quench the fire, and so shall the enemy be favourable.


IX.

    French.

    Jusques au fond la grand Arche _Maluë_,
    Par chef Captif l’amy anticipé,
    Naistra de Dame front, face cheveluë,
    Lors par astuce Duc a mort attrapé

    English.

    To the bottom of the great Arch _Malüe_,
    By a Captain that is a Prisoner, the friend shall be anticipated,
    One shall be born of a Lady with a hoary face and forehead,
    Then by craft shall a Duke be put to death.

ANNOT.

The meaning of the first is unknown to me: I leave it to the Reader.

The sense of the last is as obvious to the meanest capacity, as the two
precedent are obscure.


X.

    French.

    Un chef _Celtique_ dans le conflict blessé,
    Aupres de Cave, voiant, siens mort abattre,
    De sang & playes & d’ennemis pressé,
    Est se couru par incogneus de quattre.

    English.

    A General of _Flanders_ wounded in Battle,
    Near a Cellar, seeing death to overthrow his people,
    Being much oppressed with blood, wounds and enemies,
    Is succoured by four unknown.

ANNOT.

This needeth no further interpretation, than that it seemeth to be near
its event.


XI.

    French.

    Mer par solaires seure passera
    Ceux de _Venus_ tiendront toute l’_Afrique_,
    Leur Regne plus _Saturne_ n’occupera,
    Et changera la part _Asiatique_.

    English.

    By solaries she shall pass secure,
    Those of _Venus_ shall hold all _Africa_,
    _Saturn_ shall hold their Kingdom no longer,
    And shall change the _Asiatick_ part.

ANNOT.

This is so obscure in words and sense, that I can judge no more than that
it signifies a great change in _Africa_ and _Asia_, which I suppose is
already come to pass by _Taffaletta_.


XII.

    French.

    Au pres du lac _Leman_ sera conduite,
    Par garse estrange Cite voulant trahir,
    Avant son meurtre a _Ausbourg_ la grand suite,
    Et ceux du _Rhin_ la viendront envahir.

    English.

    Near the _Leman_ Lake shall be a Plot,
    By a strange Whore to betray a City,
    Before she be kill’d her great retinue will come to _Ausbourg_,
    And those of the _Rhine_ shall come to invade her.

ANNOT.

We have said often before, that the _Leman_ Lake is that of _Geneva_. The
rest is so manifest, that it needs no interpretation.


XIII.

    French.

    Par grand fureur le Roy _Romain Belgique_,
    Veexer voudra par phalange _Barbare_,
    Furent grinssant chassera gent _Lybique_,
    Depuis _Pannons_ jusque _Hercules_ la bare.

    English.

    Through great anger the _Roman Belgick_ King,
    Shall come to vex with _Barbarian_ Troops,
    Gnashing with fury, he shall draw away the _Lybian_ people,
    From the _Pannons_ as far as _Hercules_.

ANNOT.

By the _Roman Belgick_ King, is understood _Philip_ the second King of
_Spain_; because he was made King in _Flanders_, by his father _Charles_
V.

The second Verse signifieth the diverse Nations that his Army was
composed of.

In the third, by the _Lybian_ people are understood the _Jews_, which he
drove away from _Spain_ into _Africa_.

The _Pannons_ are the people of _Hungary_, called _Pannones_, and the
meaning that he drove them out as far as _Hercules_ Pillar, at the mouth
of the Straits, signifies the great expulsion he made of them, which were
about the number of 200000.


XIV.

    French.

    _Saturne_ & _Mars_ en _Leo Espagne_ captifue,
    Par chef _Lybique_ au conflict attrapé,
    Proche de _Malte_, Herede Prinse vive,
    Et _Romain_ Sceptre sera par _Coq_ frappé.

    English.

    _Saturn_ and _Mars_ being in _Leo_, _Spain_ shall be captive,
    By a _Lybian_ General taken in the Battle,
    Near _Malta_, an Heirse shall be taken alive,
    And the _Roman_ Scepter shall be strucken by the _Cock_.

ANNOT.

By the _Cock_ is meant the King of _France_. The rest is plain.


XV.

    French.

    En navigant Captif prins grand pontife,
    Grand apres faillir les clercs tumultuez,
    Second esleu absent son bien debife,
    Son favory Bastard a mort tué.

    English.

    In Sailing a Pope shall be taken Captive;
    After which, shall be a great uproar amongst the Clergy,
    A second absent elected, consumeth his goods,
    His favourite Bastard shall be killed.

ANNOT.

These Verses signifie no more, but that a Pope going by water, shall
be taken Prisoner, for which, all the Clergy shall be in disorder, and
elect a new one, who shall consume his Goods, and shall have a favourite
Bastard, that shall be killed.


XVI.

    French.

    A son haut prix plus la larme _Sabæe_,
    D’humaine chair par mort en cendre mettre,
    L’Isle _Pharos_ par _Croisars_ perturbée,
    Alors qua _Rhodes_ paroistra dur espectre.

    English.

    The _Sabæan_ Tear shall be no more at its high price,
    To turn humane flesh by death into ashes,
    The Island _Pharos_ shall be troubled by _Croisars_,
    When at _Rhodes_ shall a hard Phantasm appear.

ANNOT.

The _Sabæan Tear_, is Frankincense, so called; because it is the Gum of a
Tree that groweth in that Countrey, whence the Poet saith,

    _India mittit ebur, molles sua thura Sabæi._

The meaning therefore of the two first Verses, is, that Frankincense
shall be no more so dear as it hath been; because it shall be no more
used, in enbalming and burning of dead bodies.

The third verse saith, the Island _Pharos_ (which is that little Island
that lyeth before the Harbour of _Alexandria_) shall be troubled by
_Croisars_, that is, Christians, when there shall appear a Phantasme, or
a Vision shall be seen at _Rhodes_.


XVII.

    French.

    De nuit passant le Roy pres d’une _Andronne_,
    Celuy de _Cipres_ & principal de guerre,
    Le Roy failly la main fuit long du _Rhosne_,
    Les conjurez liront la a mort mettre.

    English.

    The King going along by night near an _Andronne_,
    He of _Cyprus_ and chief of the War,
    The King having missed the hand, runneth away along by the _Rhosne_,
    The Conspirators shall put him to death there.

ANNOT.

I could not find what he meaneth by _Andronne_, therefore I believe it is
a barbarous and forged word, which the Author hath foisted in, to make
the first Verses rhime with the word _Rhosne_ in the third Verse, which
is a famous River in _France_.


XVIII.

    French.

    De duel mourra l’infelix profligé,
    Celebrera son victrix l’Hecatombe,
    Pristine loy franc edict redigé,
    Le mur & Prince septiesme ira au tombe.

    English.

    The unhappy being overcome, shall die for grief,
    His Victrix shall celebrate the Hecatomb,
    The former law and free Edict shall be brought again,
    The wall and seventh Prince shall go to the Grave.

ANNOT.

_Victrix_ is a Latine word, and the Feminine Gender of _victor_, and
signifieth a woman that is victorious; _Hecatomb_ is a Sacrifice, wherein
an hundred Oxen are killed.


XIX.

    French.

    Le grand Royal d’Or, d’Airain augmenté,
    Rompu la pache par jeune, ouverte guerre,
    Peuple affligé par un chef lamenté,
    De sang barbare sera couverte Terre;

    English.

    The great Golden Royal, being increased with Copper,
    The agreement being broken by a young man, there shall be open War,
    People afflicted by the loss of a General lamented,
    The ground shall be covered with barbarous blood.

ANNOT.

By the great golden Royal, is understood (if I mistake not) a King rich
in Gold and Silver, who being joyned with one rich in Copper, shall make
open War against one that shall have broken his agreement.

_Quære_: Whether this came not to pass when _Gustaphus Adolphus_ King
of _Sweden_ and rich in Brass, being helped by the _French_ Gold and
Silver; was not the General so much lamented, after he had almost ruined
the Emperour, whom he did challenge to have broken his word, and had
covered the ground with _German_ and _Swedish_ blood.


XX.

    French.

    De la les _Alpes_ grand Armée passera,
    Un peu devant naistra monstre vapin,
    Prodigieux, & subit tournera,
    Le grand _Toscan_ a son lieu plus propin.

    English.

    Beyond the _Alpes_ shall a great Army go, and
    A little before shall be born a Vapin Monster,
    Prodigious and suddenly the great _Toscan_
    Shall return to his nearest place.

ANNOT.

What the Author meaneth by _vapin_, is unknown to me, as for the word
_propin_, it is a diminutive of the Latine word _propinquus_, by the
figure of Rhetorick, called _Tmesis_.


XXI.

    French.

    Par le trespas du Monarque Latin,
    Ceux quil aura par Regne secourus,
    Le feu livra divisé le butin,
    La mort publique aux hardis accourus.

    English.

    By the death of the Latine Monarque,
    Those that he shall have succoured in his Reign.
    The fire shall shine, the booty shall be divided,
    The stout comers in shall be put to publick death.

ANNOT.

Every body may judge of this as well as I, therefore to trouble my self
it should be to no purpose.


XXII.

    French.

    Avant qu’a _Rome_ grand aye rendu l’Ame,
    Effrayeur grande a l’Armée estrangere,
    Par escadrons l’embusche pres de _Parme_.
    Puis les deux rouges ensemble feront chere.

    English.

    Before that a great man yeildeth up his Soul at _Rome_,
    The Army of strangers shall be put into a great fright,
    By Squadrons the ambush shall be near _Parma_.
    After that, the two red ones shall make good cheer together.

ANNOT.

Here is nothing difficult, but what he meaneth by the two red ones, for
my part I suppose them to be two Cardinals.


XXIII.

    French.

    Les deux contens seront unis ensemble,
    Quand la pluspart a _Mars_ seront conjoints,
    Le grand d’_Affrique_ en effrayeur & tremble,
    _Duumuirat_ par la chassé desjoint.

    English.

    The two contented shall be united together,
    When the most part shall be joyned to _Mars_,
    The great one of _Africa_ shall be in fear and terrour,
    _Duumuirat_ shall by the pursuit be disjointed.

ANNOT.

This signifieth, that two powerful Princes shall joyn together, to
make War in _Africa_, which shall be much terrified at it, but this
_Duumuirat_, that is, this agreement of two Princes shall be broken off,
and disjoyned.


XXIV.

    French.

    Le Regne & Roy soubs _Venus_ eslevé,
    _Saturne_ aura sur _Jupiter_ Empire,
    La Loy & Regne par _Jupiter_ levé,
    Par _Saturnins_ endurera le pire.

    English.

    The Kingdom and King being raised under _Venus_,
    _Saturn_ shall have power over _Jupiter_,
    The Law and Reign raised by _Jupiter_,
    Shall be put to the worse by the _Saturnins_.

ANNOT.

I shall leave this to be expounded by those that have more skill in
Astronomy then I have.


XXV.

    French.

    Le Prince _Arabe_, _Mars_, _Sol_, _Venus_, _Lion_,
    Regne d’Eglise par Mer succombera,
    Devers la _Perse_ bien pres d’un Million,
    _Bizance_, _Ægypte_, _Ver._ _Serp._ invadera.

    English.

    The _Arabian_ Prince, _Mars_, _Sol_, _Venus_, _Leo_,
    The Kingdom of the Church shall be overcome by Sea
    Towards _Persia_ very near a Million,
    _Byzance_, _Ægypt_, _Ver._ _Serp._ shall invade.

ANNOT.

This is of the same nature as the foregoing, therefore I leave it to the
same expositors.


XXVI.

    French.

    La gent esclave par un heur Martial,
    Viendra en haut degré tant eslevée,
    Changeront Prince, naistra un Provincial,
    Passer la Mer, copie aux Monts levée.

    English.

    The Slavish Nation shall by a Martial luck
    Be raised to so high a degree,
    That they shall change their Prince, and elect one among themselves,
    They shall cross the Sea with an Army raised in the Mountains.

ANNOT.

This is so plain, that it needeth no interpretation.


XXVII.

    French.

    Par feu & armes non loin de la Mar negro,
    Viendra de _Perse_ occuper _Trebisonde_,
    Trembler _Pharos_, _Metelin_, Sol alegro,
    De sang _Arabe_ d’_Adrie_ couvert l’Onde.

    English.

    By Fire and Sword not far from the black Sea,
    They shall come from _Persia_ to seize upon _Trebisonde_,
    _Pharos_ and _Methelin_ shall quake, Sun be merry,
    The Sea of _Adria_ shall be covered with _Arabian_ blood.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy foretelleth clearly and plainly, that the _Persians_ shall
come to invade the Turkish dominions, a part of which is the Empire
of _Trebisond_, and that _Pharos_ and _Methelin_ two Islands in the
_Mediterranean_ Sea, shall quake for fear.

As also that the _Adriatick_ Sea, which is that Sea that belongeth to the
_Venetians_ shall be covered with Turkish blood, at which the Author is
so jocund, as with an exclamation he inviteth the Sun to be merry, and
rejoyce at it.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Le bras pendu & la jambe liée,
    Visage pasle, au sein poignard caché,
    Trois qui seront jurez de la meslée,
    Au grand de _Genes_ sera le Fer lasché.

    English.

    The arm hanging, and the leg bound,
    With a pale face, a Dagger in the bosom,
    Three that shall be sworn to the fray,
    To the great one of _Genoa_ the Iron shall be darted.

ANNOT.

This manifestly foretelleth a conspiracy of three men against the Duke
of _Genoa_, one of which three men, under the shew of a sore Arm, and
an impotent Leg, shall carry a Dagger in his bosom, with which he shall
stabb the said Duke.


XXIX.

    French.

    La liberté ne sera recouvrée,
    L’Occupera noir, fier, vilain inique;
    Quand la matiere du Pont sera ouvrée,
    D’_Hister_, _Venise_ faschée la Republique.

    English.

    The liberty shall not be recovered,
    It shall be occupied, by a black, fierce, and wicked villain;
    When the work of the _Hister_-Bridge shall be ended,
    The _Venetian_ Common-wealth shall be vexed.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is divided into two parts, the first of which is comprehended
in the two first Verses, _viz._ that the liberty of some politick body
(he nameth not which) shall not be recovered, but shall be seized upon,
by a black, fierce, and wicked villain.

The second part is contained in the two last Verses, wherein he saith,
that the Common-wealth of _Venice_ shall be in trouble, when the Bridge
made over the River _Hister_ shall be finished.


XXX.

    French.

    Tout a l’entour de la grande Cité,
    Seront Soldats logez par Champs & Villes,
    Donner l’assaut _Paris_, _Rome_ incité,
    Sur le Pont sera faite grand pille.

    English.

    Round about the great City,
    Soldiers shall lye in the Fields and Towns,
    Paris shall give the Assault, _Rome_ shall be attached;
    Then upon the Bridge shall be great plundering.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the taking and sacking of _Rome_, by the Duke of
_Bourbon_, General of _Charles_ V. Forces, therefore he saith that
_Paris_ shall give the Assault, because the said Duke of _Bourbon_ was a
_Frenchman_.


XXXI.

    French.

    Par Terre _Attique_ chef de la sapience,
    Qui de present est la Rose du Monde,
    Pont ruiné & sa grand preeminence,
    Sera subdite & naufrage des Ondes.

    English.

    In the Countrey of _Attica_ which is the head of wisdom,
    And now is the Rose of the World,
    A Bridge shall be ruinated with its great preeminence,
    It shall be subdued, and made a wrack by the Waves.

ANNOT.

He foretelleth the destruction of a famous Bridge in the Countrey of
_Attica_, of which _Athens_ is the chief City, and because it was always
famous for learning, he calleth it here the head of Wisdom; and that
Wisdom, the Rose of the World.


XXXII.

    French.

    Ou tout bon est, tout bien Soleil & Lune,
    Est abondant, sa ruine s’approche,
    Le Ciel s’advance a changer ta fortune,
    En mesme estat que la septiesme Roche.

    English.

    Where all well is, all good O Sun and Moon,
    Is existent, his ruine draweth near,
    The Heaven is making hast to change thy fortune,
    Into the same case as the seventh Rock is.

ANNOT.

By this dark Stanza, the Author seemeth to foretell the woful condition
of a Countrey that was happy before, but shall fall to ruine, I suspect
he intended _France_, because being a _Frenchman_ he did not name it,
for I think there was never such a change in the world as was in that
Kingdom, in the time of the Civil Wars between the Roman Catholicks, and
the Protestants.


XXXIII.

    French.

    Des principaux de Cité rebellée,
    Qui tiendront fort pour liberté r’avoir,
    Detrencher masles, infœlice meslée!
    Cris, hurlemens a _Nantes_ pitieux voir.

    English.

    Of the chief men in a rebelled City,
    Who shall stand out to recover their liberty,
    The Males shall be cut in pieces, O unhappy quarrel!
    Cries and houlings, it shall be pity to see at _Nantes_.

ANNOT.

The Author applyeth this Prophecie to the City of _Nantes_ in _Britany_,
but want of Books that treat of the History of that Countrey; I could
neither satisfie my self, nor the Reader, if this hath come to pass
already or not.


XXXIV.

    French.

    Du plus profond de l’occident _Anglois_,
    Ou est le chef de l’Isle _Britanique_,
    Entrera classe en _Garonne_ par _Blois_,
    Par Vin & Sel faux cachez aux barriques.

    English.

    From the deepest Westerly part of _England_,
    Where the chief of the _Britain_ Island is,
    A Fleet shall come into the _Garonne_ by _Blaye_,
    By Wine and Salt fire shall be hidden in Barrels.

ANNOT.

There is a notable and sensible error in the _French_ Copy, and without
reforming it, the sense is not only obscure, but also impossible; for
instead of _Blois_, which the Author hath put here, I suppose to make the
rime good, it must be written _Blaye_, which is a Sea Town of the mouth
of the River _Garonne_, and _Blois_ is a mid-Land Town, upon the River
_Loire_, about a hundred Leagues distant from the other.

The rest signifieth no more, but that there shall be some Warlike
Stratagem made use of by the _French_ (understood here by the names of
_Wine and Salt_) in puting fire into Barrels.


XXXV.

    French.

    Par Cité franche de la grand Mer _Seline_,
    Qui porte encor l’estomach la pierre,
    _Angloise_ classe viendra soubs la bruine,
    Prendre un rameau de grand ouverte guerre.

    English.

    By a free City of the _Selyne_ Sea,
    Which carrieth yet the stone in the Stomach,
    An _English_ Fleet shall come under a fog,
    To take a branch of great open War.

ANNOT.

What should the Author mean by the free City of the great _Seline_ Sea
that carryeth yet the stone in the Stomach, is hard to guess; for my
part I believe it to be _Venice_. First, because by the _Seline_ Sea, he
always understands the _Mediterranean_; because the great _Turks_ name in
our Authors time was _Selyn_, who was Master of the greatest part of it.
Secondly, there is no other free City so considerable as this. Thirdly,
by the stone in the Stomach, may be understood, the Pillars that are in
the _Piazza_ of St. _Mark_, and as it were in the Centre of _Venice_,
as the Stomach is in the Body. The sense therefore is this, as I take
it, that a considerable _Fleet_ shall come to _Venice_, or rather to
_Molamocco_, which is the Harbour, and there take a branch of great open
War, that is, to be either against the _Venetians_, or against the _Turk_
in their behalf.


XXXVI.

    French.

    De Sœur le frere par simulte feintise,
    Viendra mesler rosee en Mineral,
    Sur la placente donne a vieille tardive,
    Meurt le goustant, sera simple rural.

    English.

    The Brother of the Sister, with a fained dissimulation,
    Shall mix Dew with Mineral,
    In a Cake given to a slow old woman,
    She dieth tasting of, the deed shall be simple, and Countrey like.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth a notable poisoning that shall be done by a Brother
upon his Sister, which, because she died not fast enough, according to
his mind: and therefore called her _slow_, he would set her forward with
a poisoned Cake, the Poison was _Mineral_, and therefore _Arsenick_ or
_Sublimate_, mixed with _Manna_, called here _Dew_; because _Manna_ is
nothing but a _Dew_, condensed upon the Bark of a certain Tree; the
Conclusion is, that the woman shall die eating of it, though the meat
seemed to be simple and rural.


XXXVII.

    French.

    Trois sens seront d’un vouloir & accord,
    Qui pour venir au bout de leur attainte,
    Vingt mois apres tous eux & leurs records,
    Leur Roy trahy simulant haine, feinte.

    English.

    Three hundred shall be of one mind and agreement,
    That they may compass their ends,
    twenty months after by all them and their partners,
    Their King shall be betrayed, by dissembling a fained hatred.

    Shall be Elected to govern the tottering Ship.

The two first Verses foretell a schisme in the Church of _Rome_,
understood by a tottering Ship, and that a _French-man_ shall be Elected
Pope to remedy it.

The two last Verses are easie to be understood.


L.

    French.

    L’An que les Freres du Lys seront an Aage,

ANNOT.

The _Apennine_ Mountains, are those that divide _Italy_ in two parts.

Those under the Sign of _Libra_ are the people of _France_. _Feurs_ is a
City in _France_, in the Province of _Forrest_. Mount _Senis_ is a high
Mountain in Savoy.


LXII.

    French.

    War shall be near _Orgon_, and great evil at _Rome_,

ANNOT.

ANNOT.

What he meaneth by the lady _Ambraise_, I cannot find, the rest is easie.


LXVI.

    French.

    Sous les antiques edifices _Vestaux_,
    Non esloignez d’_Aqueduct_ ruiné,
    De Sol & Lune sont les luissans metaux,
    Ardente Lampe _Trajan_ d’or buriné.

    English.

    Under the ancient edifices of the _Vestals_,
    Not far from an _Aqueduct_ ruinated,
    Are the bright mettals of Sun and Moon,
    A burning Lamp of _Trajan_ of ingraven gold.

ANNOT.

Monsieur _Catel_ in his second Book of _Languedoc_ Chap. V. saith, that
there was a famous _Aqueduct_, which the _Romans_ builded from the River
_Gar_ to the Town of _Nismes_, which at present is ruinated.

Secondly, Near the Town there was a famous Temple dedicated to _Diana_,
where there is a Spring of water so great, that it seemeth rather a Lake
then a Fountain.

Thirdly, I find that the Emperour _Adrian_ caused a Temple to be built in
the honour of _Plotina_ _Trajan_’s wife.

Fourthly, He relateth that _Jean Poldo_ found in the Town of _Aix_ a
Marble with this inscription: _~Plotina~ ~Trajanis~ uxor, summa honestate
& integritate fulgens, sterilitatis defectu sine prole fecit conjugem,
qui ejus opera ~Adrianum~ adoptatum in Imperio Successorem habuit, a
quo in beneficii memoriam Nemausi æde sacra maximo Sumptu, sublimique
structura, ac Hymnorum cantu decorata, post mortem donata est_: That is
to say, _Plotina_, _Trajans_ wife, famous for her honesty and integrity,
was barren and left no Children to her Husband, which she perceiving,
intreated the Emperour to adopt _Adrian_ for his Son, and to make him
his Successor in the Empire, which being come to pass, the new Emperour
in acknowledgement of such a benefit, did build her a Temple of a
magnificent Structure, and caused it to be Consecrated with Musick after
her death.

Fifthly, The said Author saith, that this Marble was taken out of that
Temple, when the River of _Gardon_ did so overflow, as we have said.

By all this we see, that there was a Temple of _Vestals_ at _Nismes_,
_Diana_ the Maid being their chief Patroness, which is made now a
Nunnery, called _la Fontaine_. There is also to be seen the Temple of
_Plotina_, _Trajans_ wife, built by _Adrian_ his Successor. And as it was
the manner of the Ancients to put some of those inextinguishable Lamps in
their Graves; it is very likely, there was one of them in this Temple,
and because it should be known whose Grave it was, he caused _Trajans_
name to be Engraven in the foot of the said Lamp.

Let us explain now the Stanza: _Under the Ancient Vestal buildings of
the Temple of ~Diana~, not far from the ruined Aqueduct_, which carrieth
the water from the River _Gar_ to _Nismes_, _shall be found shining
mettals of ~Sol~ and ~Luna~_, that is, Meddals of gold and silver, with
_a burning Lamp of gold_, wherein the name of _Trajan_ was Engraven.
Histories make mention of several burning Lamps in this manner, that have
been found still burning in the ground, and not consumed, though they
had been there above 500 years; certainly the Oil of it must have been
incombustible, and could be extracted out of nothing but gold, _quia nil
dat quod non habet_.


LXVII.

    French.

    Quand Chef _Perouse_ n’osera sa Tunique,
    Sens au convert tout nud s’expolier:
    Seront prins sept faict Aristocratique,

    English.

    When the Chief of _Perouse_ shall not dare without a Tunick,
    To expose himself naked in the dark,
    Seven shall be taken for setting up Aristocracy,
    The Father and the Son shall die by pricks in the Collar.

_Perouse_ is a City in _Italy_; the rest is plain.

    English.

    In _Danubius_ and the _Rhine_ shall come to drink,
    The great Camel, and shall not repent;
    The _Rhosne_ shall tremble, and more those of _Loire_,
    And near the _Alpes_ the Cock shall ruine him.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth a great incursion of the _Turks_ into _Germany_,
insomuch that they shall water their Camels in the Rivers of _Danubius_,
and of the _Rhyne_, to the great terrour of _France_, wherein those
Rivers of _Rhosne_ and _Loire_ are.

But the last Verse, saith the Cock; that is, the _French_, shall overcome
and ruine the _Turks_, near the Mountains of the _Alpes_.


LXIX.

    French.

    Plus ne sera le grand en saux sommeil,
    L’Inquietude viendra prendre repos,

    English.

    The Regions under the sign of _Libra_,
    Shall make the Mountains quake with great War,
    Slaves of all sexes, with all _Bizance_,
    So that in the dawning of the day, they shall cry to Land to Land.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth the destruction of _Constantinople_, anciently called
_Byzantium_, by those that live under the Sign of _Libra_, that is, the
_Europeans_, and chiefly the _French_.


LXXI.

    French.

    Par la fureur d’un qui attendra l’eau,

    English.

    Along the _Rhosne_, the Messenger shall come too late.

ANNOT.

The words and sense are plain.


LXXII.

    French.

    Pour le plaisir d’Edict voluptueux,
    On meslera la poison dans la Loy,
    _Venus_ sera en cours si vertueux,

    English.

    By the pleasure of a voluptuous proclamation,
    The poison shall be mixed in the Law,
    _Venus_ shall be in so great request,
    That it shall darken all the allay of the Sun.

ANNOT.

By a Proclamation, favouring or promoting Licentiousness, poison shall
be mixed in the Law, and leachery so much countenanced, as it shall
obscurate the allay of the Sun, that is, piety so much commended in the
Gospel, to all those that will fight under Christs Banner.


LXXIII.

    French.

    Persecutée sera de dien l’Eglise,
    Et les Saints Temples seront expoliez,
    L’Enfant la mere mettra nud en chemise,
    Seront _Arabes_ au _Polous_ ralliez.

    English.

    The Church of God shall be persecuted,
    And the holy Temples shall be spoiled,
    The Child shall turn out his Mother in her Smock,
    _Arrabians_ shall agree with the _Polonians_.

ANNOT.

The Author could not be mistaken in this Prophecie; for the Church of
God shall always be persecuted, the Apostle confirmeth it, when he
saith, _that all those that will live piously in Christ, must suffer
persecution_: As for the spoiling of Churches, and other barbarous
actions, it hath been seen so often in _France_, in the time of the Civil
Wars for Religion, that it needeth no confirmation.

The last Verse concerning a peace between the _Turks_ and the
_Polonians_, was fulfilled in the year 1623. when _Sigismundus_ King of
_Poland_, by his Embassador the Duke _Šbarasky_, and by the mediation
of the _English_ Embassador, concluded a Peace with the great Turk
_Mustapha_, the Articles of which you may read at large in the _Turkish_
History.

    Tournant l’Eglise en pristine préeminence.

    English.

    Of _Trojan_ blood shall be born a _German_ heart,
    Who shall attain to so high a power,
    That he shall drive away the strange _Arrabian_ Nation,
    Restoring the Church to her former splendor.

ANNOT.

It seemeth to signifie, that by Alliance made between a _German_
Emperour, and a Daughter of _France_, which derive their Pedigree from
the _Trojans_, a Prince shall be born of so stout and valiant a heart,
as shall drive away all the _Turkish_ power out of _Germany_, and shall
restore the Church to her former splendor.

    He shall go up upon the good more on the right hand,
    He shall stay sitting upon the square stone,
    Towards the South; being set, on the left hand,
    A crooked stick in his hand, and his mouth shut.

I do acknowledge my Ignorance in this.

    En lieu libere tendra son Pavillon,

    Puis un Roy de _France_ le rendra Vulcanal.

    English.

    All the degrees of Ecclesiastical honour,
    Shall be changed into a Dial Quirinal,
    Into Martial, Quirinal, Flaminick;
    After that, a King of _France_ shall make it Vulcanal.

ANNOT.

All what I can say upon this, is, that _Dialis_ in Latine is a Priest of
_Jupiter_, and _Quirinal_ is a Priest of _Romulus_, _Martial Flamen_ is a
Priest of _Mars_, _Vulcanal_ is a Priest of _Vulcan_, let the ingenious
Reader make of all these the best construction he can.


LXXVIII.

    French.

    Les deux unis ne tiendront longuement,

    English.

    The two united shall not hold long,
    Within thirteen years to the Barbarian _Satrape_,
    They shall cause such loss on both sides,
    That one shall bless the Boat and its covering.

ANNOT.

The word _Satrape_ is a _Persian_ word, signifying one of the Grandees at
Court. By the last Verse is meant, one that shall save his life and make

    The sacred Pomp shall bow down her wings,
    At the coming of the great Lawgiver,
    He shall raise the humble and vex the rebellious,
    No Emulator of his shall be born.

    L’_Ogmion_ grande _Bizance_ approchera,

    And shall expel the Barbarian League,
    Of the two Laws, the wicked one shall yeild,
    The _Barbarian_, and the _French_ shall be in perpetual jar.

ANNOT.

By the word _Ogmion_, every where in his Book, the Author meaneth
the King of _France_, who according to his words shall come near
_Constantinople_, and shall break the Barbarian League, and of the two
Laws, that is, the Christian and the Mahometan, the Mahometan shall yield
to the other.

    Then the enemies shall be at the Gate for seven days.

ANNOT.

By the Royal Bird is meant an Eagle, which for seven days together shall
be observed upon some Eastern City, and shall be taken for a presage,

the enemies shall be at the Gate for seven days together.


LXXXII.

    Au conclud pache hors de la Forteresse,

    Shall not come he that was in despair,
    When those of _Arbois_, of _Langres_, against _Bresse_,
    Shall have put in _Dolle_ an Ambuscado of foes.

ANNOT.

The sense is, that according to the Articles or agreement made between
the Besieger of a Fort, and the Governour of it, the said Governour by
despair will not come out, and this shall happen, when those of _Arbois_
and _Langres_, shall be against those of _Bressia_, and shall have put an
Ambuscado in the City of _Dolle_.

    Those that shall have undertaken to subvert
    The Kingdom that hath no equal in power and victories,
    Shall cause by fraud, notice to be given for three nights together,
    When the greatest shall be reading a Bible at the Table.

ANNOT.

What place is meant by the unparalell’d Kingdom, the Author hath hid as
well from me as the Reader.

    French.

    Naistre du Gouphre & Cité immesurée,
    Nay de parens obscurs & tenebreux:
    Qui la puissance du grand Roy reverée,
    Voudra destruire par _Rouen_ & _Eureux_.

    English.

    One shall be born out of the Gulf and the unmeasurable City,
    Born of Parents obscure and dark,
    Who by the means of _Rouen_ and _Eureux_,
    Will go about to destroy the power of the great King.

ANNOT.

Without doubt by this Gulf and unmeasured City the Author means _Paris_,
by reason of its greatness, and the multitude of its Inhabitants.


LXXXV.

    French.

    Par les _Sueves_ & lieux circonvoisins,
    Seront en guerre pour cause des nuées:
    Gammares, locustes & cousins,
    Du _Leman_ fautes seront bien desnuées.

    English.

    Through _Swedeland_ and the Neighbouring places,
    By reason of the Clouds shall fall to War,
    The Lobstars, Grass-hoppers and Gnats,
    The faults of _Leman_ shall appear very naked.

ANNOT.

By _Leman_ is meant the City of _Geneva_, the rest needeth no further
interpretation.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    Par les deux testes, & trois bras separez,
    La grand Cité sera par eaux vexée;
    Des Grands d’entre eux par esgarez,
    Par teste _Perse_ _Byzance_ fort pressée.

    English.

    Divided in two heads and parted into three arms,
    The great City shall be troubled with Waters,
    Some great ones among them scattered by banishment,
    By a _Persian_ head _Byzance_ shall be sore oppressed.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy containeth three things, the first is an Inundation by
which _Paris_ is threatened, for without doubt he meaneth here that City,
at the head of which the River _Seine_ is divided in two heads, and makes
an Island where the Cathedral Church and the Palace are situated, and
then parted into three branches, one of which runneth by the Church of
the _Augustines_, the other by the _Quay_ of _la Megisserie_, and the
third passeth under the great Hospital; this City then is threatned here
of an Inundation, to which it is very subject, by reason of the lowness
of her situation, and the confluence of several Rivers that meet at the
head of it. The second part of the Prophecy hinteth that at that time,
some great ones of that City shall be banished; and the third, that
_Constantinople_, which was anciently called _Byzantium_; or rather the
great Turk by a figure of Rhetorick, called _Synecdoche_, shall be much
oppressed by the _Persians_.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    L’An que _Saturne_ hors de servage,
    Au franc terroir sera d’eau inondé,
    De sang _Troien_ sera son mariage,
    Et sera seur d’_Espagnols_ circondé.

    English.

    In the year that _Saturn_ out of slavery,
    In the free Countrey shall be drowned by water,
    With _Troian_ blood his marriage shall be,
    And for certain he shall be hedged about with _Spaniards_.

ANNOT.

By _Troian_ blood is understood the _French_ Nation, the meaning
therefore is, that in the year that a great Inundation shall be in
_France_, then shall a notable marriage be made, by which the _French_
shall be hedged about, or fenced by _Spaniards_.


LXXXVIII.

    French.

    English.

    Upon the sand through an hideous Deluge
    Of other Seas, shall be found a Sea Monster,
    Near to that place shall be made a Sanctuary,
    Which shall make _Savone_ a slave to _Turin_.

ANNOT.

When by the overflowing of the Neighbouring Seas, a Sea Monster shall be
cast upon the Sand, near to that Place shall be built a Fort, that shall
make _Savona_ a slave to _Turin_.

_Savona_ is a Town by the Sea side, belonging to the _Genoese_, _Turin_
is the chief City of _Piemont_, belonging to the Duke of _Savoy_.


LXXXIX.

    In _Hungaria_, through _Bohemia_ and _Navarre_,
    And by banners fained seditions,
    Through flower de Luce the Countrey that wears the Bar,
    Against _Orleans_ shall make commotions.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is divided into two parts; the two first Verses foretell the
troubles that were to happen in _Hungaria_, _Bohemia_, and _Navarre_
for Religion sake. The two last ones were fulfilled, when the Prince of
_Condé_, who in his Arms wears the flower de Luce with the Bar, did seize
upon _Orleans_ for the Protestant party.

    English.

    In the _Cyclades_, in _Corinthe_, and _Larisse_,
    In _Sparta_, and all _Peloponesus_,
    There shall be so great a famine and plague by false arts,
    That shall last nine months in _Chersonesus_.

    English.

    In the great Market called of the Liars,
    Which is all _Torrent_ and _Athenian_ Field,
    They shall be surprised by the light Horse,
    Of the _Albanese_, _Mars_ in _Leo_, _Saturn_ in _Aquarius_.

ANNOT.

When _Mars_ shall be in the sign of _Leo_, and _Saturn_ in that of
_Aquarius_, then the Countrey of _Athens_ shall be over-run by light
Horsemen of _Albania_.

    After the seat possessed seventeen years,
    Five shall change in such a space of time;
    After that, one shall be elected at the same time,
    Who shall not be very conformable to the _Romans_.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that when a Pope shall have sat in the Chair, for the
space of 17 years, within the same space of 17 years, five others shall
be elected; and after them another, that shall not be well approved of by
the _Roman_ Clergy, and Nobility. If my memory doth not fail me, this is
come to pass already; but wanting the Popes Chronology, I could not make
it good.


XCIII.

    French.

    English.

    Under the Territory of the round Lunary Globe,
    When _Mercury_ shall be Lord of the ascendant;
    The Island of _Scotland_ shall make a Luminary,
    That shall put the _English_ to an overthrow.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie must of necessity be past; for since the union of both
Kingdom under one King, such a thing hath not happened, nor is it likely
it should be hereafter.


XCIV.

    Of the great Empire, then shall it come to stir,
    The _Ægean_ Sea, with lines of Encumbers,
    Hindering the _Tirrhene_ Sea to roll.

ANNOT.

This is either Mistical or Metaphorical, or I understand it not.


XCVI.

pleaseth.

THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ VI.


I.

    French.

    Autour des Monts _Pyrenees_ grand amas,
    De gent estrange secourir Roy nouveau,
    Pres de _Garonne_ du grand Temple du _Mas_,
    Un _Romain_ Chef le craindra dedans l’Eau.

    English.

    About the _Pyrenean_ Mountains there shall be a great gathering
    Of strange Nations to succour a new King;
    Near _Garonne_ and the great Temple of _Mas_,
    A _Roman_ Captain shall fear him in the Water.

ANNOT.

The _Pyrenean_ Mountains are those that part _Spain_ from _France_;
_Garonne_ is the River that runneth at _Bourdeaux_, it seemeth then, that
upon that River a _Roman_ Captain shall stand in much fear of the new
King before mentioned.


II.

    French.

    En la cinq cens octante plus & moins,
    On attendra le siecle bien estrange,
    En l’an sept cens & trois (cieux en tesmoins),
    Regnes plusieurs un a cinq feront change.

    English.

    In the year five hundred fourscore more or less,
    There shall be a strange Age,
    In the year seven hundred and three (witness Heaven),
    Many Kingdoms, one to five shall be changed.

ANNOT.

What strange age it was in the year 1580. every one may satisfie himself
by History. As for the year 1703. our Author saith there will be great
wonders, chiefly there shall many changes be in Kingdoms, insomuch, that
one shall be divided into five.


III.

    French.

    Fleuve qu’esproune le nouveau nay _Celtique_,
    Sera en grande de l’Empire discorde:
    Le jeune Prince par gent Ecclesiastique,
    Le Sceptre osté Corone de concorde.

    English.

    The River that makes tryal of the new born _Celtick_,
    Shall be at great variance with the Empire,
    The young Prince shall be an Ecclesiastical person,
    And have his Scepter taken off, and the Crown of concord.

ANNOT.

This River is the River of _Rhyne_, because the ancient _French_ when
they had a King newly born, they used to put him upon a Target, to make
him swim upon that River, to try whether by his swimming he was lawfully
begotten or no; the meaning therefore is, that this new born _Celtique_
or _French_ King shall be at variance with the Empire, and that in his
young years the Clergy shall take his Scepter and Crown from him.


IV.

    French.

    Fleuve _Celtique_ changera de Rivage,
    Plus ne tiendra la Cité d’_Agripine_,
    Tout transmué horsmis le viel Language,
    _Saturn_, _Leo_, _Mars_, _Cancer_ en rapine.

    English.

    The River of the Low-Countreys shall change her Shoare,
    It shall touch no more the City of _Agrippina_,
    All shall be transformed, except the old Language,
    _Saturn_, _Leo_, _Mars_, _Cancer_ in _Rapine_.

ANNOT.

This is a strange prediction, if it should prove true, that the _Rhine_
should change its course, and should touch no more the City of _Colen_,
which is here called _Agrippina_; because its name in Latine is _Colonia
Agrippina_, being a Colony of the _Romans_, built by _M. Agrippa_, son
in Law to _Augustus_; others say by _Agrippina_, Mother to the Emperour
_Nero_.

The last Verse signifieth no more than an unfortunate position and Aspect
of the two Planets, _Saturn_ and _Mars_, and of the two Signs, _Leo_ and
_Cancer_.


V.

    French.

    Si grand famine par une pestifere,
    Par pluye longue le long du Pole _Artique_.
    _Samarobryn_ cent lieux de l’Hemisphere,
    Vivront sans loy exempt de politique.

    English.

    So great a famine with a plague,
    Through a long Rain shall come along the _Artick_ Pole,
    _Samarobryn_ a hundred Leagues from the Hemisphere,
    Shall live without Law, exempt from pollicy.

ANNOT.

The two last Verses foretel a great Plague and Famine that shall come
from the North, by the means of the long Rain.

_Samarobryn_ he calls a people, that shall be a hundred Leagues from our
Hemisphere, and shall live without Law and Policy.


VI.

    French.

    Apparoistra vers le septentrion,
    Non loing de _Cancer_ l’estoille cheveluë,
    _Suze_, _Sienne_, _Boëce_, _Eretrion_,
    Mourra de _Rome_ grand, la nuict disperuë.

    English.

    Towards the North shall appear,
    Not far from _Cancer_ a blazing Star,
    _Suza_, _Sienna_, _Boëce_, _Eretrion_,
    There shall die at _Rome_ a great man, the night being past.

ANNOT.

Here he foretelleth the apparition of a Commet that shall be vertical to
the Cities here named, and not far from the Sign of _Cancer_, at which
time a great person shall die at _Rome_, about the dawning of the day.


VII.

    French.

    _Norvege_ & _Dace_, & l’Isle _Britannique_,
    Par les unes freres seront vexées,
    Le chef _Romain_ issu du sang _Gallique_,
    Et les copies aux forests repousées.

    English.

    _Norvegia_, and _Dacia_, and the _Brittish_ Island,
    Shall be vexed by the Brothers united.
    The _Roman_ Captain issued from _French_ blood,
    His Forces shall be beaten back to the Forrest.

ANNOT.

The difficulty lyes in the word _Brothers_, which I suppose to be the
United Provinces. The rest is plain.


VIII.

    French.

    Ceux qui estoient en regne pour scavoir,
    Au Royal change deviendront a pauvris,
    Uns exilez sans appuy, Or navoir,
    Lettréz & lettres ne seront a grand pris.

    English.

    Those that were in esteem for their learning,
    Upon the change of a King shall become poor,
    Some banished, without help, having no Gold,
    Learned and learning shall not be much valued.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is clear enough, and here the Author hath said nothing,
but what doth commonly happen.


IX.

    French.

    Aux Temples Saints seront faits grands scandales,
    Comptez seront peur honneurs & louanges,
    D’un que l’on grave d’Argent, d’Or les Medals,
    La fin sera en tourmens bien estranges.

    English.

    To the holy Temples shall be done great scandals,
    That shall be accounted for honours and praises,
    By one, whose medals are graven in Gold and Silver,
    The end of it shall be in very strange torments.

ANNOT.

Here the Reader must understand that the Author was a _Roman_ Catholick,
and therefore calleth Holy Temples, the Churches of the _Romish_
Religion, which in the beginning of the Civil Wars in _France_, were much
abased by those of the Protestant Religion, then called _Huguenots_,
whose chief was _Henry_ King of _Navarre_, who was the only man amongst
the Protestant party, that could have Money and Medals coined to his
stamp, as being King of _Navarre_. But the last Verse of this Prophecie
proved too true, when upon St. _Bartholomews_ day, the 24 of _August_, in
the year 1572. the general Massacre of the Protestants was made through
_France_.


X.

    French.

    Un peu du temps les Temples des Couleurs,
    De blanc & noir des deux entremislée,
    Rouges & jaunes leur embleront les leurs,
    Sang, terre, peste, faim, feu, eau affollée.

    English.

    Within a little while the Temples of the Colours,
    White and Black shall be intermixt,
    Red and Yellow shall take away their Colours,
    Blood, earth, plague, famine, fire, water shall destroy them.

ANNOT.

By the Temples of the Colours White and Black, I suppose he means that
of Peace, and of War; by the Red and Yellow, may be meant the Empire of
the _Sweads_, who shall be at variance together; and by their long War
shall bring the Plagues here mentioned, as it came to pass in the Wars
of _Germany_, between the Emperour and _Gustavus Adolphus_, King of the
_Sweads_.


XI.

    French.

    Les sept rameaux a trois seront reduits,
    Les plus aisnez seront surprins par morts,
    Fratricider les deux seront seduits,
    Les Conjures en dormant seront morts.

    English.

    The seven branches shall be reduced to three,
    The eldest shall be surprised by death,
    Two shall be said to kill their Brothers,
    The Conspirators shall be killed, being asleep.

ANNOT.

It is apparent, that he speaks of seven Brethren, that shall be reduced
to three, whereof the eldest son shall be surprised by death, and two of
the rest shall be said to have murdered their Brother, the Conspirators
shall afterwards be killed in their sleep.


XII.

    French.

    Dresser Copie pour monter a l’Empire,
    Du _Vatican_ le sang Royal tiendra,
    _Flamens_, _Anglois_, _Espagne_ aspire,
    Contre l’_Italie_ & _France_ contendra.

    English.

    To raise an Army, for to ascend unto the Empire,
    Of the _Vatican_, the Royal blood shall endeavour,
    _Flemings_, _English_, _Spain_ shall aspire,
    And shall contend against _Italy_ and _France_.

ANNOT.

This prediction signifies no more, but that there shall be a great
commotion among the Nations, of _Europe_, concerning the election of
a Pope, which is called here the Empire of the _Vatican_; because the
_Vatican_ is the Popes Palace in _Rome_.


XIII.

    French.

    Un dubieux ne viendra loing du regne,
    La plus grand part le voudra soustenir,
    Un Capitole ne voudra point quil regne,
    Sa grande Chaire ne pourra maintenir.

    English.

    A doubtful man shall not come far from the Reign,
    The greatest part will uphold him,
    A Capitol will not consent that he should Reign,
    His great Chair he shall not be able to maintain.

ANNOT.

What should that doubtful man be, whom our Author doth mention here, is
not easie to be understood; but it seemeth that it shall be some body
pretending to the Popedom, who shall have a great party for himself, and
yet for all that shall be excluded, and not able to keep his Seat; so
that this Prophecie is but the second part of the foregoing; for they
have both a relation together. The Capitol anciently was the Citadel of
_Rome_, and now is the place where the Courts of Judicature meet, called
_Campidoglio_.


XIV.

    French.

    Loing de sa Terre Roy perdra la Bataille,
    Prompt, eschapé poursuivy, suivant pris,
    Ignare pris soubs la dorée maille,
    Soubs feint habit, & l’Ennemy surpris.

    English.

    Far from his Countrey the King shall loose a Battle,
    Nimble, escaped, followed, following, taken,
    Ignorantly taken under the gilded Coat of Mail,
    Under a feigned habit the enemy taken.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was fulfilled in the year 1578. when _Don Sebastian_ King
of _Portugal_, went into _Affrica_, to help and succour _Muley Hamet_,
against _Muley Maluc_, that had expelled him out of the Kingdom of _Fez_
and _Morocco_, and there fought that famous Battle of _Alcasserquibir_,
wherein his whole Army was routed, and himself slain by the _Moores_, and
his body afterwards sold to the King of _Spain_ for a 100000. Crowns.


XV.

    French.

    Dessous la Tombe sera trouvé le Prince,
    Qu’aura le pris par dessus _Nuremberg_:
    L’_Espagnol_ Roy en _Capricorne_ mince,
    Feinct & trahy par le grand _Vutitemberg_.

    English.

    Under the Tomb shall be found the Prince,
    That shall have a price above _Nuremberg_,
    That _Spanish_ King in _Capricorn_ shall be thine,
    Deceived and betrayed by the great _Vutitemberg_.

ANNOT.

We hear of no Prince that had that advantage upon _Nuremberg_, but only
_Gustavus Adolphus_ King of _Sweden_, who took it. The last two Verses
signifie no more, then that the King of _Spain_ shall be wasted at the
time when the Sun is in _Capricorn_.


XVI.

    French.

    Ce que ravy sera du jeune Milve,
    Par les _Normans_ de _France_ & _Picardy_,
    Les noirs du Temple du lieu de _Negrisilve_,
    Feront aux Berge & feu de _Lombardie_.

    English.

    That which shall be taken from the young Kite,
    By the _Normans_ of _France_ and _Picardie_,
    The black ones of the Temple of the place called black Forrest.
    Shall make a Rendezvouz, and a fire in _Lombardie_.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that what the _Normans_ and those of _Picardie_ shall
save from the hand of a young conquering Prince, the same shall be
imployed in building a Temple in the black Forrest, which is that part of
the Forrest of _Arden_, that lies near _Bohemia_, and another part of it
to build a House in _Lombardie_.


XVII.

    French.

    Apres les livres bruslez les Asiniers,
    Contraints seront changer d’habits divers:
    Les _Saturnins_ bruslez par les meusniers,
    Hors la pluspart qui ne sera convers.

    English.

    After the Books shall be burnt, the Asses,
    Shall be compelled several times to change their Cloaths,
    The _Saturnins_ shall be burnt by the Millers,
    Except the greater part, that shall not be discovered.

ANNOT.

This seems to foretell a persecution of ignorant men against the learned,
after which shall happen a confusion amongst the ignorant persons, who
shall be forced to disguise themselves.

The last two Verses seem to be of the same sense, for by the _Saturnins_
I understand studious people, and by the _Millers_ rude and unlearned
persons.


XVIII.

    French.

    Par les Physiques le grand Roy delaissé,
    Par sort non art de l’Ebrieu est en vie,
    Luy & son Genre au Regne hault pousé,
    Grace donnée a gent qui Christ envie.

    English.

    The great King being forsaken by Physicians,
    Shall be kept alive by the Magick and not by the art of a Jew,
    He, and his kindred shall be set at the top of the Kingdom,
    Grace shall be given to a Nation that envieth Christ.

ANNOT.

This in plain words signifieth no more, but that a King shall be
desparately sick and forsaken by his _Physicians_, and shall recover
by the help of a Jew, for which fact those of that Nation shall be
reestablished in his Countrey.


XIX.

    French.

    La vraye flamme engloutira la Dame,
    Que voudra mettre les Innocens a feu,
    Pres de l’aussaut l’exercite s’enflamme,
    Quand dans _Seville_ monstre en Bœuf sera veu.

    English.

    The true flame shall swallow up the Lady,
    That went about to burn the guiltless,
    Before the Assault the Army shall be incouraged,
    When in _Seville_, a Monster like an Ox shall be seen.

ANNOT.

_Seville_ is the chiefest City of _Andalusia_ a Province in _Spain_; the
rest is plain.


XXI.

    French.

    L’Union feinte sera peu de durée,
    Les uns changes reformez la plus part:
    Dans les Vaisseaux sera gent endurée,
    Lors aura _Rome_ un nouveau Leopart.

    English.

    The feigned union shall not last long,
    Some shall be changed, others for the most part reformed,
    In the Ships people shall be pen’d up,
    Then shall _Rome_ have a new Leopard.

ANNOT.

When the things contained in the three first Verses shall come to pass,
then _Rome_ shall have a new Pope, expressed here by the word Leopard
from the variousness, that is, in his Pontifical Garments.


XXI.

    French.

    Quand ceux du Pole _Artique_ unis ensemble,
    En Orient grand effrayeur & crainte,
    Esleu nouveau soustenu le grand tremble,
    _Rodes_, _Bisance_ de sang _Barbare_ taincte.

    English.

    When those of the _Artick_ Pole shall be united together,
    There shall be in the East a great fear and trembling,
    One shall be newly Elected, that shall bear the brunt,
    _Rodes_, _Bisance_, shall be dy’d with _Barbarian_ blood.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth an union between the _Europeans_, or Nations of the
North against the Eastern people, or Turks, and that the Christians shall
make choice of such a General, that shall make the East quake, and get
such Victories, whereby _Rhodes_ and _Constantinople_ shall be dyed with
Turkish blood.


XXII.

    French.

    Dedans la Terre du grand Temple Celique,
    Neveu a _Londres_ par paix feinte meurtry,
    La Barque alors deviendra Schismatique,
    Liberté feinte sera au corne & cry.

    English.

    Within the ground of the great Cœlestial Temple,
    A Nephew at _London_ by a fained peace shall be murdered,
    The Boat at that time shall become Schismatical,
    A fained liberty shall be with _Hue and Cry_.

ANNOT.

I think that by the _great Cœlestial Temple_, he meaneth that of St.
_Paul_, in which, or in the ground about it, shall be murdered a Nephew
by his Uncle, which shall cause great divisions and dissensions in the
City, compared here to a Boat, and that a dissembled or fained liberty
shall be proclaimed.


XXIII.

    French.

    Despit de Roy, numismes descriez,
    Peuples seront esmeus contre leur Roy,
    Paix fait nouveau, Saintes Loix empirées,
    _Rapis_ onc fut en si piteux arroy.

    English.

    The despight of a King, and Coin being brought lower
    People shall rise against their King,
    Peace newly made, Holy Laws being made worse,
    _Rapis_ was never in such a great disorder.

ANNOT.

The first thing here to be observed, is the word _Rapis_, which is the
_Anagramme_ of _Paris_, which he saith was never in such a trouble
before, as it shall be when the people shall rebel against the King for
hatred, and because he shall have put low the price and intrinsical value
of Coin and Money; he foretelleth also that there shall be a new Peace
made, and that the Holy Laws shall be much impaired.


XXIV.

    French.

    _Mars_ & le Sceptre se trouvera conjoint,
    Dessoubs _Cancer_ calamiteuse guerre,
    Un peu apres sera nouveau Roy oingt.
    Qui par long temps pacifiera la Terre.

    English.

    _Mars_ and the Scepter, being conjoyned together,
    Under _Cancer_ shall be a calamitous War,
    A little while after a new King shall be anointed,
    Who for a long time shall pacifie the Earth.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that when the Planet of _Mars_ shall be in
conjunction with the constellation he calleth here the _Scepter_, that
then shall be a very calamitous War. The two last Verses are plain enough
of themselves.


XXV.

    French.

    Par _Mars_ contraire sera la Monarchie,
    Du grand Pescheur en trouble ruineux,
    Jeune, noir, rouge prendra la Hierarchie,
    Les proditeurs iront jour bruineux.

    English.

    By _Mars_ contrary shall the Monarchy
    Of the great Fisherman, be brought into ruinous trouble,
    A young, black, red shall possess himself of the Hierarchy,
    The Traitors shall undertake it on a misty day.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is concerning a certain Pope, signified here by the word
of great _Fisherman_; because in his Seal is graven a Fisherman, and
therefore in all his Bulls and Expeditions, it is always written, _Datum
Romæ sub sigillo piscatoris_: this Pope then it seemeth, shall be brought
to ruine, and another it seemeth shall succeed him, having here three
Epithetes, _viz._ _Young_, _Black_, and _Red_, which signifieth, that
against the common election of Popes, he shall be elected young, and
shall be Black in his complexion, and Red in Cloaths, _viz._ a Cardinal.
_Hierarchy_ is a Greek word, signifying Dominion over the Church. The
last Verse needeth no explication, being plain enough of it self.


XXVI.

    French.

    Quattre ans le siege quelque peu bien tiendra,
    Un surviendra libidineux de vie,
    _Ravenna_, & _Pise_, _Verone_ soustiendront,
    Pour eslever la Croix de Pape envie.

    English.

    Four years he shall keep the Papal seat pretty well,
    Then shall succeed one of a libidinous life,
    _Ravenna_, _Pisa_, shall take _Verona_’s part,
    To raise up the Popes Cross to Life.

ANNOT.

This Prediction seemeth to have not only a relation to the foregoing,
but also a connexion; for the Author still handleth the matter of the
Popedome, and saith, that after that Pope shall have Reigned four years,
there shall succeed one that shall be notorious for debauchedness and
lechery, and that those Towns he mentioneth here (which are all in
_Italy_) shall take the Popes part.


XXVII.

    French.

    Dedans les Isles de cinq fleuves a un,
    Par le croissant du grand _Chyren Selin_,
    Par les bruynes de l’air fureur de l’un,
    Six eschapez, chachez fardeaux de lin.

    English.

    In the Islands from five Rivers to one,
    By the increase of great _Chyren Selin_,
    By the Frost of the Air one shall under furious,
    Six shall escape, hidden within bundles of Flax.

ANNOT.

_Chyren_ by transposition is taken for _Henry_, and _Selin_ for a King
called so; because it is the name of a _Turkish_ Emperour: So that by
this Stanza I suppose he means _Henry_ II. his Master, King of _France_.
The rest is plain.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Le grand _Celtique_ entrera dedans _Rome_,
    Menant amas d’exilez & bannis,
    Le grand Pasteur mettra a mort tout homme,
    Qui pour le Coq estoient aux _Alpes_ unis.

    English.

    The great _Celtique_ shall enter into _Rome_,
    Leading with him a great number of banished men,
    The great Shepheard shall put to death every man,
    That was united for the Cock near the _Alpes_.

ANNOT.

Because this word _Celtique_ is often repeated in this Book, it would not
be amiss to satisfie the Reader of the meaning of it; it is properly the
Nation of the _Flemings_, and some others of the Low-Countreys as far as
the _Mase_ and the _Rhyne_, which anciently were called _Galli Celtæ_. By
_the great Shepheard_, is meant the Pope, and by the _Cock_ is meant the
_French_ Nation. The rest is easie.


XXIX.

    French.

    La Veufve Sainte entendant les nouvelles,
    De ses rameaux mis en perplex & trouble,
    Qui sera duit appaiser les querelles,
    Par son pourchas des Razes sera comble.

    English.

    The holy Widow hearing the News
    Of her Branches put in perplexity or trouble,
    That shall be skilfull in appeasing of quarrels,
    By his purchase shall make a heap of shaven heads.

ANNOT.

By the _holy Widow_, is meant the City of _Rome_, which is called in
_Italian_, _Roma la santa_, because of the blood of so many Martyrs that
hath been shed there, for the maintenance of the Christian Religion,
he calleth it a _Widow_; because at that time there will be no Pope
elected, and there shall be a kind of _interregnum_, as it always happens
when a Pope is dead, until the new one be elected. What he calleth here
Branches, are the Clergy men, and the shaven heads the Priests.


XXX.

    French.

    Par l’apparence de feinte Saincteté,
    Sera trahy aux ennemis le siege,
    Nuit qu’on croioid dormir en seureté,
    Pres de _Brabant_ marcheront ceux de _Liege_.

    English.

    By the appearance of a feigned holiness,
    The siege shall be betrayed to the enemies,
    In a night that every one thought to be secure,
    Near _Brabant_ shall march those of _Liege_.

ANNOT.

_Brabant_ is one of the seventeen Provinces, and _Liege_ is a great City
upon the River of _Maze_. The rest is not difficult.


XXXI.

    French.

    Roy trouvera ce quil desiroit tant,
    Quand le Prelat sera repris a tort,
    Response au Duc le rendra mal content,
    Qui dans _Milan_ mettra plusieurs a mort.

    English.

    A King shall find what he so much longed for,
    When a Prelate shall be censured wrongfully,
    An answer to the Duke will make him discontented,
    Who in _Milan_ shall put many to death.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is too indefinite, to admit of a particular sense; for
there be so many Prelates, so many Kings, so many Dukes, that it is not
easie to fix upon any particular one, and therefore we must leave this
Stanza in _Democritus_’s Well.


XXXII.

    French.

    Par trahison de verges a mort battu,
    Puis surmonté sera par son desordre,
    Conseil frivole au grand captif sentu,
    Nez par fureur quand _Berich_ viendra mordre.

    English.

    By Treason one shall be beaten with rods to death,
    Then the Traitor shall be overcome by his disorder,
    The great Prisoner shall try a frivilous Counsel,
    When _Berich_ shall bite anothers nose through anger.

ANNOT.

The words are so plain, that every one may make his own interpretation of
them.


XXXIII.

    French.

    Sa main derniere par _Alus_ sanguinaire,
    Ne le pourra par la Mer garentir,
    Entre deux fleuves craindra main militaire,
    Le noir l’Ireux le fera repentir.

    English.

    His last hand bloody through _Alus_,
    Shall not save him by Sea,
    Between two Rivers he shall fear the military hand,
    The black and Cholerick one shall make him repent.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to be concerning a bloody man, that had killed one _Alus_,
and sought to save himself by Sea; but was taken between two Rivers, and
put to death by the command of one that was a black and Cholerick man.


XXXIV.

    French.

    De feu volant la machination,
    Viendra troubler le Chef des Assiegez,
    Dedans sera telle sedition,
    Qu’en desespoir seront les profligez.

    English.

    The device of flying fire
    Shall trouble so much the Captain of the Besieged,
    And within shall be such mutiny,
    That the Besieged shall be in despair.

ANNOT.

It is a Fort or Town besieged by an Enemy, who shall torment the besieged
so much with Bombs and Granadoes, and other flying fire, that they shall
despair to escape.


XXXV.

    French.

    Pres de _Rion_ & proche _Blanchelaine_,
    _Aries_, _Taurus_, _Cancer_, _Leo_, _La Vierge_,
    _Mars_, _Jupiter_, le _Sol_ ardra grand plaine,
    Bois & Citez, Lettres cachez au Cierge.

    English.

    Near _Rion_ going to _Blanchelaine_,
    _Aries_, _Taurus_, _Cancer_, _Leo_, _Virgo_,
    _Mars_, _Jupiter_, _Sol_ shall burn a great Plain,
    Woods and Cities, Letters hidden in a wax Candle.

ANNOT.

The meaning of it is, that when by the virtues and meetings of the said
Constellations, a great plain shall be burnt by _Rion_ (which is a City
in _Auvergne_) that then Letters shall be found hidden in a wax Candle.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Ne bien ne mal par bataille terrestre,
    Ne parviendra au confins de perouse,
    Rebeller pise, _Florence_ voir mal estre,
    Roy nuit blessé sur mulet a noire house.

    English.

    Neither good nor evil by a Land-fight,
    Shall reach to the Borders of _Perusa_,
    _Pisa_ shall rebel, _Florence_ shall be in an ill case,
    A King being upon his Mule shall be wounded in the night time.

ANNOT.

_Perusa_, _Pisa_, and _Florence_ are Cities in Italy; the rest is plain.


XXXVII.

    French.

    L’œuvre ancienne se parachevera,
    Du toit cherra sur le grand mal ruine,
    Innocent fait, mort on accusera,
    Nocent caché taillis a bruine.

    English.

    The ancient work shall be finished,
    From the tiling shall fall upon the great one an evil ruine,
    The innocent declared to be so, shall be accused after his death,
    The guilty shall be hidden in a wood in a misty weather.

ANNOT.

By the first Verse is understood an ancient building, which shall be
finished and brought to perfection, I suppose it to be the _Louvere_,
which hath been a building in the Reign of seven Kings. But before it be
throughly finished, some ruine shall fall upon a great man and kill him;
one declared innocent of the fact shall be accused of it after his death,
and he that shall be guilty of it shall escape by hiding himself in a
Wood in misty weather.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    Aux profligez de Paix les ennemis,
    Apres avoir l’_Italie_ superée,
    Noir sanguinaire, rouge sera commis,
    Feu, sang verser, eau de sang colorée.

    English.

    To the vanquished the enemies of peace,
    After they shall have overcome _Italy_,
    A bloody black one shall be committed,
    Fire and blood shall be powerd, and water coloured with blood.

ANNOT.

A bloody black man shall be put into the hands of the vanquished, by
those that were enemies to peace, after they have conquered _Italy_,
whence shall proceed fire and blood, and water coloured with blood.


XXXIX.

    French.

    L’Enfant du Regne par Paternelle prinse,
    Expolier sera pour delivrer,
    Aupres du Lac _Trasym_ en la Tour prinse,
    La troupe hostage pour trop fort s’enyvrer.

    English.

    The Child of the Kingdom, through his Fathers imprisonement,
    Shall be deprived of his Kingdom for the delivering of his father,
    Near the Lake _Trasymene_ shall be taken in a Tower,
    The troop that was in Hostage, being drunk.

ANNOT.

The Lake _Trasymene_ in _Italy_, is that near which _Annibal_ got that
famous Battle upon the _Romans_. The rest is as plain as the words can
bear.


XL.

    French.

    Grand de _Mogonce_ pour grande soif esteindre,
    Sera privé de sa grand dignité,
    Ceux de _Cologne_ si fort le viendront plaindre,
    Que le grand _Groppe_ au _Rhin_ sera jetté.

    English.

    The great one of _Ments_ for to quench a great thirst,
    Shall be deprived of his high dignity,
    Those of _Colen_ shall bemoan him so much.
    That the great _Groppe_ shall be thrown into the _Rhine_.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth the fall of an Archbishop of _Ments_, in Latine
_Moguntia_, who is the first Ecclesiastical Elector, and shall be
deprived of his dignity by a covetous and powerful Prince to satisfie
his covetousness, at which those of _Colen_ his neighbours shall be so
incensed, that they shall throw that covetous person into the _Rhine_.


XLI.

    French.

    Les second Chef du Regne _Dannemark_,
    Par ceux de _Frize_ & l’Isle _Britannique_,
    Fera despendre plus de cent mille mark,
    Vain exploiter voiage en _Italique_.

    English.

    The second head of the Kingdom of _Dannemark_,
    By those of _Friezeland_, and the _Brittish_ Island,
    Shall cause to be spent above 100000. Mark,
    Vainly endeavouring a journey into _Italy_.

ANNOT.

This signifieth onely a conjunction of the _Dutch_, _Danish_, and
_English_ Forces, to attempt something in _Italy_, which shall prove
fruitless, and cost a great deal of Money.


XLII.

    French.

    A l’_Ogmion_ sera laissé le Regne,
    Du grand _Selin_, qui plus fera de fait,
    Par l’_Italie_ estendra son enseigne,
    Regira par prudent contrefait.

    English.

    Unto l’_Ogmion_ shall be left the Kingdom,
    Of great _Selyn_, who shall do more then the rest,
    Through _Italy_ he shall spread his Ensigns,
    He shall govern by a prudent dissimulation.

ANNOT.

We have said before, that when ever the Author speaks of _Ognion_, he
meaneth the King of _France_, the meaning therefore of this whole Stanza
is, that _Henry_ the II. Son to _Francis_ the I. whom he calls here great
_Selin_, shall do more in _Italy_ then his Predecessors had done, which
proved true, and he governed his Kingdom with a prudent dissimulation.


XLIII.

    French.

    Long temps sera sans estre habitée,
    Ou _Siene_ & _Marne_ autour vient arrouser,
    De la _Thamise_ & Martiaux tentée,
    Deceus les gardes en evidant repousser.

    English.

    A great while shall be unhabited,
    Where _Seine_, and _Marne_ comes to water about,
    Being attempted by the _Thames_ and Martial people,
    The Guards deceived in thinking to resist.

ANNOT.

By the two first Verses, he meaneth without doubt the City of _Paris_,
for it is watered by those two Rivers the _Seine_ and _Marne_, that joyn
together at the head of it, but how this City should become unhabited is
the great question, and chiefly by the means here alledged, _viz._ of
the _English_ signified by the _Thames_, and other Martial people, _the
Guards deceived in thinking to repulse_ the enemy.


XLIV.

    French.

    De nuict par _Nantes_ l’Iris apparoistra,
    Des Arcs Marins susciteront la pluye:
    _Arabique_ Goulfre grand classe parfondra,
    Un Monstre en _Saxe_ naistre d’Ours & Truye.

    English.

    By night in _Nantes_ the Rain-bow shall appear,
    Sea Rain-bows shall cause Rain;
    The _Arabian_ Gulf shall drownd a great Fleet,
    A Monster shall be in _Saxony_ from a Bear and a Sow.

ANNOT.

_Nantes_ is a City in _France_, _Iris_ is the Rainbow, _Saxony_ is a
Province in _Germany_; the rest is plain.


XLV.

    French.

    Le Governeur du Regne bien scavent,
    Ne consentir voulant au faict Royal:
    Medite classe par le contraire vent,
    Le remettra a son plus desloyal.

    English.

    The Governour of the Kingdom being learned,
    Shall not consent to the Kings will:
    He shall intend to set out a Fleet by a contrary Wind,
    Which he shall put into the hands of the most disloyal.

ANNOT.

This signifies that the Governour or Vice-Roy of a Kingdom shall refuse
to consent to his Kings Deeds; the rest needeth no interpretation.


XLVI.

    French.

    Unjuste sera en exil Anvoyé,
    Par pestilance aux confins de non seggle,
    Response au rouge le fera desvoye,
    Roy retirant a la Rane & a l’Aigle.

    English.

    A just person shall be banished,
    By plague to the Borders of Non seggle,
    The answer to the red one shall make him deviate,
    Retiring himself to the Frog and the Eagle.

ANNOT.

Some parties of the Popes side, shall subdue those bordering upon
_Danubius_, and drive away the Priests, turn all things topse-turvy, make

ANNOT.

It is the strange wickedness of a woman, that shall incestuously be got
with Child by her Son in Law, and when she is delivered, shall kill her
Child, and throw him into a Well; a while after the water beginning to
corrupt, a search shall be made of the cause, and then the Childs Bones

wicked woman, he saith, that the Planet of _Mars_ shall be the ascendant
in her Horoscope.

The words of this prediction are plain and easie, and signifie no more

by a Miracle) the King and thirty of the spectators shall be preserved.

ANNOT.

The great _Celtique_ Prelate, was the Cardinal of _Lorrain_, Brother to

By fruitfull _Brittain_, is understood the province of that name in
_France_, which by the means of the Duke of _Mercure_, her Governour
shall be unsuspected by the King.

ANNOT.

_Chelme_ is a _German_ word, that signifies a Rogue. By _Marnegro_, is
meant the Black Sea, or _Nigropont_. By pulling a Spunge, I suppose the
great quantity of Spunges that stick to the Rocks in that Sea.

_Tripolis_, _Chios_, and _Trapezon_, are places in the _Turkish_
Dominions.

    So that liberty shall be restored to the Isles and _Sienne_.

ANNOT.

Here is nothing difficult but the word _Selene_, which is the Moon from
the Greek σεληνη.

The meaning is, that at such a time when the Sun is Ecclipsed by the
Moon, _Sienna_ and the Islands about it shall be at liberty.

    English.

    Both the flowers shall be lost too late,
    Against the Law the Serpent will do nothing,
    The forces of the Leaguers by gallops shall be confounded,
    _Savone_, _Albingue_, by _Monech_ shall suffer great pain.

ANNOT.

The two first verses are too mistical for me; the third signifieth, that
by gallops; that is, by Troops of Horses, the Leaguers, _viz._ those that
held the party of the League, shall be routed by the Kings Cavalry. The
fourth, that _Savone_ and _Albingue_, two Towns of the _Genoeses_, shall
be put to much trouble by those of _Monech_ and _Monaco_, another Town
near them, belonging to the Prince of _Monaco_, a _Genoese_ of the house
of _Grimald_.

    La Dame seule au Regne demurée,
    L’unique esteint premier au lict d’honneur,
    Sept ans sera de douleur epleurée,
    Puis longue vie au regne par bonheur.

    English.

    The Lady shall be left to reign alone,
    The only one being extinguished, first in the Bed of Honour,
    Seven years she shall weep for grief,
    After that she shall live long in the Reign by good luck.

ANNOT.

The second and fourth Verses perswade me, that this Stanza came to pass
in the time of _Catharine_ of _Medicis_, wife to _Henry_ II. because she
lived long, and the King died in the bed of Honour, and thus he saith,
_that she was left to Reign alone_; because her four Sons were all little
ones, so that she alone was Regent in _France_.

The second Verse saith, _The holy one being extinguished, first, in the
Bed of Honour_.

By this word _the only one_, the Author meaneth not the only Son, but the
only one living, such as _Henry_ II. was to her, _who was extinguished in
the Bed of Honour_, and died of the wound he received at Tilting.

The third Verse saith, that after his death, her mourning lasted seven
years, that is, from the first of _August_ 1559. to the first of _August_
1566. because that all those 16 Months that _Francis_ II. she had
nothing but continual sorrow, by the conspiracy of _Amboise_, the secret
practises of the King of _Navarre_, and Prince of _Condé_ his Brother,
by the insurrection of the Protestants, when _Charles_ IX. visited his
Kingdom, _Anno_ 1556. after which she put off her mourning.

The fourth Verse signifieth, that she should be long lived; for she lived
above 60 years, He saith also, that she was Regent by great luck, that
is, great luck for her self, but not for the Kingdom, for it was most
unhappy in her time.

    No agreement shall be kept,
    All those that shall admit of it deal falsly,
    There shall be protestations made by Land and Sea,
    _Barcelone_ shall take a Fleet by craft.

ANNOT.

This is a description of the sad and calamitous estate of _France_,
in the time of the Civil wars, when no agreement could be kept on the
_Roman_ Catholicks side, witness the several Peaces that were made and
broken, the Massacre of _Vassa_, and that infamous perfidy committed by
them on St. _Bartholomews_ day, being the 24 of _August_, _Anno_ 1572.

    Between the Gray and sad Gray shall be half open War,
    By night they shall be assaulted and plundered,
    The sad Gray being taken, shall be put in Custody,
    His Temple shall be open, two shall be put in the Grate.

ANNOT.

This Stanza affordeth us a commical History, which is, that about the
year 1601. when there sprang up in _France_ a Kind of Friers, who bosted
themselves to be the true observers of the Rule of St. _Francis_, and
that the Cordeliers and Capushines did not keep it so exactly, but they
had need of a great reformation; the King _Henry_ IV. granted them a
Convent at _Beaufort_, and upon his example many other places desired
them, they went to possess themselves of the house of _la Blamet_, near
_Angiers_; but the Cordeliers being loath to be dispossessed by these
new comers, called _Recollets_, did besiege them by main force, broke
open the Gates, scaled the Walls, the besieged did not defend themselves
by words or exorcismes, but with good Stones and Flints, so that if the
people had not come, the fray would not have ended without murder, some
of them were put in Prison, others kept in Custody: this is the meaning
of the Author, when he saith, _There will be half an open War between the
Gray and the sad Gray_; for the Cordeliers have a Gray habit, and the
Recollets a sad Gray.

    At the foundation of a new sect,
    The Bones of the great _Roman_ shall be found,
    The Sepulchre shall appear covered with Marble,
    The Earth shall quake in _April_, they shall be ill buried.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that when they shall go about to make a foundation of a
house, for a new Sect of Friers; they shall find the bones of a famous
_Roman_ in a Marble Sepulchre, and that in _April_ the Earth shall quake,
whereby many shall be swallowed up.

    To the great Empire quite another shall come,
    Being farther from goodness and happiness,
    Governed by one of base parentage,
    The Kingdom shall fall, a great unhappiness.

    Lors que Soldats fureur seditieuse,
    Contre leur Chef seront denuit fer livre,

    Lors vexer _Rome_ & principaux seduire.

    English.

    When the seditious fury of the Souldiers,
    Against their Chief shall make the Iron shine by night,
    The enemy d’_Albe_ shall by a furious hand,
    Then vex _Rome_, and seduce the principal one.

ANNOT.

The Lord _de Thou_ doth judiciously observe, that the Pope being
unacquainted with things belonging to War, as to Money, Victuals, and
Ammunition, was easily persuaded by Cardinal _Caraffa_ to make war
against _Spain_, for without being provided of all these things, he put
his Armies into the Field, _nec satis perpendens quám a pecuniâ, milite
ac cæteris rebus ad bellum necessariis imparatus intempestive arma
sumeret_.

In the 15. Book of his History: the Duke of _Vrbin_ had commission to
raise 6000. Foot and 300. Horses in the Dukedom of _Spoleto_, and in
_Mark_ of _Ancona_. _John Caraffe_ the Popes Nephew was made General of
the Army, and being but Earl of _Mortor_, was Created Duke of _Palliano_,
by the confiscation of the goods of _Mark Antony Colonna_. _Camillo
Ursini_ was made General of the Forces in _Rome_, and in the Territory
thereof; _Blasius_ of _Monluc_, the _Mars_ of his time, and by birth a
_Gascon_, was sent by the King to help (with his advice and courage) the
_Romans_, who are always fitter for the Breviary, then for the Sword.

Besides these Forces raised within the Church Dominions, _Charles
Caraffa_ gathered all the Bandittes of _Naples_ and _Florence_, and
raised some Regiments of _Switzers_ that came to succour the Pope.

With these Troops the Pope seized upon the most important places and
persons belonging to the _Spanish_ party, as the _Coloneses_ and the
_Vitelly_.

These asked succours of the Emperour _Charles_ the V. who presently
commanded _Ferdinand_ of _Toledo_ Duke of _Alba_ to succour them. He was
then tasked in the _Piemont_ and _Milanes_, to resist the _French_ that
were then under the conduct of the Marshal of _Brissac_.

To conclude his design the better, he wrote many Letters to the Pope and
the Colledge of Cardinals, full of respect and submission, desiring them
to moderate their passion against the _Spanish_ party, but the Pope being
angry by several reports, answered him, complaining of many things, which
made the Duke resolve to the war, and to be there in person.

He took his occasion as a prudent Captain, when the news was brought
to him that the Popes Forces were in mutiny against their General for
want of pay, and made a great tumult in the night, hearing that he was
approaching with a great train of Artillery. _Bzovius_ saith, that the
Earl of _Montor_ regarded more his profit then the Popes Interest, and
kept back a great part of the money that was to pay the Souldiers, whence
proceeded this tumult, which helped much the Duke of _Alva_’s business.

This is the explanation of the two first Verses of this Stanza,
concerning the mutiny of the Souldiers that were in the Popes service,
during which mutiny the enemy d’_Alba_ did not fail to vex Rome; this
word the enemy d’_Alba_ doth not signifie the enemy of the Duke of
_Alba_, as if one should say in Latine _Hostis Albanus_. He did then vex
_Rome_; for in a short time he took _Ponte Corvino_, _Frusino Anagnia_,
_Marino_, _Lavaci_, _Prœneste_, _Tivoli_, _Ostia_, _Neptuno_, _Alba
Vico-Varro_, _Monte Fortino_, and almost all the places of the _Roman_
Territory.

This did streighten _Rome_ so much, that the General _Camillo Ursini_
made several Trenches within the Walls of _Rome_, instead of preserving
the outworks, as _Montluc_ would have persuaded him to do; the alarums
were so great at _Rome_, that _Montluc_ was fain to encourage the
_Romans_, and to make a Warlike Speech to them, which is inserted in his
Works.

Moreover, the same Duke began to seduce the Principals of _Rome_ by his
friends that he had in it, but particularly by the cheat that he put
upon the Pope; for his design being to prevent the _French_ Forces, and
to surprize the Pope, he resolved to go streight to _Rome_, and to bring
his design the better to pass, he sent _Pyrrhus Coffrede_ to the Pope,
to see if there was any way of agreement, to the end that upon this
proposition the Pope should mistrust nothing. In the mean time the Duke
of _Alba_ was coming near _Rome_, at which the Pope was so angry, that he
put this Embassadour in Prison, where he was kept till the conclusion of
the Peace; in this sort were the principal men of _Rome_ seduced, having
no thought of the _Spaniards_ approaches, this is the relation of the
Lord _de Thou_, _Lib._ 16.


LXIX.

    French.

    La grand pitie sera sans long tarder,
    Ceux qui donnoient seront contraints de prendre
    Nuds affamez, de froid, soif, soy bander,
    Passer les Monts en faisant grand esclandre.

    English.

    What a great pitty will it be e’re-long,
    Those that did give shall be constrained to receive,
    Naked, famished with cold, thirst, to mutiny,
    To go over the Mountains making great disorders.

ANNOT.

The words of the first Verse, _before it be long_, is the Key of the
Stanza, because we infer from thence it was shortly to happen, as in
truth it did at the latter end of the year 1556. when the Duke of _Guise_
came into _Piemont_ to joyn with the Marshal of _Brissac_. Then the
troops of the _Marshal_ seeing those of the Duke better paid then they
were, forsook the Marshal, the History saith there was above 1500. of
them, and that the Marshal paid the Souldiers of his own money to stay
them.

The great pitty was, when he had no more to give, he was compelled by the
Kings order it self, and against his own inclination to raise some moneys
upon the Countreys. Secondly, to take some Towns and give the plunder to
the Souldiers. Thirdly, to permit the Souldiers to pillage the Countrey.

The Author was willing to foretell this, because there was never a man
more strict in keeping the Martial discipline, then this General was.

The Marshal of _Brissac_ being thus abused, some of his troops forsook
him to follow the Duke of _Guise_, being for the most part naked and
starved with cold, hunger and thirst, which makes the Author to specifie
_hunger, cold and thirst_; want having compelled them to disband, they
went over the Mountains, not of _Piemont_, but the _Apennines_ of
_Montserrat_, and whatsoever thing they found was a Fish for their Net.


LXX.

    French.

    Un Chef du Monde le grand _Cheiren_ sera,

    English.

    A Chief of the World the great _Cheiren_ shall be,
    Moreover, beloved afterwards, feared, dreaded,
    His fame and praise shall go beyond the Heavens,
    And shall be contented with the only title of Victor.

ANNOT.

We have said already before, that the Author by the word _Cheyren_
meaneth _Henry_ the II. his Master, by transposition of Letters, who as
he saith was contented with the bare title of Victorieux, when he had
undertaken the protection of the _German_ Princes against the Emperour
_Charles_ the V.


LXXI.

    French.

    Quand on viendra le grand Roy parenter,
    Avant quil ait du tout l’Ame rendue,

    English.

    When they shall come to celebrate the obsequies of the great King,
    A day before he be quite dead,
    He shall be seen presently to be allyed
    With Eagles, Lions, Crosses, Crowns of Rüe.

ANNOT.

In the general Peace made _Anno_ 1559. two Marriages were concluded, one
of _Elizabeth_ of _France_, daughter to _Henry_ II. King of _France_,
with _Philip_ II. King of _Spain_, which was Celebrated at _Paris_ with
an extraordinary magnificence, in the presence of the Duke of _Alba_,
the Prince of _Orenge_, and the Earl of _Egmont_, who came to fetch the
Princess.

In the Celebrating of these Nuptials happened the unfortunate death of
_Henry_ II. This brought such a sadness to the Court, that the second
match which was between _Margaret_ of _France_, Daughter to _Francis_ I.
and the Duke of _Savoy_ was Celebrated without solemnity.

We must add to this, that the Duke weareth in his Coat of Arms some
Eagles, some Lions, some Crosses, and a Crown of Rue; by this, we
understand this Stanza, which saith, that the King being mortally
wounded, every one was preparing himself to render him the last duties,
which the Author calleth to _Parante_, from the Latine word _Parentare_,
which signifieth to Celebrate the Funeral duties of a man. Thus the
second Verse saith, _before the day that he yieldeth up his Soul_,
in hast was the Marriage Celebrated, between the Lady _Margaret_ of
_France_, and the Duke of _Savoy_, who beareth for his Arms some Eagles,
some Lions, some Crosses, and a Crown of Rue.

    By a faigned fury of Divine inspiration,
    The wife of the great one shall be ravished,
    Judges willing to condemn such a Doctrine,
    A Victimo shall be sacrificed to the ignorant people.

ANNOT.

Of this fact and others as bad, have been seen strange examples, formerly
done by those called _Enthousiastes_, who have committed horrible
villanies, under pretence of divine inspiration, some commiting Incests,
others rapes, others murders, as may be seen at large in the History of
_John de Leiden_, and other desperate Anabaptists, too tedious to be
inserted here; I shall only relate here a little remarkable History, in
confirmation of this, to discover the Wiles of the spirits of error,
transformed into an Angel of Light.

The 7 day of _February_ 1526. two Brothers, _Thomas_ and _Leonard
Schyker_, living near the Town of St. _Gal_ in _Switzerland_, did
assemble together with some other Anabaptists, in their fathers house,
where they passed the most part of the night in discourses, making
of faces, and relating of Visions, which every one said he had seen.
The next day, upon break of day; _Thomas_ did lay hold on his Brother
_Leonard_, and dragged him in the middle of the company, bid him kneel
in the presence of his Father and Mother, and of all the rest there
present, and as all the rest of the Company bid him take heed to do any
thing amiss; he answered, that there was no need to fear, and that in
this business, nothing could be done against the Will of the Father;
thereupon he drew his Sword, and cut off the head of his Brother, who
was on his knees, all besotted before this murderer. All the rest being
astonished, and besides their wits for this furious blow, and lamenting
the dead, _Thomas_ ran towards the Town with a fearful Countinance,
as a Phanatick besides himself, without Shooes; and having no Cloaths
but his Shirt and Breeches. At that time the Burg-master of St. _Gal_
was _Joachim Vadian_, a wise and learned person, before whom the said
_Thomas_ stood, crying aloud with a fearful Countenance, that the day of
Judgment was near; saying besides, that strange things had come to pass,
(without telling what) that the will of his Father was done for his part.
The Burg-master after he had reprehended him very much for his madness,
and insolent carriage, commanded a Cloak to be put upon him, and to lead
him home softly back again. But in the mean time, news was brought of his
detestable murder, whereupon he was apprehended, examined, convicted,
and executed. The like hath been done many times for Rapes and Incests:
What is particular here, is, that our Author saith, that the Judges being
willing to punish such Villanies, yet that unhappy accident shall fall,
that an innocent person shall be put to death (belike) instead of the
guilty, to please the people.

    En Cité grande en moyne & artisan,
    Pres de la porte logez & aux murailles,
    Contre modene secret, Cave disant,
    Trahis pour faire sous couleur d’espousailles.

    English.

    In a great City a Monk and an Artificer,
    Dwelling near the Gate, and the Walls,
    Near an old woman, ’tis a secret saying Cave,
    A Treason shall be plotted under pretence of a Marriage.

ANNOT.

_Paradin_ maketh mention, that in the year 1552. a Monk deceived the
Marshal of _Brissac_, making him believe that he would put him in
possession of the Town of _Quizres_, if he would give him so much for
reward. The Marshal used all the Caution possible, not to be deceived
by that Imposter, who took Money on both sides, _viz._ the _French_ and
the _Spaniards_; nevertheless the Monk plaid the Knave with him, and the
undertakings proved prejudicial to the _French_, though not considerably
by reason of the precaution of the said Marshal.

The same Author writes, that in the year 1555. the 17 of _August_,
the _Spaniard_ had designed to retake _Cazal_, the same way that the
_French_ had surprised it. First, they had got a Widow in the Town, who
received the undertakers in her house, which was near the Gate, and the
Wall. Secondly there was a Marriage to be made between two persons of
quality, where great Cheer and rejoycings were to be. Thirdly they got
a woman that carryed Herbs to sell in the Town, and under the Herbs the
Letters were hidden. The Author says likewise, that there was a Monk and
a Tradesman, that lodged at this Widows house, those two actors in this
business, _viz._ the Monk said Tradesman, ane secretly to the woman that
sold Herbs, _Cave_, which signifies take heed, they said these words
_secretly near Matrone_, that is, they whisperd in her ear _Cave_. Their
design was to betray the Town, under pretence of a Marriage, but it did
not succeed; because the Letters in the womans Basket were intercepted,
the Vulgar impression hath a fault in the third Verse, where there is
Modene instead of Matrone, and another in the fourth Verse, when instead
of Treason, they have put for betrayed. The History obligeth us to
correct it, as we have done.


LXXIV.

    French.

    Le dechassé au regne tournera,
    Ses ennemis trouvez des conjurez,
    Plus que jamais son temps triomphera,
    Trois & septante a mort trop asseurez.

    English.

    The expelled shall come again to the Kingdom,
    Her enemies shall be found to be the Conspirators,
    More than ever his time shall triumph,
    Three and seventy appointed for death.

ANNOT.

This is a clear and express prediction of the happy restauration of his
sacred Majesty, and our dread Sovereign _Charles_ II. now Reigning,
who after a long exile is come again to enjoy his own Kingdom, and
to flourish more than ever he did before, by these seventy appointed
to death, are meant the Judges and murderers of his Father, who with
some few others of the same gang made about that number, and some of
which have payed their shot by the hand of publick Justice, others have
prevented their shame by dying before hand, others have been their own
Executioners, and those that remain, lead a life worse then death it
self; so true it is that vengeance dances the round.

    English.

    The great Pilot shall be sent for by the King,
    To leave the Fleet, and be preferred to a higher place,
    Seven years after he shall be countermanded,
    A _Barbarian_ Army shall put _Venice_ to a fright.

ANNOT.

This needeth no further explanation.


LXXVI.

    French.

    La Cité antique d’_Antenorée_ forge,
    Plus ne pouvant le Tyran supporter,
    Le manche feint au Temple couper gorge,
    Les siens le peuple a mort viendra bouter.

    English.

    The ancient City founded by _Antenor_,
    Being not able to bear the Tyrant any longer,
    With a fained haft, in the Church cut a throat,
    The people will come to put his servants to death.

ANNOT.

The City founded by _Antenor_ (who was Companion and came into _Italy_
with _Æneas_) is _Padua_, a University of the _Venetians_, of which it is
said here, that being no longer able to bear a Tyrant, the said Tyrant
shall be murdered in the Church with a knife hidden in a haft, and all
his Men and Servants killed by the people of the Town.


LXXVII.

    French.

    Par la victoire du deceu fraudulente,
    Deux classes une, la revolte _Germaine_,

    English.

    By the deceitful victory of the deceived,
    One of the two Fleets shall revolt to the _Germans_,
    The Chief and his Son murdered in their Tent,
    _Florence_, _Imole_ persecuted in _Romania_.

ANNOT.

The three first Verses are plain. _Florence_ and _Imole_ are two Cities
of _Italy_, seated in the Province of _Romania_.


LXXVIII.

    French.

    Crier victoire du grand _Selin_ croissant,
    Par les _Romains_ sera l’Aigle clamé,
    _Ticin_, _Milan_, & _Gennesny_ consent
    Puis par eux mesmes _Basil_ grand reclamé.

    English.

    They shall cry up the victory of the great _Selins_ half Moon,
    By the _Romans_ the Eagle shall be claimed,
    _Ticin_, _Milan_ and _Genoa_, consent not,
    Then by themselves the great _Basil_ shall be claimed.

ANNOT.

The first Verse foretelleth some conquests of the _Turks_, whose Arms
is the half Moon. The second Verse signifies, the _Romans_ shall move
the Emperour to succour them, which is the Eagle. _Ticin_, _Milan_ and
_Genoa_ shall refuse to give help, and afterwards they shall call the
great _Basil_ (which in Greek signifies the great King, from βασίλευς) to
their help.


LXXIX.

    French.

    Pres de _Tesin_ les habitants de _Logre_,
    _Garonne_ & _Saone_, _Seine_, _Tar_, & _Gironde_:

    English.

    Near the _Tesin_ the Inhabitants of _Logre_,
    _Garonne_ and _Saone_, _Seine_, _Tar_ and _Gironde_,
    Shall erect a promontory beyond the Mountains,
    A Battle shall be fought, the _Po_ shall be passed over, some
      shall be drowned in it.

ANNOT.

_Tesin_ is the River that passeth by _Milan_. _Garonne_, _Saone_,
_Seine_, _Tar_, and _Gironde_ are Rivers of _France_. _Po_ is the
greatest River of _Italy_.


LXXX.

    French.

    De _Fez_ le Regne parviendra a ceux d’_Europe_,
    Feu leur Cité, & Lame tranchera,
    Le grand d’_Asie_ Terre & Mer a grand troupe,
    Que bleux, pars, Croix a mort dechassera.

    English.

    The Kingdom of _Fez_ shall come to those of _Europe_,
    Fire and Sword shall destroy their City,
    The great one of _Asia_ by Land and Sea with a great troop,
    So that blews, greens, Crosses to death he shall drive.

ANNOT.

This is strange Prophecy if it prove true, _viz._ that the Kingdom of
_Fez_ (which is in _Africa_) shall be taken by those of _Europe_, and the
Town put to Fire and Sword, after which the great one of _Asia_ (meaning
the great Turk) shall come by Land and by Sea with an innumerable Army,
and shall drive and destroy all before him.

    English.

    Tears, cryes and complaints, howlings, fear,
    An inhumane heart, cruel, black, astonished,
    _Leman_, the Islands the great ones of _Genoa_,
    Shall spill blood, the Bell shall ring out, no mercy shall be given.

ANNOT.

This foretels bloody Wars only, and needs no interpretation.


LXXXII.

    French.

    Par les Deserts de lieu libre & farouche,
    Viendra errer Neveu du grand Pontife,
    Assomme a sept avec lourde souche,
    Par ceux qu’apres occuperont le _Scyphe_.

    English.

    Through the Deserts of a free and ragged place,
    The Nephew of the Pope shall come to wander,
    Knockt in the head by seven with a heavy Club,
    By those who after shall obtain the _Scyphe_.

ANNOT.

This signifies that the Nephew of a Pope shall be driven away, and shall
wander in a desert place, where he shall be knockt in the head by seven
men, one of which shall afterwards enjoy the Papacy; for _Scyphe_ is a
Latine word, signifying a Cup or Chalue, such as the _Romish_ Priests say
Mass with, and take the Sacrament.


LXXXIII.

    French.

    Celuy qu’aura tant d’honneurs & caresses,
    A son entrée en la Gaule _Belgique_,
    Un temps apres sera tant de rudesses,
    Et sera contre a la fleur tant bellique.

    English.

    He that shall have had so many honours and welcoms,
    At his going into _Flanders_,
    A while after shall commit so many rudenesses,
    And shall be against the warlike flower.

ANNOT.

This is positively concerning the Duke of _Alencon_, Brother to _Henry_
III. King of _France_, who having been sent for by the States of the
Low-Countreys, and received with much honour to be their General and
Governour against the _Spaniard_, did most unworthily break his trust,
and being come to _Antwerp_, he was so ravished with the beauty and
riches of the Town, that he seized upon it for himself, but was beaten
out by the Citizens, and most of his men killed.

The fourth Verse saith. _He shall be against the warlike flower_; that
is, his action shall be against Military Honour, and common practice of
Honourable Souldiers.


LXXXIV.

    French.

    Celuy qu’en _Sparte_ _Claude_ ne veut regner,
    Il fera tant par voye seductive,
    Que du court, long, le sera arraigner,
    Que contre Roy fera sa perspective.

    English.

    He that _Claudius_ will not have to reign in _Sparta_,
    The same shall do so much by a deceitful way,
    That he shall cause him to be arraigned short and long,
    As if he had made his prospect upon the King.

ANNOT.

I believe the words of _Claudius_ and _Sparta_ here are Metaphorical, and
the Author was unwilling they should be known.

The sense is, one shall be hindred from Reigning by another, whom he
shall accuse of Treason against the King.


LXXXV.

    French.

    La grand Cité de _Tharse_ par _Gaulois_,
    Sera d’estriute captifs tous a _Turban_,
    Secours par Mer du grand _Portugalois_,
    Premier d’esté le jour du sacre _Vrban_.

    English.

    The great City of _Tharsis_ shall be taken by the _French_,
    All those that were at _Turban_ shall be made slaves,
    Succours by Sea from the great _Portugals_,
    The first day of the Summer, and of the installation of _Urban_.

ANNOT.

Here are two difficulties in this Stanza; the first is, what the Author
means by the great City _Tharsis_; the second is in the last Verse, what
he meaneth by the Installation of _Vrban_, I believe he meaneth no more
then the election of a Pope, whose name shall be _Urban_.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    Le grand Prelat un jour apres son songe,
    Interprete au rebours de son sens,
    De la _Gascogne_ luy surviendra un Monge,
    Qui fera eslire le grand Prelat de _Sens_.

    English.

    The great Prelate the next day after his dream,
    Interpreted contrary to his sense,
    From _Gascony_ shall come to him a Monge,
    That shall cause the great Prelate of _Sens_ to be elected.

ANNOT.

_Monge_ is a Barbarous word, that hath no relation to any Language in the
world, (that I know) unless it signifies a Monk. _Sens_ is a fine City,
about threescore Miles beyond _Paris_, towards the South, and the Seat of
an Arch-Bishop, who it seemeth shall be elected into some eminent place,
the next day after he that was in it shall dream a dream, that shall be
interpreted contrary to the sense and meaning of it.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    L’election faicte dans _Francfort_,
    N’aura nul lieu, _Milan_ s’opposera,
    Le sien plus proche semblera si grand fort,

    English.

    The election made at _Francford_,
    Shall be void, _Milan_ shall oppose it,
    He of the _Milan_ party shall be so strong,
    As to drive the other beyond the Marshes of the _Rhine_.

ANNOT.

The Election of _Francford_ is concerning an Emperour; for there they are
elected, Crowned. The rest is plain.


LXXXVIII.

    French.

    Un Regne grand demourra desolé,
    Aupres de l’_Hebro_ se seront assemblées,
    Monts _Pyrenees_ le rendront consolé,

    English.

    A great Kingdom shall be left desolate,
    Near the River _Hebrus_ an assembly shall be made,
    The _Pyrenean_ Mountains shall comfort him,
    When in _May_ shall be an Earth-quake.

ANNOT.

This needeth no interpretation, but what any one may give that knoweth
where the River _Hebrus_ is.

    Entre deux cymbes pieds & mains attachez,

    English.

    Between two Boats one shall be tyed hand and foot,
    His face annointed with Honey, and he nourished with Milk,
    Wasps and Bees shall make much of him in anger,
    For being treacherous Cup-bearers, and poisoning the Cup.

ANNOT.

This is a description of the punishment which the _Persians_ use to
afflict upon poisoners; for they were put between two Troughs, which are
here called Boats, from their likeness to them, with their face only
uncovered, which was daubed with Honey, that the Wasps and Bees might
be drawn to it and torment them, they were fed with Milk, which if they
refused to do, and had rather dye than be so tormented, then did the
Tormenter prick their Eyes with Needles to force them to their diet, and
so were they left, till the Vermin eat them up. We have an example of
this in the Life of _Artaxerxes_ King of _Persia_.


XC.

    French.

    L’honnessement puant abominable,

    English.

    The stinking and abominable defiling
    After the secret shall succeed well,
    The great one shall be excused for not being favourable,
    That _Neptune_ might be perswaded to peace.

ANNOT.

By the two first Verses it seemeth that some abominable action, after its
effect shall succeed well; the two last signifie, that a great person
shall be excused for not permitting the Fleet to be at peace.


XCI.

    French.

    Le conducteur de la guerre Navale,

    English.

    The leader of the naval forces,
    Red, rash, severe, horrible extortioner,
    Being slave, shall escape, hidden amongst the Harnesses,
    When a Son named _Agrippa_, shall be born to the great one.

ANNOT.

This needeth no Interpretation, the words being so plain.

    A Princess of an exquisite beauty,
    Shall be brought to the General, the second time the fact shall be
      betrayed,
    The City shall be given to the Sword and fire,
    By two great a murder the chief Person about the King shall be hated.

ANNOT.

The only difficulty lyes in what City he doth mean.

    A covetous Prelate, deceived by ambition,

    His messengers and he shall be trapt,

    English.

    A King shall be angry against the Covenant-breakers,
    When the Warlike Armour shall be forbidden,
    The Poison with Sugar shall be put in the Strawberries,
    They shall be murdered and die, saying, close, close.

ANNOT.

The words are plain.

    English.

    The youngest Son shall be calumniated by a slanderer,
    When enormous and Martial deeds shall be done,
    The least part shall be left doubtfull to the
    Eldest, and soon after they shall be both equal in the Kingdom.

ANNOT.

This lacketh no interpretation.


XCVI.

    French.

    Grand Cité a Soldats abandonnée,
    Onc ny eut mortel tumult si proche,
    O quelle hideuse calamités approche,
    Fors une offence n’y sera pardonnée.

    English.

    A great City shall be given up to the Souldiers,
    There was never a mortal tumult so near,
    Oh! what a hideous calamity draws near,
    Except one offence nothing shall be spared.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the taking of the Town of St. _Quentin_ in 1557.
because the Author saith, no tumult was like this, so near the year 1555.
when our Author writ.

He calleth it great City; because it is one of the most considerable in
_France_, therefore it was besieged by the King of _Spain_ with 37000.
men, and 12000. Horses and 8000. _English_. The plunder was given to the
Souldiers; for it was taken by assault.

_There was never a mortal tumult so near_; for the Souldiers taking
revenge upon the Inhabitants, and Garrison, put all to the Sword; the
Admiral having much ado to save himself.

In consequence of this our Prophet cryeth, _O what a fearfull calamity_;
because the taking of this Town joyned with the loss of St. _Laurence_
did almost ruine _France_. He addeth, _except one offence nothing shall
be forgiven_; that is, the Town should be afflicted in all respects,
except that it should not be burnt. The taking of this Town was upon the
27 of _August_, 17 days after the Battle of St. _Laurence_.

The loss was so great to _France_, that the King was fained to call the
Duke of _Guise_ back from _Italy_, and _Charles_ V. hearing this news,
asked presently if his Son _Philip_ was not in _Paris_, as much as to
say, it was a thing he ought to have done.

But God permitted that the King of _Spain_ went another way, and in the
mean time, the King of _France_ strengthned himself, and the Duke of
_Guise_ took from the _English_, _Calais_, _Guines_, and the County of
d’_Oye_. The _Spanish_ History saith, that _Philip_ had forbidden to
touch any old people, Children and Ecclesiastical persons; but above all
St. _Quentins_ reliques.


XCVII.

    French.

    Cinq & quarante degrez ciel bruslera,
    Feu approcher de la grand Cité neuve,

    English.

    The Heaven shall burn at five and forty degrees,
    The fire shall come near the great new City,
    In an instant a great flame dispersed shall burst out,
    When they shall make a trial of the _Normans_.

ANNOT.

This signifies some extraordinary lightning under five and forty degrees,
which is about the Southern part of _France_.

It is not easie to guess what he meaneth by the great new City, unless it
be one in the Authors Countrey, called _Villa Nova_.

The last Verse seemeth to intimate, that this shall happen when an Army
of _Normandie_ shall be raised.


XCVIII.

    French.

    Ruyne aux _Volsques_ de peur si fort terribles,
    Leur grand Cité taincte, faict pestilent:

    English.

    A ruine shall happen to the _Volsques_ that are so terrible,
    Their great City shall be dyed, a pestilent deed:
    They shall plunder Sun and Moon, and violate their Temples,
    And the two Rivers shall be red with running blood.

ANNOT.

The _Volsi_ were a warlike people of _Italy_ joyning to _Rome_, which
makes me believe that by the great City he meaneth _Rome_, which was
plundered and sackt by the Duke of _Burgondy_ and the Prince of _Orange_,
Generals of the Emperour _Charles_ V.


XCIX.

    French.

    L’Ennemy docte se tournera confus,

    English.

    The learned enemy shall go back confounded,
    A great Camp shall be sick, and in effect through ambush,
    The _Pyrenean_ Mountains shall refuse him.
    Near the River discovering the ancient Hives.

ANNOT.

The words are plain, though the sense be too obscure, and I shall not
endeavour to give an interpretation, when every one may make one himself.

    Fill de _Laure_, asyle du mal sain,
    Ou jusqu’au Ciel se void l’_Amphitheatre_:

    English.

    Daughter of _Laura_, Sanctuary of the sick,
    Where to the Heavens is seen the _Amphitheatre_,
    A prodigy being seen, the danger is near,
    Thou shalt be taken captive above four times.

ANNOT.

This is an ingenious Stanza, concerning the City of _Nismes_ in
_Languedoc_, famous for its _Amphitheatre_ built by the _Romans_, and
remaining to this day, which Town he calleth Daughter of _Laura_, because
the Lady _Laura_, Mistress to the famous Poet _Petrarche_ was born
thereabout; he also calleth it Sanctuary of the sick, for the salubrity
of the air.

The meaning of the two last Verses is, that when a prodigy shall be seen,
_viz._ Civil War in _France_, it shall be taken above four times, as it
hath happened by one party or other.

    The bow of the Treasure by _Achilles_ deceived,
    Shall shew to posterity the Quadrangulary,
    In the Royal deed the Comment shall be known,
    The body shall be seen hanged in the knowledge of the people.

ANNOT.

By the bow of the Treasure, is understood the Marshal d’_Ancre_, Favorite
to the Queen Regent of _France_ _Mary_ of _Medicis_, who was first
complained of, for his maleversations by _Achilles de Harlay_ President
of _Paris_, whence followed his death being Pistolled in the Quadrangle
of the _Louvre_, by the command of _Lewis_ XIII. and his body afterwards
dragged through the streets, and hanged publickly by the people upon the
new Bridge.

    By night the Souldiers shall be astonished,

    Under the fained shadow you shall see them proclaimed Traitors.

_Arles_ is a considerable City in _France_; the rest is plain.

the Kingdom; _Dole_ is a City in _Burgundy_, so is _Autun_ and _Lion_,
_Geneva_ is a City by _Savoy_, _Auspourg_, another in _Germany_,

_Sicily_. _Corsica_, an Island in the _Mediterranean Sea_, belonging to
the _Genoese_; _Salerno_ is a Town in _Italy_; _Sardinia_ an Island in
the _Mediterranean_. The Reader may easily make an interpretation of the
rest.

the rest is easie.

    A Lady in the absence of her great Captain,
    Shall be intreated of love by the Viceroy,
    A fained promise, and unhappy new years gift,

ANNOT.

_Bar_ is a principality joyning to _Lorrain_, which _Henry_ IV. King of
_France_ gave for a Portion to his Sister _Catharine_, when she married
the Duke of _Lorrains_ Son. The rest is plain.


X.

    French.

    Par le grand Prince limitrophe du _Mans_,

_France_, being then about 15 years of age, by the perswasion of some
Grandees about him, made War against his own Mother _Mary_ of _Medicis_,
then Regent of the Kingdom, whereupon was fought between them the Battle
_du pont de say_, where above five hundred on the Queens side were slain,
whereupon it was a good Jest of the Prince of _Guimena_, who being
required by the Queen _Anna_ of _Austria_, to lay his hand upon her side;
and to feel her Child (now _Lewis_ XIV.) stirring, after he had felt; now
I know, said he, he is a true Son of _Bourbon_; for he beginneth to kick
his Mother.

    English.

    They shall expound Topography falsly,
    The Urnes of the Monuments shall be open,
    Sects shall multiply, and holy Philosophy
    Shall give black for white, and green for old.

ANNOT.

This is a perfect description of our late miserable estate in _England_,
when there was such multiplicity of Sects, and such a Prophanation of
sacred things.


XV.

    The deep entry made by the Queen,
    Shall make the place powerful and inaccessible,

shall be impregnable, and the Army of Lions, that is either Generals, or
of a Prince that shall bear three Lions in his Arms, shall be routed.


XVII.

    English.

    The Prince rare in pity and Clemency,
    After he shall have given peace to his Subjects,
    Shall by death change his great knowledge,
    After great rest the Kingdom shall be troubled.

ANNOT.

This positively concerneth _Henry_ the IV. King of _France_; who after
he had by many Battles and dangers given peace to his Kingdom, was by a
Murderer snatched away, and the Kingdom put into new troubles, by the war
that the Princes had among themselves.


XVIII.

    French.

    Les Assiegez couloureront leurs paches,

    The Fort _Nicene_ shall not be fought against,
    By shining metal it shall be overcome,
    The doing of it shall be long and debating,
    It shall be a strange fearful thing to the Citizens.

ANNOT.

_Nice_ is a Town in _Piemont_, situated by the Sea side, now whether
this Prophecy came to pass in the time of the Wars between _France_ and
_Savoy_, or shall come to pass hereafter, it is more then I can tell. As
for winning of it by glistering Metal, it is no new thing or practice,
witness _Philippus_ of _Macedon_, who said no City was impregnable,
wherein might enter an Ass loaded with gold.


XX.

    French.

    Ambassadeurs de la _Toscane_ langue,
    _Avril_ & _May_ _Alpes_ & Mer passer,

    Vie _Gauloise_ en voulant effacer.

    English.

    The Embassadors of the _Tuscan_ tongue,
    In _April_ and _May_, shall go over the _Alpes_ and the Sea,
    One like a Calf shall make a speech:
    Attempting to defame the _French_ customes.

ANNOT.

The sense and the words are plain.


XXI.

    French.

    Par pestilente inimitie _Volsicque_,
    Dissimulée chassera le Tyran,
    Au Pont de _Sorgues_ se fera la trafique,
    De mettre a mort luy & son adherent.

    English.

    By a pestilent _Italian_ enmity,
    The dissembler shall expel the Tyrant,
    The bargain shall be made at _Sorgues_ Bridge,
    To put him and his adherent to death.

ANNOT.

There is no difficulty in this.


XXII.

    French.

    Les Citoiens de _Mesopotamie_,
    Irez encontre amis de _Tarragone_,
    Jeux, Ris, Banquets toute gent endormie,
    Vicaire au Prone, pris Cité, ceux d’_Ausone_.

    English.

    The Citizens of _Mesopotamia_,
    Being angry with the friends of _Tarragone_,
    Playes, laughter, feasts, every body being asleep,
    The Vicar being in the Pulpit, City taken by those of _Ausone_.

ANNOT.

By the Citizens of _Mesopotamia_, is understood a people that live
between two Rivers, from the Greek words μέσος and ποταμὸς, the rest is
easie. We have said before, that by _Ausone_ the Author understands the
City of _Bourdeaux_, which he called _Ausone_, from the Poet and Consul
of _Rome_ _Ausonius_ who was born there.


XXIII.

    French.

    Le Roial Sceptre sera contraint de prendre,
    Ce que ses Predecesseurs voient engagé,
    Puis a Laigneau on fera mal entendre,
    Lors qu’on viendra le Palais saccager.

    English.

    The Royal Scepter shall be constrained to take
    What his Predecessors had morgaged;
    After that, they shall mis-inform the Lamb,
    When they shall come to plunder the Palace.

ANNOT.

This is obvious to every body’s capacity.


XXIV.

    French.

    L’Ensevely sortira du tombeau,
    Fera de chaisnes lier le fort du pont,
    Empoisoné avec œufs de Barbeau,
    Grand de _Lorrain_ par le Marquis du pont.

    English.

    The buried shall come out of his Grave,
    He shall cause the fort of the Bridge to be tied with Chains,
    Poisoned with Barbels hard Row,
    Shall a great one of _Lorrain_ be by the Marques du pont.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is divided in two parts. The first two Verses talk of a
man that shall be taken out of his Grave alive. The two last speak, that
a great man of _Lorrain_ shall be poisoned by the Marques _de pont_, in
the Row of a Barbel, which according to Physitians, is a dangerous meat
of it self, and chiefly if it be Stewed, the Poisoner himself seemeth to
be no other than a Duke of _Lorrain_, or one of his Sons, for he stileth
himself _N._ Duke of _Lorrain_, Prince of _Bar_, and Marques _du Pont_.


XXV.

    French.

    Par guerre longue tout l’exercite espuiser,
    Que pour Soldats ne trouveront pecune,
    Lieu d’Or, d’Argent cair on viendra cuser,
    _Gaulois_ Ærain, signe croissant de Lune.

    English.

    By a long War, all the Army drained dry,
    So that to raise Souldiers they shall find no Money,
    Instead of Gold and Silver, they shall stamp Leather,
    The _French_ Copper, the mark of the stamp the new Moon.

ANNOT.

This maketh me remember the miserable condition of many Kingdoms, before
the _west-Indies_ were discovered; for in _Spain_ Lead was stamped for
Money, and so in _France_ in the time of King _Dagobert_, and it seemeth
by this Stanza, that the like is to come again, by reason of a long and
tedious War.


XXVI.

    French.

    Fustes Galées autour de sept Navires,
    Sera livrée une mortelle guerre,
    Chef de _Madrid_ recevra coups de vires,
    Deux eschapées & cinq menez a Terre.

    English.

    Fly-boats and Galleys round about seven Ships,
    A mortal War there shall be,
    The chief of _Madrid_ shall receive blows of Oars,
    Two shall escape, and five carried to Land.

ANNOT.

_Paradin_ saith in his History, that in the year 1555. towards the end
of _August_, those of _Diepe_ had permission from the King to fight a
Fleet of the _Spaniards_, which was coming into _Flanders_, and brought
Men, Money, and several Merchandises. They went to Sea, and after much
searching, they discovered the Fleet, wherein were 22 great Ships.

The _Diepois_ had but 19 men of War, and five or six Pinnaces, with which
they set upon them between _Calais_ and _Dover_. The fight was very
bloody, almost all the Ships grapled one with another, and being so close
together, represented a Land fight.

The _French_ at last did their utmost endeavour against the Admiral,
which was succoured by six other Ships, of which two were taken with the
Admiral, and carryed to _Diepe_; this is the Authors meaning, when he
saith, _Fly-boats and Galleys about seven Ships_. He nameth the Admiral
_Chief of Madrid_; that is, chief _Spaniard_, which received blows of
Oars, whose Ship was taken, and four more of his Company, which were
brought to _Diepe_. In this agree the Historians on both sides.


XXVII.

    French.

    Au coin de _Vast_ la grand Cavalerie,
    Proche a _Ferrare_ empeschée au Bagage,
    _Pompe_ a _Turin_ front telle volerie,
    Que dans le fort raviront leur hostage.

    English.

    In the corner of _Vast_ the great Troop of Horse,
    Near _Ferrara_, shall be busied about the baggage,
    _Pompe_ at _Turin_, they shall make such a robbery,
    That in the Fort they shall ravish their hostage.

ANNOT.

I could not find what he meaneth by this place _Vast_, which being the
Key of all the rest, I could proceed no further, but am constrained to go
to bed, and leave this for to night, among _Insolubilia de Alliaco_.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Le Capitaine conduira grande proye,
    Sur la Montagne des ennemis plus proche,
    Environné par feu fera telle voye,
    Tous eschapez, or trente mis en broche.

    English.

    The Captain shall lead a great Prey
    Upon the Mountain, that shall be nearest to the Enemies,
    Being encompassed with fire, he shall make such a way,
    That all shall escape, but thirty that shall be spitted.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are plain.

The meaning of the last two is, that the said Captain being encompassed
with Fire, shall make himself such a way, that all his men shall escape,
but thirty that shall be spitted by the enemies.


XXIX.

    French.

    Le grand Duc d’_Albe_ se viendra rebeller,
    A ses grands peres fera le tradiment,
    Le grand de _Guise_ le viendra debeller,
    Captif mené & dresse monument.

    English.

    The great Duke of _Alba_ shall rebel,
    To his Grandfathers he shall make the Plot,
    The great _Guise_ shall vanquish him,
    Led Prisoner, and a Monument erected.

ANNOT.

_Ferdinand_ of _Toledo_, Duke of _Alba_ in _Spain_, a faithfull servant
of _Charles_ V. and _Philip_ II. his Son, after he had made several
proofs of his Valour, and prudence in the affairs of _Piemont_ and
_Milanese_, was commanded to go to _Naples_ and _Rome_, to succour the
_Colonesse_, and others of the _Spanish_ party; to obey this command,
the Author saith, _He went about to rebel_, not against his Prince, but
his _Grandfathers_, _viz._ the Pope and the Cardinals, upon which the
Senate of _Venice_ wrote to him, desiring that he would not trouble the
Pope, seeing that all his Predecessors had fought for him, as the Lord of
_Thou_ saith in his sixteenth Book; but he answered, that it was the Pope
himself that was the cause of it, and that he was bound to oppose him.

During that rebellion to his great fathers, as the Author calleth it, the
great _de Guise_, came with his Troops, and compelled him to a diversion,
and to let alone Marshal _Strozzy_, the Cardinal _Caraffa_, Captain
_Montluc_, _Camillo Ursini_, Captain _Charry_, and others; so that all
the Countrey about _Rome_ was freed, and thus the Author saith, _the
great de Guise shall come to quell him_.

The fourth Verse addeth two things, that a Prisoner was carryed away, and
that a Monument was erected. History makes no mention of the Prisoner,
unless it were that Captain _Montluc_, having taken by assault the
Town of _Pianea_ or _Corsmian_, by a sink which he broke; the Captain
_Gougues_ a _Gascon_ being a Prisoner of War in the Town, with many
others, and hearing the cries of _France, France_, perswaded his Comrades
to fall upon their Keepers, and to kill them with their own weapons and
this Prisoner that was taken at _Montisel_, was brought back again into
_France_, as well for his known Valour, as for his Warlike deliverance,
and since that made himself famous in _Florida_.

_As for the Monument erected_, makes me think he meaneth the Constable of
_France_, who was taken Prisoner at the Battle of St. _Quentin_, and by
the Monument, he meaneth the _Escurial_, which _Philip_ the II. caused
to be built in memory of that Victory, which obliged _Henry_ the II. to
call back again in all hast the Duke of _Guise_ with all his Forces, or
else _France_ had been in danger to be lost.


XXX.

    French.

    Le sac sapproche, feu, grand sang espandu,
    _Pau_ grand Fleuve, aux Bouviers l’entreprise,
    De _Genes_, _Nice_ apres long temps attendu,
    _Fossan_, _Thurin_, a _Savillan_ la prise.

    English.

    The plundering draws near, fire, abundance of blood spilt,
    _Pau_ a great River, an enterprise by Herdsmen,
    Of _Genes_, _Nice_ after they shall have staid long,
    _Fossan_, _Thurin_, the prize shall be at _Savillan_.

ANNOT.

The plundering draweth near, here the Author speaketh of things that
should happen in his days. He writ this the first of _March_ 1555.
and History mentioneth that from the first of _March_ 1555. till the
beginning of 1559. the plundering of _Piemont_ in _Italy_ was very great,
since the taking of _Cazal_ by the _French_, for there was nothing but
continual fightings, taking and retaking Towns, Skirmishes and Battles,
and most of them by the River _Pau_, the greatest of _Italy_. The rest
of the second Verse, and the beginning of the third saith, that the
undertaking of _Genoa_ shall be by the Herdsmen, by whom he meaneth the
_Turks_, who being called by the _French_ to help them in the taking of
_Nice_, made an action fit for Herdsmen and villanous Traitors, doing
nothing, because they had been bribed by the _Genoeses_.

This was done after the _French_ had stay’d long for this infidel, who
endeavoured to delude the _French_, and take all for himself; and this
is the meaning of, _After Nice had stayed long_. In the mean time the
_Spaniards_ increased their Victories, as the fourth Verse witnesseth to
the taking of _Fossan_, _Thurin_, and _Savillan_.

_Fossan_ is a Town of _Piemont_, which that it might be distinguished
from _Marseilles_, which the Author often calleth _Fossen_ or _Phocen_,
he putteth in the Epithete of _Thurin_, to signifie he meaneth _Fossan_
in _Piemont_.

He saith that _Fossan_ of _Piemont_ shall have the taking towards
_Savillan_, that is, this _Fossan_ which belongeth to the _Spaniards_,
will take some Towns near _Sivillan_.


XXXI.

    French.

    De _Languedoc_, & _Guienna_ plus de dix
    Mille, voudront les _Alpes_ repasser.
    Grans _Allobroges_ marcher contre _Brundis_,

    English.

    From _Languedoc_, and _Guienna_ more then 10000.
    Would be glad to come back over the _Alpes_.
    Great _Allobroges_ shall march against _Brundis_,
    _Aquin_ and _Bresse_ shall beat them back.

ANNOT.

_Languedoc_ and _Guienne_ are two Provinces in _France_, from whence many
Souldiers shall be raised to go into _Italy_, but being distressed, shall
wish to come back again over the _Alpes_. By the great _Allobroges_,
I understand those of _Savoy_ and _Piemont_, who shall go against
_Brundis_, in Latine _Brundusium_, but shall be beaten back by _Aquin_
and _Bresses_, Cities belonging to the _Venetians_.


XXXII.

    French.

    English.

    One that shall tyranise over Duke and Earl,
    He shall raise an Army in the Land of _Millan_,
    He shall exhaust _Favence_ and _Florence_ of their gold.

ANNOT.

This needeth no Interpretation.

    English.

    By fraud a Kingdom and an Army shall be spoilt,
    The Fleet shall be put to a strait, passages shall be made to the
      spies,
    Two feigned friends shall agree together,
    They shall raise up a hatred that had been long dormant.

ANNOT.

The words are plain.


XXXIV.

    En grand regret sera la gent _Gauloise_,
    Cœur vain, leger croira temerité,
    Pain, sel, ne vin eau venin ne cervoise,
    Plus grand captif, faim, froid, necessité.

    English.

    In great regret shall the _French_ Nation be.
    Their vain and light heart shall believe rashly.
    They shall have neither Bread, Salt, Wine, nor Beer,
    Moreover they shall be Prisoners, and shall suffer hunger, cold,
      and need.

ANNOT.

The words are plain, and the onely question is whither this distress
threatned here to _France_ is past or to come.


XXXV.

    French.

    La grand poche viendra plaindre pleurer,
    D’avoir esleu, trompez seront en l’Aage,

    English.

    The great Pocket shall bewaile and bemoan,
    For having Elected one, they shall be deceived in his Age,
    He shall not stay long with them,
    He shall be deceived by those of his own language.

ANNOT.

The great Pocket which is the Key of this Stanza being obscure, forceth
me to leave the rest unperfect.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Dieu, le Ciel tout le Divin Verbe a l’Onde,
    Porté par rouges sept razes a _Bizance_,
    Contre les oingts trois cens de _Trebisonde_,
    Deux Loix mettront, & horreur, puis credence.

    English.

    God, Heaven, all the Divine Word in water,
    Carryed by red ones, seven shaved heads at _Bisantium_,
    Against the anointed three hundred of _Trebisond_,
    They shall put two Laws, and horror, and afterwards believe.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to foretel that the Sacrament according to the
_Roman_ Church, shall be carried by Cardinals and seven Priests to
_Constantinople_, against which three hundred of _Trebison_ shall
dispute, who shall compare the two Laws with horror, and afterwards
believe.

    French.

    Dix envoyez, chef de nef mettre a mort,
    D’un adverty, en classe guerre ouverte,
    Confusion chef, l’un se picque & mord,

    English.

    Ten shall be sent to put the Captain of the Ship to death,
    He shall have notice by one, the Fleet shall be in open War,
    A confusion shall be amongst the Chief, one pricks and bites,
    _Leryn_, _Stecades_ nefs, caps dedans la nerte.

ANNOT.

The three first Verses are plain; as for the fourth I believe it to be
the Language of the _Antipodes_, for I think no man can understand it.

    French.

    L’Aisné Roial sur coursier voltigeant,
    Picquer viendra si rudement courir,
    Gueule lipée, pied dans l’Estrein pleignant,
    Traine, tiré, horriblement mourir.

    English.

    The eldest Royal prancing upon a Horse,
    Shall spur, and run very fiercely
    Open mouth, the foot in the Stirrup, complaining,
    Drawn, pulled, die horribly.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth of the eldest Son of a King, who prancing upon his
Horse, shall Spur and run so fiercely, that his foot being intangled in
the Stirrup he shall be dragged and pulled, and die a fearful death.

In the year 1555. upon the 25 of _May_, this came to pass in the person
of _Henry_ of _Albret_, the second of that name, King of _Navarre_.

This Prince _Henry_ II. the eldest Royal riding upon a horse did spur him
so hard, that he ran away with him, so that he perceiving the danger he
was in, pulled the Bridle so hard that the horse’s mouth was broken; the
pain did not stop the horse, but contrariwise, he grew the more untoward,
that _Henry_ fell down, and in falling one of his feet hung in the
stirrup, so that he was drawn, and died a horrid death. This I found in
the History of _Naples_.


XXXIX.

    French.

    Le conducteur de l’Armée _Francoise_,

    English.

    The leader of the _French_ Army,
    Thinking to rout the chiefest Phalange,
    Upon the Pavement of _Avaigne_, and Slate,
    Shall sink in the ground by _Gennes_, a strange Nation.

ANNOT.

It seemeth that a _French_ General, thinking to rout and overcome the
chiefest strength of his enemy, and going upon a brittle Pavement, made
of Slate, shall sink in the ground not far from _Genoa_, which he calleth
a strange Nation to the _French_.

    English.

    With Pipes annointed without with Oyl and Grease,
    Before the harbour, one and twenty shall be shut,
    At the second Watch, by death, they shall do great feats of Arms,
    To win the Gates, and be killed by the Watch.

ANNOT.

The words and sense of this Stanza are plain.


XLI.

    French.

    Les os des pieds, & des mains enferrez,

    Maison salubre & sans bruit habitée.

    English.

    The bones of the feet and of the hands in shackles,
    By a noise a house shall be a long time deserted,
    By a dream the buried shall be taken out of the ground,
    The house shall be healthful, and inhabited without noise.

ANNOT.

I have found the truth of this Stanza upon the place, in my going to
_Lion_, it was my fortune to lye at a Town four Leagues on this side of
it, called _Lapacodier_, where this Story was told me to have happened
few days before.

It chanced that a Company of Foot was to lie in the Town, and distressed
for quarter, they enquired why such a house was empty, and were told
it was not inhabited by reason of a noise heard there every night. The
Captain of the Troop resolved, since he feared not the living, not to
fear the dead, and thereupon lay in the house that night, where Beds
were provided for him, and about half a Dozen of his stoutest Souldiers;
so they laid down their weapons on the Table, and began to be merry at
Cards and Dice, expecting the event. The door being fast locked, about
twelve and one they heard as though some body knockt at the door, one
of the Souldiers by the Captains command, with a Pistol in his hand,
and a Candle, opened the door, then appeared to them a Phantasm, in the
shape of an old man, loaded with Chains, that made a great noise, this
Phantasm beckened to the Captain at the Table to come to him, the Captain
also rising, beckened to the Phantasm to come to him, this lasted for a
while, till the Captain resolved to go to him, and so taking a Candle in
one hand, and a Pistol in the other, bid his Souldiers follow him hand
in hand with their Arms, then taking the Phantasm by the hand, which was
exceeding cold, he led them into the Cellar, and through many turnings,
till at last the Phantasm vanished, and the Candles went out, then were
they constrained to remain there till day light, when perceiving where
they were, and having taken notice of the Place where the Phantasm left
them, they went out, and related the story to the Townsmen; so afterwards
they digged in that place, where they found a kind of a Trunk, and the
bones of a man in it shackled, they buryed the body in a Church-yard, and
no noise was heard afterwards in that house, this came to pass about 1624.

    French.

    Quand _Innocent_ tiendra le lieu de _Pierre_,
    Le _Nizaram Sicilian_ se verra,
    En grands honneurs, mais apres il cherra,
    Dans le bourbier d’une Civile guerre.

    English.

    When _Innocent_ shall hold the place of _Peter_,
    The _Sicilian Nizaram_ shall see himself
    In great honours, but after that he shall fall
    Into the dirt of a Civil war.

ANNOT.

Nothing can be more plain and true than this Prophecie, and those that
deny it, may also deny the light of the Sun, but to make it more evident,
we will examine it Verse by Verse.

_When ~Innocent~ shall hold the place of ~Peter~_; that is, when one
named _Innocent_ shall be Pope, as he was that preceded the last.

_The ~Sicilian Nizaram~ shall see himself in great honours_; that is, the
_Sicilian Nizarim_, for _Nizaram_, is the Annagramme of _Mazarin_, letter
for letter, who was born in _Sicily_, shall see himself in great honours,
as he did; for he was then in his greatest splendor.

_But after that he shall fall into the dirt of a Civil war_; As every one
knows he did, having put in Prison the Prince of _Condé_, the Prince of
_Conty_, and the Duke of _Congueiulle_, can any thing be more plain, and
yet when I read this forty years ago, I took it to be ridiculous.


XLIII.

    French.

    _Lutece_ en _Mars_, Senateurs en credit,
    Par une nuict _Gaule_ sera troublée,
    Du grand _Cræsus_ l’Horoscope predit,
    Par _Saturnus_, sa puissance exillée.

    English.

    _Lutetia_ in _Mars_, Senators shall be in credit.
    In a night _France_ shall be troubled,
    The Horoscope of the great _Cræsus_ foretelleth,
    That by _Saturn_ his power shall be put down.

ANNOT.

_Lutetia_ in Latine is the City of _Paris_, after the death of _Henry_
IV. the Parliament of _Paris_ began to prick up their ears, and to go
about to call the great ones to account, amongst whom was the Marquess
d’_Ancre_, favourite of the Queen Regent, that had gathered great
riches, and therefore is called here _Cræsus_, our Author saith, that
his power shall be put down by _Saturnus_, which must here be understood
mistically, which proved true, for by the Kings command, then _Lewis_
XIII. he was shot with three Pistols in the _Louvre_.


XLIV.

    French.

    Deux de poison saisis nouveaux Venus
    Dans la cuisine du grand Prince verser,
    Par le souillard tous deux au fait cogneus,
    Prins qui cuidoit de mort l’aisné vexer.

    English.

    Two newly come being provided with poison,
    To pour in the Kitchin of the great Prince,
    By the Cooks Boy the fact shall be known,
    And he taken, that thought by death to vex the elder.

ANNOT.

This came to pass in the time of _Henry_ IV. who was poisoned at _Melan_,
by two unknown men, who were discovered by the Cooks Boy in the doing of
it, and were both taken, the History is at large in _Peter Matthew_ his
Historiographer, which I could not insert here for the satisfaction of
the Reader; because I could not get the Book, the Reader may satisfie
himself upon the place.

    By the return from a _Barbarian_ travel,
    They shall exalt the Protestant entrance.

    English.

    Hot wind, councel, tears, fearfulness,
    He shall be assaulted in his bed by night without Arms,
    From that oppression shall be raised a great calamity,
    The _Epithalamium_ shall be converted into tears.

ANNOT.

The reason why I have put no Annotations to these, as I have done to
the rest, is, because according to my judgement, and that of the most
Learned, they are spurious.




TO THE READER.


Friendly Reader,

_Before you Read the following Epistle, I would have you be warned of
a few things: One is, that according to my opinion, it is very obscure
and intelligible in most places, being without any just connection, and
besides the obscurity of the sense, the crabbedness of the expression is
such, that had not the importunity of the Bookseller prevailed, I would
have left it out, but considering the respect due to Antiquity, the
satisfaction we owe to curious persons, who would perhaps have thought
the Book imperfect without it, we let it go, trusting to your Candor and
Ingenuity._

                                                                 Farewell.




THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ VIII. IX. & X.

_That had not been Printed before, and are in the same Edition of 1568._


TO THE

_Most Invincible, most High, and most Christian King of ~France~ ~HENRY~
the Second; ~Michael Nostradamus~ his most obedient Servant and Subject,
wisheth Victory and Happiness._

By reason of that singular observation, I had O most Christian and
Victorious King, since my Face, who had been cloudy a great while, did
present it self before your immeasurable Majesty. I have been ever since
perpetually dazled, continually honouring and worshipping that day, in
which I presented my self before it, as before a singular humane Majesty;
now seeking after some occasion, whereby I might make appear the goodness
and sincerity of my heart, and extend my acquaintance towards your most
Excellent Majesty; and seeing that it was impossible for me to declare it
by effects, as well because of the darkness and obscurity of my mind, as
for the enlightning it did receive from the face of the greatest Monarch
in the World; I was a great while before I could resolve to whom I should
Dedicate these three last Centuries of my Prophecies, which make the
compleat thousand, and after I had a long time considered, I have with
a great temerity made my address to your Majesty, being no ways dainted
by it, as the grave Author _Plutarch_ related in the Life of _Lycurgus_,
that seeing the offerings and gifts that were Sacrificed in the Temples
of their Heathen Gods, durst not come thither no more, least the people
should wonder at the costs and charges. Notwithstanding, seeing your
Royal Splendour joyned with an incomparable Humanity, I have made my
address to it, not as to the Kings of _Persia_, of whom to come near, it
was forbidden, but to a most Prudent and Wise Prince I have Dedicated
my Nocturnal and Prophetical Supputations, written rather by a natural
instinct, and Poetical furour, then by any rules of Poetry; and most
part of it written and agreeing with the Years, Months and Weeks, of the
Regions, Countreys and most part of the Towns and Cities in _Europe_;
touching also some thing of _Africa_, and of a part of _Asia_, by the
change of Regions that come near to those Climats, and compounded of
natural faction. But some body may answer (who hath need to blow his
Nose) the Rime to be as easie to be understood, as the intelligence of
the sence is hard and difficult, and therefore O most humane King, most
of the Prophetical Stanza’s are so difficult, that there is no way to
be found for the Interpretation of them; nevertheless being in hope of
setting down the Towns, Cities, and Regions, wherein most of those shall
happen, especially in the year 1585. and in the year 1606. beginning from
this present time, which is the 14. of _March_ 1557. and going further to
the fulfilling of those things, which shall be in the beginning of the
seventh Millenary, according as my Astronomical Calculation, and other
Learning could reach, at which time the adversaries of Christ and of his
Church shall begin to multiply; all hath been composed and calculated in
days and hours of Election, and well disposed, and all as accurately as
was possible for me to do. And the whole _Minerva libera & non invita_,
Calculating almost as much of the time that is come, as of that which
is past, comprehending it in the present time, and what by the course
of the said time shall be known to happen in all Regions punctually
as it is here written, adding nothing superfluous to it, although it
be said; _Quod de futuris contingentibus, non est determinata omnino
veritas_. It is very true Sir, that by my natural instinct given me by
my Progenitors, I did think I could foretel any thing; but having made
an agreement between this said instinct of mine, and a long Calculation
of Art, and by a great tranquility and repose of mind, emptied my Soul
of all care and carefulness, I have foretold most part of these _ex
tripode æneo_, though there be many who attribute to me some things that
are no more mine, then what is nothing at all. The only Eternal God,
who is the searcher of men’s hearts, being pious, just, and merciful,
is the true Judge of it, whom I beseech to defend me from the calumny
of the wicked men, who would as willing calumniously inquire for what
reason all your ancient Progenitors Kings of _France_ have healed the
disease called the _Kings-evil_, and some other Nations have cured the
biting of venomous Beasts; others have had a certain instinct to foretell
things that are to come, and of several others, too tedious to be here
inserted; notwithstanding those in whom the malignancy of the wicked
spirit shall not be suppressed by length of time; after my decease my
work shall be in more esteem, then when I was alive; nevertheless if I
should fail in the supputation of times, or could not please some, may it
please your most Imperial Majesty to forgive me, protesting before God
and his Saints, that I do not intend to insert any thing by writing in
this present Epistle, that may be contrary to the true Catholick Faith,
in conferring the Astronomical Calculation, according to my learning;
for the space of times of our Fathers that have been before us, are
such, submitting my self to the correction of the most Learned, that
the first man _Adam_ was before _Noah_, about one thousand two hundred
forty two years, not computing the time according to the supputation
of the _Gentiles_, as _Varro_ did, but onely according to the Sacred
Scriptures, and the weakness of my wit in my Astronomical Calculations.
After _Noah_ and the universal Flood about a thousand and fourscore years
came _Abraham_, who was a supreme Astrologer, according to most mens
opinion, and did first invent the _Chaldæan_ Letters; after that came
_Moses_, _viz._ some five hundred and fifteen or sixteen years after, and
between the time of _David_ and _Moses_ have passed about 570. years.
After which between the time of _David_ and that of our Saviour and
Redeemer Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin _Mary_, have passed (according
to some Chronographers) a thousand three hundred and fifty years. Some
body may object, that this supputation is not true; because it differeth
from that of _Eusebius_. And from the time of humane redemption, to that
of the execrable seduction of the _Saracens_, have passed six hundred
and four and twenty years, or thereabouts. From that time hitherto,
it is easie to collect what times are past, if my supputation be not
good among all Nations; because all hath been calculated by the course
of the Cœlestial bodies, joyned with motion, infused in me at certain
loose hours, by the motion of my ancient Progenitors; but the injury
of the time (most excellent King) requireth, that such secret events
should not be manifested, but by an enigmatical Sentence, having the
only sense, and one only intelligence, without having mixed with it
any ambiguous or amphibological calculation, but rather under a Cloudy
obscurity, through a natural infusion, coming near to the Sentence of
one of the Thousand and two Prophets, that have been since the Creation
of the World, according to the supputation and punical Chronick of
_Joel_. _Effundam spiritum meum super omnem, & carnem & prophetabunt
filli vestri & filiæ vestræ_: But such a Prophecy did proceed from the
mouth of the Holy Ghost, who was the Supreme and eternal Power, which
being come with that of the Cœlestial bodies, hath caused some of them to
foretel great and wonderful things; as for my part I challenge no such
thing in this place, God forbid, I confess truly, that all cometh from
God, for which I give him thanks, honour, and praise, without having
mixed any thing of that divination, which proceedeth _a Fato_, but only
of that which proceedeth _a Deo & Natura_, and most of it joyned with
the motion and course of the Cœlestial Bodies; insomuch that seeing
as in a burning Glass, and through a Cloudy Vision, the great and sad
events, the prodigious and calamitous accidents, that shall befall the
Worshippers, first of God, and secondly, those that are Earthly propped
up, with a thousand other calamitous accidents, which shall be known
in course of time; for God will take notice of the long barrenness of
the great Dame, who afterwards shall conceive two principal Children:
But being in danger, she that shall be added to her by the temerity of
age, running a danger in the 18, and not able to go beyond the 36, shall
leave behind her three females, and he shall have two that never had any
of the same father, the differences between the three Brothers shall be
such, and then shall they be united and agreed, insomuch that the three
and four parts of _Europe_ shall quake: by the lesser in years shall
the Christian Monarchy be upheld and augmented, Sects shall rise, and
presently be put down again, the _Arabians_ shall be put back, Kingdoms
shall be united, and new Laws made. Concerning the other Children; the
first shall possess the furious Crowned Lions, holding their Paws upon
the Escutcheons. The second, well attended, will go so deep among the
Lions, that the second way shall be open, all trembling and furious going
down, to get upon the _Pyrenæan_ Mountains. The ancient Monarchy shall
not be transferred, the third innundation of humane blood shall happen,
and for a good while _Mars_ shall not be in Lent. And the Daughter
shall be given for the preservation of the Church, the Dominator of it
falling into the _Pagan_ Forces of the new unbelievers, she shall have
two Children, one from faithfulness, and the other from unfaithfulness,
for the confirmation of the Catholick Church; and the other, who to his
confusion and late repentance, shall go about to ruine her. There shall
be three Regions by the extreme differences of the leagues, _viz._ the
_Roman_, the _German_, and the _Spanish_, who by a Military hand shall
make divers Sects, forsaking the 50 and 52 degrees of altitude, and all
those of remote Regions shall do homage to the Regions of _Europe_, and
of the North of 40 Degrees Altitude, who by a vain fright shall quake,
after that those of the West, South, and East shall quake because of
their power, insomuch that what shall be done, cannot be undone by
Warlike power. They shall be equal in Nature, but much different in
Faith. After this, the barren Dame of a greater power then the second,
shall be admitted by two people, by the first obstinate that had power
over the others; by the second, and by the third, that shall extend his
Circuit of the East of _Europe_, as far as the _Hungarians_, vanquished
and overcome, and by a Maritine Sail, shall make his excursions into
the _Trinarrian_ and _Adriatick_ Sea, by his _Mirmidons_, and _Germany_
shall fall, and the _Barbarian_ Sect shall be wholly driven from among
the Latines. Then the great Empire of Antichrist shall begin in the
_Attila_, and _Xerxes_ to come down with an innumerable multitude of
people, insomuch that the coming of the Holy Ghost, proceeding from
the 48 Degree, shall transmigrate, driving away the abomination of the
Antichrist, who made War against the Royal, who shall be the great Vicar
of _I. C._ and against his Church, and his Kingdom, _per tempus, & in
occasione temporis_, and before this shall precede a Solar Eclipse, the
most dark and obscure that was since the Creation of the World, till the
death and passion of _I. C._ and from him till then, and it shall be in
the Month of _October_, when such a great Translation shall be made, that
every body will think that the weight of the Earth, shall have lost its
natural motion, and be swallowed up in perpetual darkness. In the Spring
before and after this, shall happen extraordinary changes, mutations of
Kingdoms, and great Earth-quakes, with pullulation of the new _Babylons_
miserable daughter, increased by the abomination of the first Holocaust,
and shall last only 73 years and 7 Months, then from that Stock she
that had been long time barren, proceeding from the fifth Degree, who
shall renew all the Christian Church, and then shall be a great Peace,
Union and Concord, between one of the Children of the wandring and
seperated foreheads by divers Kingdoms, and such Peace shall be made,
that the Instigator and Promoter of Military function, by diversity of
Religions, shall be tied to the bottom of the deep, and the Kingdom of
the _Rabious_, who shall counterfeit the wise, shall be united. And the
Countreys, Towns, Cities and Provinces, that had deserted their first
ways to free themselves, captivating themselves more deeply, shall be
secretly angry at their liberty and Religion lost, and shall begin to
strike from the left, to turn to the right, restoring the holiness beaten
down long before with their former writing; so that after the great Dog,
shall come forth the biggest Mastif, who shall destroy all that was done
formerly, then Churches shall be built up again as before, the Clergy
shall be restored to its former state, and shall begin to Whore, and
Luxuriate, and to commit a Thousand Crimes. And being near unto another
desolation, when she shall be in her higher and more sublime dignity,
there shall rise powers and Military hands, who shall take away from
her the two Swords, and leave her only the Ensigns, from which by the
means of the crookedness that draweth them, the people causing it to go
straight, and not willing to submit unto them by the end opposite to
the sharp hand that toucheth the Ground, they shall provoke till that
a branch shall proceed from the barren, which shall deliver the people
of the World from that meek and voluntary slavery, putting themselves
under the protection of _Mars_, depriving _Jupiter_ of all his honours
and dignities, for the free City established and seated in another
little _Mesopotamia_. And the chief Governour shall be thrust out of
the middle, and set in the high place of the Air, being ignorant of the
conspiracy of the Conspirators, with the second _Thrasibulus_, who long
before did manage this thing, then shall the impurities and abominations
be objected with great shame, and made manifest to the darknes of the
darkened light, and shall cease towards the end of the change of his
Kingdom, the chief men of the Church shall be put back from the love of
God, and many of them shall apostatise from the true faith, and from the
true Sects, the middlemost of which by her worshippers, be a little put
into ruine; the first, wholly in all _Europe_, and most part of _Africa_
undone by the third, by the means of the poor in Spirit, who by madness
elevated, shall through libidinous luxury, commit adultery. The people
will rise and maintain it, and shall drive away those that did adhere to
the Legislators, and shall seem by the Kingdoms spoiled by the Eastern
men, that God the Creator hath loosed Satan from his Infernal Prison, to
cause to be born the great _Dog_ and _Doham_, who shall make so great
and abominable a fraction in the Churches, that the Red nor the White,
without Eyes and without Hands, shall not judge of it, and their power
shall be taken away from them. Then shall be a greater persecution
against the Church than ever was, and in the mean time shall be so great
a Plague, that two parts of three in the world shall fail, insomuch that
no body shall be able to know the true owners of fields and houses, and
there shall happen a total desolation unto the Clergy, and the Martial
men shall usurpe what shall come back from the City of the Sun, and
from _Molita_, and the _Stæchades_ Islands, and the great Chain of that
Port shall be open, which taketh its denomination from a Sea Oxe, and a
new incursion shall be made through the Sea Coasts, willing to deliver
the _Castulan_ Leap from the first Mahometan taking, and the assaulting
shall not altogether be in vain, and that place where the habitation of
_Abraham_ was, shall be assaulted by those, who shall have a respect for
the Jovials. And that City of _Achem_, shall be encompassed and assaulted
on all sides, by a great power of Armed men; their Sea Forces shall be
weakened by the Western men, and to that Kingdom shall happen great
desolation, and the great Cities shall be depopulated, and those that
shall come in, shall be comprehended within the vengeance of the wrath of
God, and the Sepulchre held in so great veneration, shall remain a great
while open to the universal Aspect of the Heavens, Sun and Moon, and the
sacred place shall be converted into a Stable for small and great Cattle,
and put to prophane uses. O what a calamitous affliction shall be then
for women with Child, and chiefly by the principal Easterly head, being
for the most part moved by the Northern and Westerly men, vanquished and
put to death, beaten, and all the rest put to flight, and the Children he
had by many women, put in Prison, then shall be fulfilled the Prophecy
of the Kingly Prophet. _Ut audiret gemitus compeditorum, ut solveret
filios interemptorum_, what great oppression shall be made then upon the
Princes and Governours of Kingdoms, and especially of those that shall
live Eastward and near the Sea, and their Languages inter-mixed very
sociably. The Language of the _Arabians_ and Latines by the _African_
communication, and all the Eastern Kings shall be driven away, beaten and
brought to nothing, not altogether by the means of the strength of the
Kings of the North, and by the drawing near of our age, by the means of
three secretly united, seeking for death by ambushes one against another.
And the renewing of the Triumvirate shall last seven years, while the
fame of such a sect shall be spread all the world over, and the Sacrifice
of the Holy and immaculate Host shall be upheld: And then shall the
Lords be two in number victorious in the North against the Eastern ones,
and there shall be such a great noise and Warlike tumult, that all the
East shall quake for fear of those two Brothers, not Northern Brothers.
And because, Sir, by this discourse, I put all things confusedly in
these predictions, as well concerning the event of them, as for the
account of the time which followeth, which is not at all, or very little
conformable to that I have done before, as well by Astronomical way,
as other of the sacred Scriptures which cannot erre, I could have set
down to every quatrain the time in which they shall happen, but it would
not please every body, much less the interpretation of them, till, Sir,
your Majesty hath granted me full power so to do, that my Calumniators
may have nothing to say against me. Nevertheless reckoning the years
since the Creation of the World to the Birth of _Noah_ have passed 1506.
years, and from the Birth of _Noah_ to the perfect building of the Ark
near the universal Flood have passed 600. years, whither solary, or
lunary, or mixed, for my part according to the Scriptures, I hold that
they were solary. And at the end of those 600. years _Noah_ entered into
the Ark, to save himself from the Flood, which Flood was universal upon
the Earth, and lasted a year and two months; and from the end of the
Flood, to the birth of _Abraham_ did pass the number of 295. years; and
from the birth of _Abraham_ to that of _Isaac_ did pass 100. years, and
from _Isaac_ to _Jacob_ 60. years; and from the time that he went into
_Ægypt_ till he came out of it, did pass 130. years; and from the time
that _Jacob_ went into _Ægypt_ till his posterity came out of it did
pass 430. years; and from the coming out of _Ægypt_ to the building of
_Salomon_’s Temple in the fourth year of his Reign did pass 480. years;
and from the building of the Temple till Jesus Christ, according to the
supputation of the Chronographers, did pass 490. years; and so by this
supputation, which I have gathered out of the Holy Scriptures, the whole
cometh to about 4173. years, eight Months more or less. But since the
time of I. C. hitherto, I leave it because of the diversity of Opinions.
And having calculated these present Prophecies according to the order
of the Chain, which containeth the revolution, and all by Astronomical
Doctrine, and according to my natural instinct, and after some time, and
in it comprehending since the time that _Saturn_ shall turn to come in on
the 7 of the Month of _April_, till the 25 of _August_; _Jupiter_ from
the 14 of _June_ to the 7 of _October_; _Mars_ from the 27 of _April_
till 22 of _June_; _Venus_ from the 9 of _April_ to the 22 of _May_;
_Mercury_ from the 3 of _February_ till the 24 of the same; afterwards
from the 1 of _June_ till the 24 of the same; and from the 25 of
_September_ till the 16 of _October_, _Saturn_ in _Capricorn_, _Jupiter_
in _Aquarius_, _Mars_ in _Scorpio_, _Venus_ in _Pisces_, _Mercury_ within
a Month in _Capricorn_, _Aquarius_ in _Pisces_, _Luna_ in _Aquarius_, the
_Dragons head_ in _Libra_, the Tail opposite to her sign according to a
Conjunction of _Jupiter_ and _Mercury_, with a quadrin Aspect of _Mars_
to _Mercury_, and the head of the _Dragon_ shall be with a Conjunction
of _Sol_ and _Jupiter_: the year shall be peacefull without Eclipse, and
in the beginning of that year shall be a greater persecution against the
Christian Church than ever was in _Affrica_, and it shall last till the
year 1792. at which time every body will think it a renovation of Age.
After that the _Roman_ people shall begin to stand upright again, and to
put away some obscure darknesses, receiving some of its former light,
but not without great divisions, and continual changes. _Venice_ after
that with great strength and power shall lift up her Wings so high, that
she will not be much inferiour to the strength of the old _Rome_, and
in that time great _Bizantine_ Sails, joyned with the _Ligustiques_, by
the Northern help and power shall give some hinderance, whereby those
of _Crete_ shall not keep their faith, the Arches built by the antient
Martial men, will keep company together with _Neptun_’s Waves. In the
_Adriatick_ shall be a great discord, what was united shall be parted
asunder, and what was before, and is a great City, will go near to becom
a house, including the _Pempotan_, and the _Mesopotamia_ of _Europe_ to
45, and others to 41, 42, and 37. And in that time, and Countrey, the
Infernal power shall rise against the Church of I. C. with the power of
the Enemies to his Law, which shall be the second Antechrist, who shall
persecute the said Church and its Vicar by the means of the power of
Temporal Kings, who through their Ignorance shall be seduced by Tongues
more sharp than any Sword in the hands of a mad man. The said Reign
of Antichrist shall not last but till the ending of him, born by Age,
and of the other in the City of _Plancus_, accompanied by the Elect of
_Modone_, _Fulcy_ by _Ferrara_, maintained by _Adriatick_, _Liguriens_,
and the proximity of the great _Trinacria_, and after that shall pass
over the Mount _Jovis_. The _Gallique Ogmyon_ followed with such a
number, that even from afar off the Empire of the great Law, shall be
presented to him, and then, and after shall be profusedly spilled the
blood of the Innocent by the Nocent, raised on high; then by great
Floods the memory of those things contained by such Instruments, shall
receive an innumerable loss, as also shall learning towards the North by
the Divine Will, Satan bound once more, and an universal Peace shall be
among men, and the Church of I. C. shall be free from all tribulation,
although the _Azosrains_ would fain mix among it the Honey of their
pestilent seduction, and this shall happen about the seventh Millinary;
so that the Sanctuary of I. C. shall be no more trodden down by the
unbelievers that shall come from the North, the world being near to
some conflagration, although by my supputations in my Prophecies, the
course of the time goeth much further. In the Epistle that within the
late years I have dedicated to my Son _Cæsar Nostradamus_, I have openly
enough declared some things, without prognosticating. But here (Sir) are
comprehended many great and wonderful events, which those that come after
us shall see. And during the said Astrological supputation, conferred
with the sacred Scripture, the persecution of the Clergy shall have its
beginning from the power of Northern Kings, joyned with the Eastern
ones; that persecution shall last Eleven years and a little less, at
which time the chief Northern King shall fail, which years being ended,
shall come in his united Southern one, who shall yet more violently
persecute the Clergy by the Apostatical seduction of one that shall
have the absolute power over the Militant Church of God: And the Holy
people of God and keeper of his Law, and all order of Religion shall be
grievously persecuted and afflicted, insomuch that the blood of the true
Ecclesiastical men shall float all over, and unto one of those horrid
Kings this praise shall be given by his followers to have spilt more
humane blood of the Innocent Clergymen, than any body can do Wine, and
the said King shall commit incredible crimes against the Church; humane
blood shall run through publick streets and Churches, as water coming
from an impetuous Rain, and the next Rivers shall be red with blood, and
by another Sea fight the Sea shall be red, insomuch that one King shall
say to another, _Bellis rubuit navalibus æquor_. After that in the same
year, & those that follow, shall happen the most horrid Plague, caused
by the precedent famine, and so great tribulations as ever did happen
since the first foundation of the Christian Church through all the Latine
Regions; some marks of it remaining in some Countreys of _Spain_. At
that time the Northern King hearing the complaint of the people of his
principal title, shall raise up so great an Army, and shall go through
the straights of his last Ancestors and Progenitors, that he will set up
all again in their first state, and the great Vicar of the Cope, shall
be restored in his former estate, but desolate and altogether forsaken,
and then shall the _Sancta sanctorum_ be destroyed by Paganism, and
the old and New Testament be thrust out and burnt, after that shall
Antechrist be the infernal Prince, and once more for the last all the
Kingdoms of Christendom and also of the unbelievers shall quake for the
space of 25 years, and there shall be more grievous Wars and Battles, and
Towns, Cities, Castles and other buildings shall be burnt, desolate, and
destroyed with a great effusion of Vestal blood, Married Women and Widows
ravished, sucking Children dashed against the Walls of the Towns, and so
many evils shall be committed by the means of the Infernal prince Satan,
that almost the universal world shall be undone and desolate, and before
these events many unusual Birds shall cry through the Air, _Huy, Huy_,
and a little while after shall vanish away: And after that time shall
have lasted a good while, there shall be renewed a Kingdom of _Saturn_
and Golden Age. God the Creator shall say, hearing the affliction of
his people, Satan shall be put, and tied in the bottom of the deep,
and there shall begin an universal peace between God and men, and the
Ecclesiastical power shall be in its greater force, and Satan shall be
left bound for the space of a thousand years, and then shall be loosed
again. All these Figures are justly fitted by the sacred Scripture, to
the visible Cœlestial things, _viz._ _Saturn_, _Jupiter_, and _Mars_,
and others joyned with them, as more at large may be seen in some of my
Stanza’s. I would have calculated it more deeply, and compared one with
the other, but seeing (most excellent King) that some stand ready to
censure me, I shall withdraw my Pen to its Nocturnal repose. _Multa etiam
O Rex potentissime præclara, & sane in brevi ventura, sed omnia in hac
tua Epistola innectere non possumus, nec volumus, sed ad intelligenda
quedam facta, horrida fata pauca libanda sunt, quamvis tanta sit in omnes
tua amplitudo & humanitas homines, deosque pietas, ut solus amplissimo
& Christianissimo regis nomine, & ad quem summa totius Religionis
authoritas deferatur, dignus esse videare._ But only I shall beseech you
O most Merciful King, through your singular and prudent goodness, to
understand rather the desire of my Heart, and the earnest desire I have
to obey your most excellent Majesty, since my Eyes were so near your
Royal Splendor, than the greatness of my work can deserve or require.

                   _From ~Selin~ this 27 ~June~, 1558._

THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ VIII.


I.

    French.

    _Pau_, _Nay_, _Loron_, plus feu qu’a sang sera,
    _Laude_ nager, fuir grands aux _Surrez_,
    Les _Agassas_ entrée refusera,
    _Pampon_, _Durance_, les tiendront enserrez.

    English.

    _Pau_, _Nay_, _Loron_, more in fire then blood shall be,
    _Lauda_ to swim, great ones run to the _Surrez_,
    The _Agassas_ shall refuse the entry,
    _Pampon_, _Durance_ shall keep them enclosed.

ANNOT.

The Prophecies of this, and of the remaining Centuries being for the
most part so obscure, as no man is able to make any sense of them, the
judicious Reader must not expect from me, what no man else can do; let
him suffice if I give him as much light as I can, and leave the rest to
his own judgement and industry.

_Pau_ is the chief Town of the Province of _Bearn_, in the Kingdom of
_Navarre_, where _Henry_ the IV. King of _France_ and _Navarre_ was born.
_Nay_ and _Loron_ are barbarous words, so are _Surrez_, _Agassas_ and
_Pampon_. _Durance_ is a River of _France_.


II.

    French.

    _Condon_ & _Aux_, & autour de _Mirande_,
    Je voy du Ciel feu qui les environne,
    _Sol_, _Mars_, conjoint au _Lion_, puis _Marmande_,
    Foudre, grand guerre, mur tomber dans _Garonne_.

    English.

    _Condon_ and _Aux_, and about _Mirande_,
    I see a fire from Heaven that encompasseth them,
    _Sol_, _Mars_, in conjunction with the Lion, and then _Marmande_,
    Lightning, great War, Wall falls into the _Garonne_.

ANNOT.

_Condon_, _Aux_, _Mirande_, and _Marmande_ are Towns in the Province of
_Guyenne_ and _Languedoc_, _Garonne_ is the River of _Bourdeaux_.


III.

    French.

    Au fort Chasteau de _Vigilanne_ & _Resviers_,
    Sera serré les puisnay de _Nancy_,
    Dedans _Turin_ seront ards les premiers,
    Lors que de dueil _Lyon_ sera transy.

    English.

    In the strong Castle of _Vigilanne_ and _Resviers_,
    Shall be kept close the youngest son of _Nancy_,
    Within _Turin_ the first shall be burnt up,
    When _Lyon_ shall be overwhelmed with sorrow.

ANNOT.

_Vigilanne_ and _Resviere_ being falsly writen here, it must be set down
_Veillane_ and _Riuiere_, which are two strong Castles, the first being
seated in _Piemont_, and the last in _Burgundy_.

_Nancy_ is the chief Town of _Lorrain_, and _Turin_ of _Piemont_, _Lyon_
is a famous City in _France_, so that the sense of this Prophecy seemeth
to be, that the youngest Son of _Nancy_, (that is of _Lorrain_) shall be
kept close Prisoner in those two Castles of _Veillane_ and _Riuiera_, and
that the chief men of _Turin_ shall be burnt, when the City of _Lyon_
shall be oppressed with sorrow.


IV.

    French.

    Dedans _Monech_ le Coq sera receu,
    Le Cardinal de _France_ apparoistra,
    Par _Logarion_ _Romain_ sera deceu,
    Foiblesse a l’Aigle, & force au Coq croistra.

    English.

    Within _Monech_ the Cock shall be admitted,
    The Cardinal of _France_ shall appear,
    By _Logarion_, _Roman_ shall be deceived,
    Weakness to the Eagle, and strength to the Cock shall grow.

ANNOT.

_Monech_ is false written here, it must be _Monaco_, which is a
Principality and Town in _Italy_ by _Genoa_, belonging to the House of
the _Grimaldi_, wherein the _French_ were admitted by the policy of
Cardinal _Richelieu_, during the Wars between _France_ and _Spain_.

_Logarion_ is a Barbarous name, by which he meaneth some body unknown to
us.

By the Eagle is meant the Emperour, who was very low at that time, and by
the Cock, the King of _France_, who was very powerful, where it is to be
observed, that by the Eagle the Emperour is always understood, because
it is his Arms, and by the Cock is meant the King of _France_, because a
_Frenchman_ is called in Latine _Galius_, which also signifieth a Cock.


V.

    French.

    Apparoistra Temple luisant orné,
    La Lampe & Cierge a _Borne_ & _Bretueil_,
    Pour la _Lucerne_ le Canton destourné,
    Quand on verra le grand Coq au Cercueil.

    English.

    A shining adorned Temple shall appear,
    The Lamp and wax Candle at _Borne_ and _Bretueil_,
    For _Lucerne_ the Canton turned of,
    When the great Cock shall be seen in his Coffin.

ANNOT.

_Borne_ and _Bretueil_ are two particular places, the first is one of the
four Baronies of the River _Mase_, _viz._ _Petersem_, _Steen_, _Horne_,
_Borne_, the other is a little Town in _Britany_.

_Lucerne_ is one of the Cantons of _Switzerland_. We have said before
what is meant by the great Cock, _viz._ the King of _France_. Let the
Reader make up the rest, according to his fancy.


VI.

    French.

    Charté fulgure a _Lyon_ apparente,
    Luysant, print _Malte_, subit sera estainte,
    _Sardon_, _Mauris_ traitera decevante,
    _Geneve_ a _Londres_, a Coq trahison feinte.

    English.

    A thundering light at _Lyons_ appearing,
    Bright, took _Maltha_, instantly shall be put out,
    Sardon shall treat _Mauris_ deceitfully,
    To _Geneva_, _London_, and the Cock a fained treason.

ANNOT.

_Maltha_ is an Island in the _Mediterranean_ Sea, famous for the Knights
that inhabit it, and take their name from thence. _Sardon_ and _Mauris_
are barbarous words.


VII.

    French.

    _Verceil_, _Milan_ donra intelligence,
    Dedans _Tycin_ sera faite la paye,
    Courir par _Seine_ eau, sang, feu par _Florence_,
    Unique choir d’hault en bas faisant maye.

    English.

    _Verceil_, _Milan_ shall give intelligence,
    In the _Tycin_ shall the Peace be made,
    Run through _Seine_ water, blood, fire through _Florence_,
    The only one shall fall from top to bottom making maye.

ANNOT.

_Verceil_ and _Milan_ are two Cities in _Italy_, the _Tycin_, or rather
_Thesin_ is a River of the same Countrey; _Seine_ is the River that
runneth at _Paris_. _Florence_ is a famous City in _Italy_, and _maye_ a
barbarous word, foisted up to patch up his Rime.


VIII.

    French.

    Pres de _Linterne_ dans des tonnes fermez,
    _Chivas_ fera pour l’Aigle la menée,
    L’Esleu cassé, luy ses ges enfermez,
    Dedans _Turin_ rapt espouse emmenée.

    English.

    Near _Linterne_, enclosed within Tuns,
    _Chivas_ shall drive the plot for the Eagle,
    The Elect cashiered, he and his men shut up,
    Within _Turin_, a rape, and Bride carried away.

ANNOT.

_Linterne_ is a small Town in _Italy_; by _Tuns_ are meant woodden
Vessels, such as they put Rhenish wines and others in.

_Chivas_ is a Town in _Piemont_, and _Turin_ the chief Town of the said
Countrey.


IX.

    French.

    Pendant que l’Aigle & le Coq a _Savone_,
    Seront unis, Mer, _Levant_ & _Hongrie_,
    L’Armée a _Naples_, _Palerme_, Marque d’_Ancone_,
    _Rome_, _Venise_, par barbe horrible crie.

    English.

    Whilst the Eagle and the Cock at _Savona_,
    Shall be united, Sea, _Levant_, and _Hungary_,
    Army at _Naples_, _Palermo_, Mark of _Ancona_,
    _Rome_, _Venice_, cry because of a horrid beard.

ANNOT.

By the Eagle is meant the Emperour, and by the Cock the King of _France_;
the rest is easie.


X.

    French.

    Puanteur grande sortira de _Lausane_,
    Qu’on ne scaura l’origine du fait,
    L’on mettra hors toute la gent loingtaine,
    Feu veu au Ciel peuple estranger deffait.

    English.

    A great stink shall come forth out of _Lausane_,
    So that no body shall know the ofspring of it,
    They shall put out all the Forreiners,
    Fire seen in Heaven, a strange people defeated.

ANNOT.

_Lausane_ is a City situated in _Savoy_, by the Lake of _Geneva_, but now
as I take it in the possession of the _Switzers_.


XI.

    French.

    Peuple infiny paroistre a _Vicence_,
    Sans force feu brusler la _Basilique_,
    Pres de _Lunage_ des fait grand de _Valence_,
    Lors que _Venise_ par morte prendre pique.

    English.

    Infinite deal of people shall appear at _Vicence_,
    Without force, fire shall burn in the _Basilick_,
    Near _Lunage_ the great one of _Valence_ shall be defeated,
    When _Venice_ by death shall take the pique.

ANNOT.

_Vicenza_ is a Town in _Italy_, under the dominion of the _Venetians_.
_Basilick_ is the name of the biggest sort of Canons or pieces of
Ordinance. As for _Valence_ there is three Cities of that name, one in
_Spain_, the second in _France_, and the third in _Italy_; instead of
_Lunage_, it must be _Lignago_ which is a Town in _Italy_.


XII.

    French.

    Apparoistra aupres du _Bufalore_,
    L’haut & procere entré dedans _Milan_,
    L’Abbé de _Foix_ avec ceux de Saint _Maure_,
    Feront la fourbe habillez en vilain.

    English.

    Near the _Bufalore_ shall appear,
    The high and tall, come into _Milan_,
    The Abbot of _Foix_ with those of Saint _Maure_,
    Shall make the trumpery being cloathed like rogues.

ANNOT.

_Bufalore_ is a barbarous word; _Foix_ is a Countrey in _France_, and St.
_Maure_ a little Town in the said Countrey.


XIII.

    French.

    Le croisé Frere par amour effrenée,
    Fera par _Praytus_ _Bellerophon_ mourir,
    Classe a mil ans, la femme forcenée,
    Beu le breueage, tous deux apres perir.

    English.

    The crossed Brother through unbridled love,
    Shall cause _Bellerophon_ to be killed by _Praytus_,
    Fleet to thousand years, the woman out of her wit,
    The drink being drunk, both after that, perish.

ANNOT.

_Bellerophon_ and _Praytus_ are two supposed and fictitious names.


XIV.

    French.

    Le grand credit, d’or, d’argent l’abundance,
    Aveuglera par _Libide_ l’honneur,
    Cogneu sera d’adultere l’offence,
    Qui parviendra a son grand deshonneur.

    English.

    The great credit, the abundance of Gold and Silver
    Shall blind honour by lust,
    The offence of the Adulterer shall be known,
    Which shall come to his great dishonour.

ANNOT.

This is easie to be understood; for it is frequently seen, that Honour is
made blind by lust, and chiefly if that lust be propped up with credit;
and abundance of Gold and Silver.


XV.

    French.

    Vers Aquilon grands efforts par hommasse,
    Presque l’_Europe_, l’Univers vexer,
    Les deux Eclipses mettra en telle chassé,
    Et aux _Pannons_ vie & mort renforcer.

    English.

    Towards the North great endeavours by a manly woman,
    To trouble _Europe_, and almost all the world,
    She shall put to flight the two Eclipses,
    And shall re-inforce life and death to the _Pannons_.

ANNOT.

By the _Pannons_ is meant the _Hungarians_. The rest is easie.


XVI.

    French.

    Au lieu que _Hieson_ fit sa nef fabriquer,
    Si grand Deluge sera & si subite,
    Qu’on n’aura lieu ne Terre sattaquer,
    L’onde monter _Fesulan Olympique_.

    English.

    In the place where _Jason_ caused his Ship to be built,
    So great a Flood shall be, and so sudden,
    That there shall be neither place nor Land to save themselves,
    The Waves shall climb upon the _Olympick Fesulan_.

ANNOT.

_Jason_ was Son to King _Æson_, who built a Ship called _Argos_, in which
he went to _Colchos_, to Conquer the Golden Fleece.

_Fesulan_ here is to be understood of some high and eminent place, which
therefore he calleth _Olympick_, from _Olympus_ a high Mountain in
_Grecia_. The place where _Jason_ builded his Ship.


XVII.

    French.

    Les bien aisez subit seront desmis,
    Le monde mis par les trois freres en trouble,
    Cité Marine saisiront ennemis,
    Faim, feu, sang, peste, & de tous maux le double.

    English.

    Those that were at ease shall be put down,
    The world shall be put in trouble by three Brothers,
    The Maritine City shall be seized by its enemies,
    Hunger, fire, blood, plague, and the double of all evils.

ANNOT.

It is not easie to tell what them three Brothers have been, or shall be,
nor that Maritine or Sea City, therefore we leave it to the liberty of
every ones judgement, the words being plain enough.


XVIII.

    French.

    De _Flore_ issue de sa mort sera cause,
    Un temps devant par jeusne & vieille bueyre,
    Car les trois lis luy feront telle pause,
    Par son fruit sauve comme chair crüe mueyre.

    English.

    Issued from _Flora_ shall be the cause of her own death,
    One time before, through fasting and old drink,
    For the three Lillies shall make her such a pause,
    Saved by her fruit, as raw flesh dead.

ANNOT.

This is one of those, wherein the Author would not be understood, and may
be did not understand himself.


XVIX.

    French.

    A soustenir la grand cappe troublée,
    Pour l’esclaireir les rouges marcheront,
    De mort famille sera presqu’accablée,
    Les rouges rouges, le rouge assommeront.

    English.

    To maintain up the great troubled Cloak,
    The red ones shall march for to clear it,
    A family shall be almost crushed to death,
    The red, the red, shall knock down the red one.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to carry no other sense than a conspiracy of the Cardinals,
called here by the name of the _Red_, the _Red_ against the Pope, who is
called the _Red one_.


XX.

    French.

    Le faux message par election feinte,
    Courir par Urbem rompue pache arreste,
    Voix acheptées de sang chappelle teinte,
    Et a un autre qui l’Empire conteste.

    English.

    The contract broken, stoppeth the message,
    From going about the Town, by a fained election,
    Voices shall be bought, and a Chappel died with blood,
    By another, who challengeth the Empire.

ANNOT.

This was so falsely printed, and so preposterously set in order, that I
had much ado to pick out this little sense of it, which amounteth to no
more, than that by reason of an agreement broken, the Messenger, that
went to publish a faigned election (it seemeth of the Empire) shall be
hindred, and that one of the Competitors to the said Empire, shall be
killed in or near a Chappel, that shall be soiled by his Blood.


XXI.

    French.

    Au port de _Agde_ trois fustes entreront,
    Portant infection avec soy, pestilence,
    Passant le pont mil milles embleront,
    Et le pont rompre a tierce resistance.

    English.

    Three Galleys shall come into the harbour of _Agde_,
    Carrying with them infection and Pestilence,
    Going beyond the Bridge, they shall carry away thousands,
    At the third resistance the Bridge shall be broken.

ANNOT.

_Agde_ is a Sea Town in _France_ upon the _Mediterranean_ Sea, which is
threatned here of three Galleys, that shall come into the Harbour of
it, and shall bring with them infection and Plague; and besides carry
away thousands of Captives, by which it seemeth, that these should be
_Turkish_ Galleys, till at last upon the third resistance of the Townsmen
the Bridge shall be broken.


XXII.

    French.

    _Gorsan_, _Narbonne_, par le Sel advertir,
    _Tucham_, la Grace _Perpignan_ trahie,
    La ville rouge ny voudra consentir,
    Par haute _Voldrap_, Gris vie faillie.

    English.

    To _Tucham_, the Grace _Perpignan_ betrayed,
    The red Town will not give consent to it,
    By high _Woldrap_, Gray, life ended.

ANNOT.

This is another, wherein my best skill faileth me; for take away
_Narbonne_, which is a City of _France_, in the Province of _Languedoc_,
and _Perpignan_, which is another in the County of _Roussilon_ near
_Spain_. The rest are either barbarous words or nonsensical to me.

understood.

    Shall cause the Dame to be ravished in the Brook,
    The lascivious shall counterfeit half a discontent,
    The Father shall deprive the bodies of both of their souls.

ANNOT.

This signifieth nothing but a Lover, who meeting in or by a Brook, his
Mistress shall enjoy her, for which she shall fain a little discontent,
as if she had been ravished against her will, but her jealous Father not
contented therewith, shall kill them both, which is an ordinary _Italian_
trick.

    Put discovered, place soil and ruine,
    The great that hold will not _Pampelona_,
    By the Abbaye of _Montferrat_, mist.

ANNOT.

_Barcelona_ is a Town of a Province in _Spain_, called _Catalonia_.
_Pampelona_ is the chief Town of the Kingdom of _Navarre_. _Montferrat_
is an Abbaye in the Mountains of _Catalonia_; the rest is insignificant.

    Which after the rape were thrown into the Lake and fire,

afterwards thrown into a Lake and a fire, which fire being put out, those
Idols were found, and the memorial engraven in Marble.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth, that at the fourth Pillar of a Temple that was
dedicated to _Saturn_, which Pillar shall be split by an Earth-quake
and a Flood, there shall be found an Urne, (which is an Earthen Vessel,
wherein the ancient _Romans_ used to keep the ashes of their dead
friends) full of gold, that shall be carried away, and then restored.

    Digging a Well, for the Pallace of spectacle,
    A treasure found that shall vex every one,
    In two parcels, in, and near the _Basacle_.

ANNOT.

_Tholose_ is the chief City of _Languedoc_, _Beluzer_ is a private place
within its precinct, Spectacle is insignificant, and is onely foisted in,
to Rime with _Basacle_, which is a place in _Tholose_, where there is
aboundance of Water-mills, that make a hideous and fearful noise.

    The first great fruit the Prince of _Pesquiere_,
    But he shall become very cruel and malicious,
    He shall loose his fierce pride in _Venice_,
    And shall be put to evil by the younger _Celin_.

ANNOT.

_Pescaire_ is a Town in the Kingdom of _Naples_, belonging to the noble
_Spanish_ Family of _Avalos_, of which it seemeth one shall prove cruel
and malicious; but he shall be killed in _Venice_ by one young _Celin_,
by which formerly, and in other places the Author understandeth the
_Turk_.

accompanied with nine others, shall cause his Son to be murdered when he
went about some venereal employment.

    Who shall bear a very unworthy surname,
    Who shall endeavour at _Venice_ to avenge himself,
    But he shall be taken by a Watch-man.

ANNOT.

_Verona_ and _Vicenza_ are two famous Cities in _Italy_, under the
dominion of the _Venetians_; the rest is easie.

    _Lyons_, Ulme fall dead at _Mausol_.

ANNOT.

The Mount _Jura_ is in _Switzerland_; _Lyon_ is a great City in _France_;
and _Ulme_ another in _Germany_; the rest is either barbarous or
insignificant.

    Within the entrance of _Garonne_ and _Blaye_,
    And the Forrest not far from _Damazan_,
    Of _Marsaves_ frosts, then Hail and North wind,
    _Dordonois_ frozen by the error of _Mezan_.

ANNOT.

_Garonne_ is the River that runneth at _Bourdeaux_, and _Blaye_ is the
Port Town that lieth at the mouth of it; I should think that instead
of _Dordonois_, it should be Printed _Dordone_, which is another River
thereabouts, and is here threatned to be frozen.

would undertake this.

    English.

    The King of _Blois_ in _Avignon_ shall Reign
    Another time the people do murmur,
    He shall cause in the _Rhosne_ to be bathed through the Walls,
    As many as five, the last shall be near _Nole_.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth that a King of _France_ shall take _Avignon_, which is
a City in _France_ belonging to the Pope. And that some of the people
beginning to murmur and mutiny, he shall cause five of them to be thrown
over the Walls into the _Rhosne_, which is a swift River that passeth by.
_Nole_ must be some place thereabouts.


XXXIX.

    French.

    English.

    What shall have been by a _Bizantin_ Prince,
    Shall be taken away by the Prince of _Tholose_,
    The faith of _Foix_ by the chief _Tholentin_,
    Shall fail him, not refusing the Spouse.

ANNOT.

I can understand nothing else by Prince _Bizantin_, but some Prince of
the house of _Gonzague_, who derive their pedigree from that of the
_Palæologues_, formerly Emperours of _Constantinople_, called in ancient
time _Bizantium_. As for the Prince of _Tholose_, there having been none
this two or three hundred years since that Country was devolved to the
Crown of _France_; but the King himself, I suppose he must be understood
here; so that the sense of this Prophecie, (if any be) is, that the King
of _France_ shall take something from the Duke of _Mantua_, who is the
head of the _Gonzagues_, as he hath done formerly several times.

By the faith of _Foix_, is understood the late Duke of _Rohan_, who
descended from the house of _Foix_, and who did war against the said
Duke of _Mantua_ at that time, when the King of _France_, _Lewis_ XIII.
would not suffer his Brother the Duke of _Orleans_ to Marry the Princess
_Mary_, Daughter of the Duke of _Nevers_, of the house of _Gonzague_, and
lately Queen of _Poland_.

    English.

    The blood of the just by _Taur_ and _Dorade_,
    To avenge themselves against the _Saturnins_,
    In the new Lake shall sink the _Mainade_,
    Then shall go forth against the _Albanins_.

ANNOT.

Here the Author hath kept his mind to himself, as for my part, being
ignorant of his barbarous words, I had rather leave the sense of this
to the judgment of the Reader, than by an incongruous and far fetched
interpretation make my self ridiculous.


XLI.

    French.

    Esleu sera Renard ne sonnant mot,
    Faisant le Saint public, vivant pain d’orge,
    Tyranniser apres tant a un cop,
    Mettant le pied des plus grands sur la gorge.

    English.

    A Fox shall be elected that said nothing,
    Making a publick Saint, living with Barley bread,
    Shall tyrannise after upon a sudden,
    And put his foot upon the Throat of the greatest.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy seemeth to regard particularly the Pope, who having played
the Hypocrite before his Election, eating nothing but Barley bread, that
he might be reputed a Spaint, shall after his Election shall tyrannise
upon a sudden, and trample upon the Throat of the greatest Monarchs, as
they have done formerly, and would do yet if they could.


XLII.

    French.

    Par avarice, par force & violence,

    Prez Saint _Memire_ assaut & resistance,
    Mort dans sa Tente, diront quil dort leans.

    English.

    By avarice, by force and violence,
    Shall come to vex his own chief of _Orleans_,
    Near Saint _Memire_ assault and resistance,
    Dead in his Tent, they’l say he sleepeth there.

ANNOT.

The construction of this must be thus made. The Chiefs of _Orleans_,
(which is a famous Town in _France_) shall come to vex their own (I
suppose) Citizens. And near that place called Saint _Memire_, shall be a
fight, where one of those chief ones shall be killed, or die in his Tent,
and shall be denyed under pretence of being asleep.


XLIII.

    French.

    Par le decide de deux choses Bastars,
    Nepveu du sang occupera le Regne,
    Dedans _Lectoure_ seront les coups de dards,
    Nepveu par peur pleira l’Enseigne.

    English.

    By the decision of two things, Bastards,
    Nephew of the Blood shall occupy the Kingdom,
    Within _Lectoure_ shall be strokes of Darts,
    Nephew through fear shall fold up his Ensign.

ANNOT.

I think that instead of decision it should be division, and then the
sense is easily made up, thus; that through the division of two Bastards,
the Nephew of the Blood shall occupy the Kingdom, which Nephew afterwards
in a fight at _Lectoure_, (which is a strong Town in _Gascony_) shall be
put to the worst, and compelled to fold up his Ensigns.


XLIV.

    French.

    Le procrée naturel d’_Ogmion_,
    De sept a neuf du chemin destourner,

    English.

    The natural begotten of _Ogmyon_,
    From seven to nine shall put out of the way,
    To King of long, and friend to the half man,
    Ought to _Navarre_ prostrate the fort of _Pau_.

ANNOT.

A man needeth a good pair of Spectacles to see through all this, what I
understand in it is that this Bastard of _Ogmyon_, by whom he meaneth the
King of _France_, ought to submit the Fort of _Pau_ to _Navarre_, and
good reason too; for _Navarre_ is the Kingdom, and _Pau_ only the chief
Town of one Province of it, called _Bearn_.


XLV.

    French.

    La main escharpe & la jambe bandée,
    _Louis_ puisné de _Palais_ partira,
    Au mot du guet la mort sera tardée,
    Puis dans le Temple a Pasques seignera.

    English.

    The hand on a Scarf, and the leg swadled,
    The younger _Lewis_ shall go from _Palais_,
    At the Watch word his death shall be protracted,
    Then afterwards at _Easter_ he shall bleed in the Temple.

ANNOT.

The Prince of _Condé_, whose name was _Lewis_, and the youngest of the
Children of _Charles_ of _Bourbon_, the first Duke of _Vendosme_, father
to _Anthony_ of _Bourbon_, King of _Navarre_, went away from the Court in
the time of _Francis_ the second King of _France_, and came into _Bearn_
to the King his Brother. He was summoned many times by _Francis_ II. to
come to Court; but finding his name to be amongst those that intended to
surprise _Lion_, he durst not venture.

Nevertheless he was perswaded by his Uncle the Cardinal of _Bourbon_, and
came to the Court at _Orleans_. It is easie to believe that he fained
himself to be hurt by a fall from his Horse, or that really he was so;
_having his Arm in a Scarf, and his Leg swadled up_, in which posture he
came to testifie his obedience to the Kings commands.

In this posture of a wounded man, whether really and fictitiously he came
from _Palais_, which by mistake is printed _Calais_; the Printer being
ignorant, that in _Bearn_, where the Prince had sheltered himself, there
is a Castle called _Palais_, which was the place that the Prince used to
live in.

Being come to Court he was presently arrested, arraigned and condemned to
death. Nevertheless the Kings sickness proving mortal, the execution was
suspended, and his life saved. After that the Prince sought all occasions
to revenge himself, and began about _Easter_ in _April_ following. It
was not by an open Rebellion against the King, but under pretence to
maintain the Protestant Religion: therefore the Author saith, _that this
life saved shall bleed in the Temple_; because the Princes pretext was
the Temple and the Church; that is Religion. Hence the fourth Verse is
clearly understood. Resteth the third Verse, which saith, that his life
was differred till the _Watch word_; because the Queen seeing the King
her Son upon his death bed, caused secretly the execution of the Sentence
to be differred, that she might make use of the King of _Navarre_, and
of the Prince his Brothers favour, against the house of _Guise_, for the
obtaining of the Regency.

Moreover I observe, that in the year 1562. the Prince of _Condé_ began
openly to rebel, surprising the City of _Orleans_ the 29 of _March_,
which was _Easter day_ that year, which sheweth the truth of the fourth
Verse.


XLVI.

    French.

    _Pol Mensolée_ mourra trois lieues du _Rhosne_,
    Fuis les deux prochains _Tarare_ destrois,
    Car _Mars_ sera le plus horrible Throsne,
    De Coq & d’Aigle, de _France_ frere trois.

    English.

    _Paul Mensolée_ Shall die three Leagues from the _Rhosne_,
    Avoid the two straights near the _Tarare_;
    For _Mars_ shall keep such a horrible throsne,
    Of Cock and Eagle, of _France_ three Brothers.

ANNOT.

By this _Pol Mensolée_, he meaneth some proper name. _Tarare_ is a great
Mountain near the City of _Lions_, that hath two principal ways to go
through, which here he calleth Straights; for indeed they are very
dangerous for Thieves and Murderers. The rest is but a threating of War
between the Emperour and _France_, when there shall be three Brothers in
_France_.


XLVII.

    French.

    Lac _Trasmenien_ portera tesmoignage,
    Des conjurez ferrez dedans _Perouse_,
    Un _Despolle_ contrefera le sage,
    Tuant _Tedesque_ de _Sterne_ & _Minuse_.

    English.

    _Trasmenian_ Lake shall bear witness
    Of the Conspirators shut up in _Perugia_,
    A _Despolle_ shall counterfeit the wise,
    Killing _Tedesque_ of _Sterne_ and _Minuse_.

ANNOT.

I think that the Impression is false here; for instead of _Despolle_,
which is a barbarous word, and signifieth nothing, I would have it in
_French_ _Despoville_, in _English_ robbed of all; so that _Trasmenian_
Lake is that Lake in _Italy_ not far from the Town of _Perugia_, where
_Hannibal_ gave that notable overthrow to the _Romans_, and killed above
20000. of them, with their consul _Flaminius_.

That man whom he calleth here robbed of all, shall kill some _Germans_;
for _Tudesco_ in _Italian_, is a _German_, the two last words are
barbarous.


XLVIII.

    French.

    _Saturne_ en _Cancer_, _Jupiter_ avec _Mars_,
    Dedans _Fevrier_ _Caldondon_, _Salvaterre_,

    English.

    _Saturn_ in _Cancer_, _Jupiter_ with _Mars_,
    In _February_ _Caldondon_, _Salvaterre_,
    _Sault_, _Castalon_, assaulted on three sides,
    Near _Verbiesque_, fight and mortal War.

ANNOT.

The multiplicity of barbarous and insignificant words, makes this
incapable of any construction, if any body will exercise his wit
thereupon, I shall willingly lend him my ear.


XLIX.

    French.

    _Satur_ au Bœuf, _Jove_ en l’Eau, _Mars_ en fleche,
    Six de _Fevrier_ mortalité donra,
    Ceux de _Tardaigne_ a _Bruges_ si grand breche
    Qu’a _Ponterose_ chef _Barbarin_ mourra.

    English.

    _Satur_ in Ox, _Jupiter_ in water, _Mars_ in arrow,
    The sixth of _February_ shall give mortality,
    Those of _Tardaigne_ shall make in _Bruges_ so great a breach,
    That the chief _Barbarin_ shall die at _Pontrose_.

ANNOT.

_Satur in Ox_; that is, _Saturn_ in _Taurus_, _Jupiter in Water_; that
is, _Jupiter_ in _Aquarius_; _Mars in arrow_, is _Mars_ in _Sagitarius_;
when these things shall happen. _The sixth day of ~February~ shall bring
a great mortality._ _Tardaigne_ is a fictitious name, unless he intended
_Sardaigne_. _Bruges_ is a Town in _Flander_, _Ponterose_ is some
place, where he saith, that the chief _Barbarin_ shall die, the chief
Barbare was the Pope _Urban_ the eighth; but because I do not know the
particularities of his death, and the place of it, I cannot make the rest
good.


L.

    La Pestilence lentour de _Capadille_,

    English.

    The Plague shall be round about _Capadille_,
    Another famine cometh near to that of _Sagunce_,
    The Knight Bastard of the good old man,
    Shall cause the great one of _Tunis_ to be beheaded.

ANNOT.

The difficulty here, is what is meant by that word _Cappadille_, for my
part I think he meaneth _Italy_, for some times the _Italians_ use by way
of admiration to say _Capoli_, or _Capadillo_. _Sagunce_ is a Town in
_Spain_, which for the love of the _Carthaginians_ withstood the _Romans_
a great while, till they were brought to an extremity of famine, and then
set fire in their Town.

    The _Bizantin_, making an offering,
    After he hath taken _Cordua_ to himself again,
    His way long, rest, contemplation,
    Crossing the Sea hath taken a prey by _Cologne_.

ANNOT.

This is an express delineation of _Charles_ the V. Empire, who at the
latter end of his days retired into a Monastery, reserving unto himself
for his subsistance the revenue of the Kingdom of _Castille_, expressed
here by _Cordua_, which is a City of _Spain_.

    English.

    The King of _Blois_ shall Reign in _Avignon_,
    He shall come from _Amboise_ and _Seme_, along the _Linder_,
    A Nail at _Poitiers_ shall ruine the Holy Wings,
    Before _Bony_.

ANNOT.

The first Verse and the interpretation is easie.

_Amboise_ is a Town in _France_ upon the River of _Loire_.

The two last Verses being inperfect, admits of no interpretation, onely
to let the Reader know that _Poitiers_ is a very great City in _France_,
and Capital of the Province of _Poitou_.


LIII.

    Dedans _Boulogne_ voudra laver ses fautes,

    English.

    He shall desire to wash his faultes in _Bulloin_,
    In the Church of the Sun, but he shall not be able,
    He shall fly doing so high things,
    That the like was never in _Hierarchy_.

ANNOT.

There is two Towns called _Bolloin_, one is in _Italy_, the other in
_France_, the last is that which is meant here; for Cardinal _Richelieu_
who is the man that did so high things, and the like of which was never
in _Hierarchy_ (that is in the Clergy) a little afore his death had vowed
if he recovered his health to go in Pilgrimage to _Bulloin_, where there
is a famous Temple for Miracles, (as they say) dedicated to our Lady,
which is called here the Sun, by an allusion to that passage of the
Revelation: _And there appeared a Woman cloathed with the Sun_; but the
said Cardinal was prevented by death.

    Soubs la couleur du traité mariage,
    Fait magnanime par grand _Chiren Selin_,
    _Quintin_, _Arras_, recouvrez au voiage,
    D’_Espagnols_ fait second banc _Macelin_.

    English.

    Under pretence of a Treaty of Marriage,
    A Magnanimous act shall be done by the great _Cheiren Selin_,
    _Quintin_, _Arras_ recovered in the journey,
    Of _Spaniards_ shall be made a second _Macelin_ Bench.

ANNOT.

This is a Prognostication concerning a King of _France_, meant here by
the great _Cheiren Selin_, who under pretence of a Treaty of Marriage,
shall recover in his journey these two Towns Saint _Quintin_ and _Arras_,
for the Shambles are called in Latine _Macellum_. _Quod ibi mactentur
pectora quæ mercatoribus venundantur._


LV.

    French.

    Entre deux Fleuves se verra enserré,
    Tonneaux & caques unis a passer outre,
    Huit Pont rompus chef a tant enferré,
    Enfans parfaits sont jugulez en coultre.

    English.

    Between two Rivers he shall find himself shut up,
    Tuns and Barrels put together to pass over,
    Eight Bridges broken, the chief at last in Prison,
    Compleat children shall have their throat cut.

ANNOT.

It is an accident that hath often happened to a Commander of an Army,
to find himself either by his own oversight, or by the policy of his
enemies, shut up between two Rivers, having upon neither of them a Bridge
at his command; as it did happen once to the Prince of _Condé_, the
Grandfather of this, in the time of the Civil war for Religion, who was
forced by it to dissolve his Army, and bid every one shift for himself,
so that they almost all escaped by several small parties, some going one
way some another, at such time it is an ordinary shift to make use of
empty Vessels and Caskes to make a Bridge, as our Author doth mention
here.


LVI.

    French.

    La bande foible la Terre occupera,
    Ceux du haut lieu feront horribles cris,
    Le gros troupeau d’estre coin troublera,
    Tombe pres _D. nebro_ descouvert les escrits.

    English.

    The weak party shall occupy the ground,
    Those of the high places shall make fearful cries,
    It shall trouble the great flock in the right corner,
    He falleth near _D. nebro_ discovereth the writings.

ANNOT.

I dare not comment upon this, for fear it should be said of me, what was
said of the Glose of _Accurtius_; _obscura per obscurius_.


LVII.

    French.

    De Soldat simple parviendra en Empire,
    De Robe courte parviendra a la longue,
    Vaillant aux Armes, en Eglise ou plus pire,
    Vexer les Prestres comme l’eau fait l’esponge.

    English.

    From a simple Souldier he shall come to have the supreme command,
    From a short Gown he shall come to the long one,
    Vaillant in Arms, no worse man in the Church,
    He shall vex the Priests, as water doth a Spunge.

ANNOT.

I never knew nor heard of any body to whom this Stanza might be better
applied, then to the late Usurper _Cromwel_, for from a simple Souldier,
he became to be Lord Protector, and from a Student in the University he
became a graduate in _Oxford_, he was valliant in Arms, and the worse
Churchman that could be found; as for vexing the Priests, I mean the
Prelatical Clergy, I believe none went beyond him.


LVIII.

    French.

    Regne en querelle aux freres divisé,
    Prendre les Armes & les nom _Britannique_,
    Tiltre _Anglican_ sera tard advisé,
    Surprins de nuit, mener a l’air _Gallique_.

    English.

    A Kingdom in dispute, and divided between the Brothers,
    To take the Arms and the _Britannick_ name,
    And the _English_ title, he shall advise himself late,
    Surprised in the night and carried into the _French_ air.

ANNOT.

This prognosticateth a great division in _England_ between Brothers,
about the Title and Kingdom of _England_, insomuch, that in conclusion
one shall be surprised by night, and carried away into _France_.


LIX.

    French.

    Par deux fois haut, par deux fois mis a bas,
    L’Orient aussi l’Occident foiblira,
    Son adversaire apres plusieurs combats,
    Par Mer chassé au besoin faillira.

    English.

    Twice set up high, and twice brought down,
    The East also the West shall weaken,
    His adversary after many fights,
    Expelled by Sea, shall fail in need.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth of some considerable person, who shall be twice set up,
and brought down again. The second Verse is pronounced after the manner
of the old Oracles, as

    _Aio te Æacida Romanos vincere posse_,

For no body can tell here whither the East shall weaken the West, or
otherways. The last two Verses are easie.


LX.

    French.

    Premier en _Gaule_, premier en _Romanie_,
    Par Mer & Terre aux _Anglois_ & _Paris_,
    Merveilleux faits par cette grand mesgnie,
    Violant, _Terax_ perdra le _Norlaris_.

    English.

    The first in _France_, the first in _Romania_,
    By Sea and Land to the _English_ and _Paris_,
    Wonderful deeds by that great company,
    By ravishing, _Terax_ shall spoil the _Norlaris_.

ANNOT.

The first in _France_ is the King, the first in _Romania_ is the _Pope_,
who it seemeth shall joyn together by Sea and Land, and come against
_Paris_, who shall call the _English_ to its help, insomuch, that strange
deeds shall be done by that great company. As for _Terax_, it seemeth to
be the proper name of some man, who by ravishing a woman called here the
_Norlaris_, shall spoil her and cause sad consequences. _Norlaris_ by
transposition of Letters is _Lorrain_.


LXI.

    French.

    Jamais par le decouvrement du jour,
    Ne parviendra au signe Sceptrifere,
    Que tous Sieges ne soient en sejour,
    Portant au Coq don du _Tag_ a misere.

    English.

    Never by the discovering of the day,
    He shall attain to the Sceptriferous sign,
    Till all his seats be settled,
    Carrying to the Cock a gift from the _Tag_ to misery.

ANNOT.

This signifieth that one pretending to a Kingdom, shall never attain to
it by often removing his place, until all his seats be settled, that is,
untill his wandring be ceased. And a gift brought by him to the King of
_France_ from _Portugal_, signified here by the _Tag_, which is the River
of _Lisbon_ the Capital City of it, from which gift shall proceed misery.


LXII.

    French.

    Lors qu’on verra expiler le Saint Temple,
    Plus grand du _Rhosne_, & sacres prophaner:
    Par eux naistra pestilence si grande,
    Roy fait injuste ne sera condamner.

    English.

    When one shall see spoiled the Holy Temple,
    The greatest of the _Rhosne_, and sacred things prophaned,
    from them shall come so great a pestilence,
    That the King being unjust shall not condemn them.

ANNOT.

The greatest Temple of the _Rhosne_, is that of the City of _Lion_,
which is seated upon that River of _Rhosne_, which when it shall be
robbed and spoiled, then shall come a horrid Pestilence, which our Author
attributeth to the injustice of the King then Reigning, who shall neglect
to punish those Sacriledges.


LXIII.

    French.

    Quand l’adultere blessé sans coup aura,
    Meurdry la femme & le fils par depit,
    Femme assomée l’Enfant estranglera,
    Huit captifs prins sestoufer sans respit.

    English.

    When the Adulterer wounded without a blow,
    Shall have murdered the wife and son by spight,
    The woman knocked down, shall strangle the child,
    Eight taken prisoners, and stifled without tarrying.

ANNOT.

This is the description of a sad Tragedy, which to understand, you must
joyn all the Verses together, and make it one sense. The Adulterer
wounded without a blow, is one that shall get a disease, (suppose the
_Pox_) his wife finding fault with it, he shall murder her, and her
Son; she not being quite dead shall strangle another Child (which it
seemeth she had by this Adulterer) and for this fact eight shall be taken
prisoners and immediately hanged, by which you must suppose the fact to
be done in _France_, for there they Judge and Hang immediately, whereby
in _England_ they must stay till Sessions-time.


LXIV.

    French.

    Dedans les Isles les enfans transportez,
    Les deux de sept seront en desespoir,
    Ceux de terrouer en seront supportez,
    _Nompelle_ prins, des ligues fuy l’espoir.

    English.

    In the Islands the Children shall be transported,
    The two of seven shall be in despair,
    Those of the Countrey shall be supported by,
    _Nompelle_ taken, avoid the hope of the League.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to have a great relation to our late unhappy troubles in
_England_, when the Princess _Elizabeth_ and the Duke of _Glocester_
were transported into the Isle of _Wight_, which are the two of the
seven, (for the Queen hath had seven children) and the Kings Majesty and
his Highness the Duke of _York_, were driven into the _Low-Countreis_,
being in a manner in dispair of ever coming again, and those Countreys
were much the better for the harbouring of them; in the last Verse by
_Nompelle_ I understand Anagrammatically _Monpelier_, which being taken,
there is no more hope in the League, as it did happen in the time of
_Henry_ the IV. King of _France_, who never saw the League or Covenant
quite routed, till that Town was taken; for it is familiar enough to
those kind of Prophets to make an ὕστερον πρώτερον, and joyn things past,
to those that are to come, to darken the Readers understanding, and as
the Scripture saith, _Ut videntes non videant_.


LXV.

    French.

    Le vieux frustré du principal espoir,
    Il parviendra au chef de son Empire,
    Vingt mois tiendra le Regne a grand pouvoir,
    Tyran, cruel en delaissant un pire.

    English.

    The old man frustrated of his chief hope,
    He shall attain to the head of his Empire,
    Twenty months he shall keep the Kingdom with great power,
    Tyrant, cruel, and having a worse one.

ANNOT.

The words of this Prophecy are plain enough, and because I cannot learn
in History that such things have come to pass yet, therefore I reckon it
among those _de futuro_.


LXVI.

    French.

    Quand l’Escriture D. M. trouvée,
    Et Cave antique a Lampe descouverte,
    Loy, Roy, & Prince _Vlpian_ esprouvée,
    Pavillon, Royne & Duc soubs la couverte.

    English.

    When the writing D. M. shall be found,
    And an ancient Cave discovered with a Lamp,
    Law, King, and Prince _Ulpian_ tried,
    Tent, Queen and Duke under the rugge.

ANNOT.

In the year 1555. _Ferdinand Alvaro_ of _Toledo_ Duke of _Alba_, being
sent by _Charles_ the V. into _Italy_ to resist the _French_, arrived in
_June_ at _Milan_, and having gathered together, all his Forces, Besieged
the Town St. _Jago_, but _Henry_ II. King of _France_ sending some
succours by the Duke of _Aumale_, he raised up his siege, and put his
Army into Garrisons. The Duke of _Alba_ leaving the Field in this manner,
the Duke of _Aumale_ besieged _Vulpian_, wherein were 1000. souldiers
in Garrison, under the command of _Cæsar_ of _Naples_, besides the
Inhabitants. Never was a place so furiously assaulted, and so manfully
defended, so that the _French_ were many times beaten back; but at last
after 24. days siege the Duke of _Aumale_ did gloriously take it.

The Author foretelling the time of this victory, said it was when the
writing D. M. in big letters was found, that is to say, about the 11. of
_September_ after the Equinox, because in the Ephemerides, the Meridional
descension of the Planets, and chiefly of _Sol_, _Venus_, and _Mercury_
is marked with these two Letters D. M. which descension cometh to pass
after the Equinox of _Autumn_ towards the end of _September_. At the
same time was discovered an ancient Cave, wherein was found one of those
Lamps, that cannot be put out, and burns continually without any addition
of Oil, by an invention that is lost. Such another was found in the time
of _Alexander_ the VI. and _Adrian_ the VI.

The Town of _Vulpian_ was at that time tried by a King and a Prince,
_viz._ _Henry_ the II. and the Duke of _Aumale_ Prince of _Lorrain_, and
Brother to the Cardinal of _Lorrain_, and to the Duke of _Guise_.

The Author addeth, that besides these three things, _viz._ the finding
of the letters D. M. The Cave discovered the siege of _Vulpian_; there
happened a fourth one, _viz._ that a Queen and a Duke should consult
together in a Summer-house, about the important affairs of the Kingdom.
To understand this, we must suppose that Pope _Paul_ the IV. willing to
secure his own person and the Ecclesiastical State against the _Spanish_
faction, and that of the _Colonese_, did seize upon many places belonging
to the said _Colonese_, and knowing besides that the _Spaniards_ being
of the _Coloneses_ party, would not fail to come upon him, he disposed
the King of _France_ to come to his succours, so that the Queen having a
particular confidence in the Duke of _Guise_, did consult with him about
this business in some Summer-house, which the _French_ call a _Pavillon_.


LXVII.

    French.

    _Par._ _Car._ _nersaf_, a ruine grand discorde,
    Ne l’un ne l’autre n’aura election,
    _Nersaf_ du peuple aura amour & concorde,
    _Ferrare_, _Collonne_ grande protection.

    English.

    _Par._ _Car._ _Nersaf_, to ruine great discord,
    Neither one nor the other shall be Elected,
    _Nersaf_, shall have of the people love and concord,
    _Ferrare_, _Colonna_, great protection.

ANNOT.

It is very hard to say what the Author meaneth by these disjunctives
_Par._ _Car._ _Nersaf_, all what can be gathered by what follows, is,
that there shall be a great variance and strife about an Election, (I
suppose of a Pope as it useth to be) and that _Nersaf_ shall have the
good will of the people, and yet none of them shall be Elected.

As for the fourth Verse, it is to be noted first that _Ferrara_ is a
strong Town in _Italy_ belonging to the Pope, and _Colonna_ is the
name of the chief Family in _Rome_, now whether _Ferrara_ shall be a
protection to _Colonna_, or _Colonna_ to _Ferrara_, we leave it to the
Reader to judge, because the Verse hath a double sense.


LXVIII.

    French.

    Vieux Cardinal par le jeune deceu,
    Hors de sa charge se verra desarmé,
    _Arles_ ne monstres double fort apperceu,
    Et l’_Aqueduct_ & le Prince embaumé.

    English.

    An old Cardinal shall be cheated by a young one,
    And shall see himself out of his imployment,
    _Arles_ do not show, a double fort perceived,
    And the _Aqueduct_, and the embalmed Prince.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are very plain, the two last not so; therefore
observe that _Arles_ is a City in _France_, in the Countrey of _Dauphine_
or _Provence_, famous for antiquity, which is forwarned here not to shew
its Fords, nor its Aqueducts, (which are buildings to convey water), nor
its embalmed Prince, which it seemeth lyeth thereabout buried. The Author
hath deprived here the Author of the reasons for why.


LXIX.

    French.

    Aupres du jeune se vieux Ange baiser,
    Et le viendra surmonter a la fin,
    Dix ans esgaux aux plus vieux rabaisser,
    De trois deux l’un huitiesme _Seraphin_.

    English.

    Near the young one the old Angel shall bowe,
    And shall at last overcome him,
    Ten years equal, to make the old one stoop,
    Of three, two, one, the eighth a _Seraphin_.

ANNOT.

This is the description of a grand Cheat, when an old man called here
Angel, shall stoop before a young one, whom he shall overcome at last,
after they have been ten years equal. The last Verse is Mistical, for
there is four numbers, three, two, one, which make six; and eight, which
he calleth _Seraphin_, whether by allusion to that Quire of Angels,
which some call the eight, or whether to the Order of St. _Francis_, who
calleth it self _Seraphical_, is not easie to determine.


LXX.

    French.

    Il entrera vilain, meschant, infame,
    Tyrannisant la _Mesopotamie_,
    Tous amis fait d’Adulterine Dame,
    Tetre horrible noir de _Physiognomie_.

    English.

    He shall come in villaen, wicked, infamous,
    To tyranise _Mesopotamia_,
    He maketh all friends by an adulteress Lady,
    Foul, horrid, black in his _Physiognomie_.

ANNOT.

_Mesopotamia_ is a Greek word, signifying a Countrey between two Rivers;
and though there be many Countreys so seated, yet to this day, it
properly belongeth to that Countrey, that lyeth between the two famous
Rivers _Tigris_ and _Euphrates_ near _Babylon_; the rest is easie.


LXXI.

    French.

    Croistra le nombre si grand des Astronomes,
    Chassez bannis & livres censureq,
    L’An mil six cens & sept par sacrez glomes,
    Que nul au sacres ne seront asseurez.

    English.

    The number of Astronomers shall grow so great,
    Driven away, bannished, Books censured,
    The year one thousand six hundred and seven by sacred glomes,
    That none shall be secure in the sacred places.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is clear, _viz._ that about the year 1607. the number
of Astronomers shall grow very great, of which some shall be expelled
and banished, and their Books censured and suppressed: the rest is
insignificant to me.


LXXII.

    French.

    Champ _Perusin_ O l’Enorme deffaite,
    Et le conflict tout aupres de _Ravenne_,
    Passage sacra lors qu’on fera la feste,
    Vaincueur vaincu, Cheval mange L’avenne.

    English.

    _Perugian_ Field, O the excessive rout,
    And the fight about _Ravenna_,
    Sacred passage when the Feast shall be celebrated,
    The victorious vanquished, the Horse to eat up his Oats.

ANNOT.

_Perugia_ is a City in _Italy_, and so is _Ravenna_, by which it
seemeth there shall be a notable Battle fought, as was once before in
the time at _Lewis_ the XII. King of _France_ between _Gaston de Foix_
his Nephew, and _Don Raimond de Cardonne_ Vice-roy of _Naples_, for
there the _French_ got the Battle; in conclusion of which, the said
_Gaston de Foix_ pursuing a Troop of _Spaniards_ that were retiring, was
unfortunately kill’d, and so the victorious were vanquished.


LXXIII.

    French.

    Soldat Barbare le grand Roy frapera,
    Injustement non esloigné de mort,
    L’Avare Mere du fait cause sera,
    Conjurateur & Regne en grand remort.

    English.

    A Barbarous Souldier shall strike the King,
    Unjustly, not far from death,
    The covetous Mother shall be the cause of it,
    The Conspirator and Kingdom in great remorse.

ANNOT.

These words are so plain that they need no interpretation.


LXXIV.

    French.

    En Terre neuve bien avant Roy entré,
    Pendant subjects luy viendront faire accueil,
    Sa parfidie aura tel rencontré,
    Qu’aux Citadins lieu de feste & recueil.

    English.

    A King being entered far into a new Countrey,
    Whilst his Subjects shall come to welcom him,
    His perfidiousness shall find such an encounter,
    That to the Citizens it shall be instead of feast and welcom.

ANNOT.

The sense of this seemeth to be, that a certain King being far got
into a new conquered Countrey, where he shall deal perfidiously with
his Subjects, that then he shall meet with such an accident, as to his
Citizens shall be instead of feast & welcom.


LXXV.

    French.

    Le Pere & fils seront meurtris ensemble,
    Le Prefecteur dedans son Pavillon,
    La Mere a _Tours_ du fils ventre aura enfle,
    Cache verdure de fueilles papillon.

    English.

    The Father and Son shall be murdered together,
    The Governour shall be so in his Tent,
    At _Tours_ the Mother shall be got with child by her son,
    Hide the greenness with leaves Butter-flye.

ANNOT.

There is nothing hard here but the last Verse, whereby it is signified,
that after such an incest of the Mother with the Son in the City of
_Tours_ (which is a Town in _France_) the fruit of it shall be secretly
buryed, and green Turfs laid upon the place, and Leaves upon them, to
take away the knowledge of it.


LXXVI.

    French.

    Plus _Macelin_ que Roy en _Angleterre_,
    Lieu obscur ne par force aura l’Empire,
    Lasche, sans foy, sans loy, seignera Terre,
    Son temps s’aproche si presque je souspire.

    English.

    More _Macelin_ then King in _England_,
    Born in obscure place, by force shall reign,
    Of loose disposition, without faith, without Law, the ground shall
      bleed,
    His time is drawing so near that I sigh for it.

ANNOT.

_Macelin_, is a Butcher or cruel man, from the Latine word _Macellum_,
which signifieth the Shambles, it is without contradiction that by this
Prophecy is plain concerning the late tyrant _Cromwel_, and his unlawful
Government.


LXXVII.

    French.

    L’Antechrist bien tost trois annichilez,
    Vingt & sept ans durera sa guerre,
    Les Heretiques morts; captifs exilez,
    Sang corps humain eau rougie, gresler Terre.

    English.

    By Antichrist three shall shortly be brought to nothing,
    His War shall last seven and twenty years,
    The Hereticks dead, Prisoners banished,
    Blood, humane body, water made red, Earth hailed.

ANNOT.

What he meaneth here by Antichrist is not easie to determine, for he
cannot mean the Pope, himself being a Papist, nor the great Antichrist,
whose Reign, according to the Scripture, shall last but three years and
a half, it is more likely then that this Stanza hath coherence with the
precedent, and that by it he meaneth _Henry_ the VIII. who for the space
of about 27 years before he dyed, did handle something roughly the Clergy
and Clergy-men.


LXXVIII.

    French.

    Un _Bragamas_ avec la langue torte,
    Viendra des dieux rompre le Sanctuaire,
    Aux Heretiques il ouvrira la porte,
    En suscitant l’Eglise Militaire.

    English.

    A _Bragamas_ with his crooked Tongue,
    Shall come and break the Gods Sanctuary,
    He shall open the Gates unto Hereticks,
    By raising the Militant Church.

ANNOT.

_Bragamas_ is the same thing that we call now _Bragadocio_. By the Gods
Sanctuary, he meaneth the Temples of the _Romish_ Religion, who are
reputed Sanctuaries, and are full of Images, which they worship as Gods,
praying and offering Incense to them.


LXXIX.

    French.

    Qui par fer pere perdra, nay de _Nonnaire_,
    De _Gorgon_ sur la fin sera sang perferant,
    En Terre estrange fera si tout de taire,
    Qu’il bruslera luy mesme & son entant.

    English.

    He that by Iron shall destroy his Father, born in _Nonnaire_,
    Shall in the end carry the blood of _Gorgon_,
    Shall in a strange Countrey make all so silent,
    That he shall burn himself and his intent.

ANNOT.

_Nonnaire_ and _Gorgon_ are two barbarous words, as for the sense of that
and the rest, he that shall be able to read the words, shall be as wise
as my self.


LXXX.

    French.

    Des innocens le sang de Vefue & Vierge,
    Tant de maux faits par moiens ce grand Roge,
    Saints simulachres trempez en ardant cierge,
    De frayeur crainte ne verra nul que boge.

    English.

    The blood of the innocent Widow and Virgin,
    So many evils committed by the means of that great Rogue,
    Holy Images, dipt in burning wax Candles,
    For fear no body shall be seen to stir.

ANNOT.

What he meaneth by the great Rogue is not obvious, but the main drift of
this Stanza seemeth to be, to foretel the abuses that should be offered
to the Popish Images by the Protestant party, as it was done in the time
of the Civil Wars of _France_, and a little while after our Author had
written his Prophecies.

By the great Rogue, he meaneth some chief Commander of the Protestant
party, that were in those days, as the Prince of _Condé_, the Admiral of
_Castilon_, or his Brother _Dandelot_.


LXXXI.

    French.

    Le neuf Empire en desolation,
    Sera changé du Pole Aquilonaire,
    De la _Sicile_ viendra l’emotion,
    Troubler l’Emprise a _Philip_ tributaire.

    English.

    The new Empire in desolation,
    Shall be changed from the Northern Pole,
    The commotion shall come from _Sicily_,
    To trouble the undertaking, tributary to _Philip_.

ANNOT.

This threatneth the Empire that now is in _Germany_, of a great
desolation, and to be removed from its place, and threatneth also the
Island of _Sicily_ of a fearful commotion, which shall trouble the
undertakings of _Philip_, that is, King of _Spain_, because they usually
are called by that name.


LXXXII.

    French.

    Ronge long, sec, faisant du bon valet,
    A la par fin n’aura que son congie,
    Poignant poison & Lettres au colet,
    Sera saisy, eschapé, en dangié.

    English.

    Long gnawer, dry, cringing and fawning,
    In conclusion shall have nothing but leave to be gone,
    Piercing poison and Letters in his Collar,
    Shall be seised, escape, and in danger.

ANNOT.

The words of this are easie to be understood, but not who should be that
man to whom he giveth these four famous Epithetes of _Long-gnawer_,
_dry_, _cringing_ and _fawning_.


LXXXIII.

    French.

    Le plus grand voile hors du port de _Zara_,
    Pres de _Bizance_ fera son entreprise,
    D’Ennemy perte & l’amy ne séra,
    Le tiers a deux fera grand pille & prise.

    English.

    The greatest Sail out of the Port of _Zara_,
    Near _Bizance_ shall make his undertaking,
    There shall be no loss of foes or friends,
    The third shall make a great pillage upon the two.

ANNOT.

By _Zara_ I suppose that the _Venetians_ are meant, who have a very
strong Town of that name, situated in _Dalmatia_. _Bizance_ is
_Constantinople_, as we have said before; now whether this Prophecy was
fulfilled when the _Venetians_ took the Island of _Tenedos_, some 20
years ago, which is not far from _Constantinople_, or whether it is to
come, I dare not assert.


LXXXIV.

    French.

    _Paterne_ aura de la _Sicile_ crie,
    Tous les aprests du Gouphre de _Trieste_,
    Qui s’entendra jusques a la _Trinacrie_,
    De tant de voiles, fuy, fuy, l’horrible peste.

    English.

    _Paterne_ shall have out of _Sicily_ a cry,
    All the preparations of the Gulph of _Trieste_,
    That shall be heard as far as _Trinacry_,
    Of so many Sails, fly, fly, the horrid plague.

ANNOT.

It hath been impossible for me to make any sense of this, and therefore
I believe that it is falsely printed, and that instead of _Paterne_, it
should be _Palerme_, which is the chief Town in _Sicily_. _Trinacry_ is
_Sicily_ it self, so called, _quod tria habeat, άκρα seu promontoria_.


LXXXV.

    French.

    Entre _Bayonne_ & a Sainct _Jean de Lux_,
    Sera posé de _Mars_ la promottoire,
    Aux _Hanix_ d’Aquilon, _Nanar_ hostera _Lux_,
    Puis suffoque au lit sans adjoutoire.

    English.

    Between _Bayonne_ and Saint _John de Lux_,
    Shall be put down the promoting of _Mars_,
    From the _Hunix_ of the North, _Nanar_ shall take away _Lux_,
    Then shall be suffocated in his bed without help.

ANNOT.

_Bayonne_ is a Town in _France_, upon the frontiers of _Spain_, and Saint
_John de Lux_ is the utmost frontiere of _France_, that way, (that being
supposed) he saith, that about Saint _John de Lux_, the promoting of the
war shall be set down; that is, that peace shall be made, as it was about
seven or eight years ago between _France_ and _Spain_, and the Marriage
concluded between the King and the _Infanta_. The two last Verses are
nonsensical, and only set down to make up the rhime.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    Par _Arnani_, _Tholose_, & _Villefranque_,
    Bande infinie par le Mont _Adrian_,
    Passe Riviere, hutin par pont la planque,
    _Bayonne_ entrer tous _Bichoro_ criant.

    English.

    By _Arnani_, _Tholose_, and _Villefranche_,
    An infinite deal of people by the _Aprian_,
    Cross Rivers, noise upon the Bridge and plank,
    Come all into _Bayonne_ crying _Bichoro_.

ANNOT.

_Arnani_, _Tholose_, and _Villefranche_ are Towns of a Province in
_France_ called _Languedoc_. Mont _Adrian_ is a Mountain thereabout, and
_Hutin_ is an old _French_ word, signifying noise and strife, the sense
then of this Prophecy is, that by those Towns and Mountains, shall pass
an infinite multitude of people, with a great noise and strife, and shall
come and enter into _Bayonne_, every one crying in that Countrey Language
_Bichoro_, which is as much as to say, _Victory_.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    Mort conspirée viendra en plein effet,
    Charge donnée & voyage de mort,
    Esleu, crée, receus, par siens desfait,
    Sang d’innocence devant soy par remort.

    English.

    A conspired death shall come to an effect,
    Charge given, and a journey of death,
    Elected, created, received, by his own defeated,
    Blood of Innocency before him by remorse.

ANNOT.

There is no mistical sense in this, and the words are plain, although of
a crabbid construction.


LXXXVIII.

    French.

    Dans la _Sardaigne_ un noble Roy viendra,
    Qui ne tiendra que trois ans le Royaume,
    Plusieurs couleurs avec soy conjoindra,
    Luy mesme apres soin sommeil Matrirscome.

    English.

    A noble King shall come into _Sardinia_,
    Who shall hold the Kingdom only three years,
    He shall joyn many Colours to his own,
    Himself afterwards, care, sleep matrirscome.

ANNOT.

_Sardinia_ is an Island in the _Mediterranean_ Sea, now in the possession
of the _Spaniard_, since he took the Kingdom of _Naples_, the three first
Verses are something intelligible, the last is altogether impossible and
barbarous.


LXXXIX.

    French.

    Pour ne tomber entre mains de son oncle,
    Qui ses enfans par regner trucidez,
    Orant au peuple mettant pied sur _Peloncle_,
    Mort & traisné entre Chevaux bardez.

    English.

    That he might not fall into the hands of his Uncle,
    That had murdered his Children for to rule,
    Taking away from the people, and putting his foot upon _Peloncle_,
    Dead and drawn among armed Horses.

ANNOT.

This signifieth that an Uncle shall murder his Nephews Children, that he
may Reign, and that the said Nephew shall withdraw, and save himself from
the said Uncle. The rest is altogether obscure, if not absurd.


XC.

    French.

    Quand des croisez un trouvé de sens trouble,
    En lieu du sacre verra un Bœuf cornu,
    Par vierge porc son lieu lors sera double,
    Par Roy plus ordre ne sera soustenu.

    English.

    When of the crossed, one of a troubled mind,
    In a sacred place shall see a horny Oxe,
    By Virgin Pork then shall his place be double,
    By King no henceforth, order shall be maintained.

ANNOT.

By the crossed is understood some order of Knight-hood, who for the most
part wear that Badge, one of which being mad, and seeing in a Church a
Horny Oxe come, by a Virgin Hog shall be kept from harm, or rescued by a
Hog or Sow that was a Virgin, and it seems crossed the said Oxe, that he
should not gore the Knight, that then such order of Knighthood shall be
no more maintained nor upheld by the King of that Countrey, wherein such
thing shall happen.


XCI.

    French.

    Parmy les Champs des _Rhodanes_ entrées,
    Ou les croisez seront presques unis,
    Les deux _Brassiers_ en _Pisces_ rencontrées,
    Et un grand nombre par Deluge punis.

    English.

    Through the Fields of the _Rhodanes_ comings in,
    Where the crossed shall be almost united,
    The two _Brassiers_ met in _Pisces_,
    And a great number punished by a Flood.

ANNOT.

_Rhodanus_ in Latine is the River of _Rhosne_, which cometh from
_Switzerland_, and passing through the Lake of _Geneva_, runneth to
_Lyon_, it seemeth then that in those Fields that are about that River
there, will be a fearful inundation, when the _Brassiers_ (or rather
_Croziers_, which is a constellation so called) shall meet in _Pisces_,
which is one of the twelve Signs of the _Zodiack_.


XCII.

    French.

    Loin hors du Regne mis en hazard voiage,
    Grand Ost duyra, pour soy l’occupera,
    Le Roy tiendra les siens captif, ostage,
    A son retour tout Pais pillera.

    English.

    Far from the Kingdom a hazardous journey undertaken,
    He shall lead a great Army, which he shall make his own,
    The King shall keep his prisoners, and pledges,
    At his return he shall plunder all the Countrey.

ANNOT.

These obscure words signifie no more but that a King shall send a great
Army far from his Kingdom, the Commander of which Army shall make the
Army his own, which the King hearing, shall seize upon the Commanders
Relations, and keep them Prisoners and Hostages, for which the said
General being angry, shall at his return spoil the Countrey.


XCIII.

    French.

    Sept mois sans plus obtiendra prelature,
    Par son decez grand schisme fera naistre,
    Sept mois tiendra un autre la Preture,
    Pres de _Venise_ paix union renaistre.

    English.

    Seven months and no more, he shall obtain the Prelacy,
    By his decease he shall cause a great Schisme,
    Another shall be seven months chief Justice,
    Near _Venice_ peace and union shall grow again.

ANNOT.

By this Prophecy three things are foretold, the first is of a Pope that
shall sit but seven months, at whose death there will be a great Schisme;
the second is of a great Governour or Chief Justice, such as were called
by the ancient _Romans Prætores_, shall be in authority also but seven
months; and the third, that hard by _Venice_ all these differences shall
be composed, and peace made again.


XCIV.

    French.

    Devant la Lac ou plus cher fut getté,
    De sept mois & son Ost desconfit,
    Seront _Hispans_ par _Albanois_ gastez,
    Par delay perte en donnant le conflict.

    English.

    Before the Lake wherein most dear was thrown,
    Of seven months, and his Army overthrown,
    _Spaniards_ shall be spoiled by _Albaneses_,
    By delaying; loss in giving the Battle.

ANNOT.

It is very difficult, if not impossible to tell what our Author meaneth
by the Lake, wherein the most dear was thrown, and lost his Army. The
_Albaneses_ are a Nation between the _Venetians_ and _Greece_, now for
the most part subject to the said _Venetians_.


XCV.

    French.

    Le Seducteur sera mis dans la Fosse,
    Et estaché jusques a quelque temps,
    Le Clerc uny, le Chef avec sa Crosse,
    Pycante droite attraira les contems.

    English.

    The Deceiver shall be put into the Dungeon,
    And bound fast for a while,
    The Clerk united, the head with his Crosierstaf,
    Pricking upright, shall draw in the contented.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are plain, the two last Verses not so, which seemeth
to foretell of a great union among the Clergy, which shall draw to them
those that were peaceably affected.


XCVI.

    French.

    La Synagogue sterile sans nul fruit,
    Sera receue entre les Infideles,
    De _Babylon_ la fille du poursuit,
    Misere & triste luy trenchera les Aisles.

    English.

    The Synagogue barren, without fruit,
    Shall be received among the Infidels,
    In _Babylon_, the daughter of the persecuted,
    Miserable and sad shall cut her wings.

ANNOT.

A Synagogue is a place where the Jews assemble for Divine Worship, as
the Christians do in Churches or Temples, the said Jews Synagogue is
threatned here to be unfruitful and barren, and chiefly in _Babylon_, by
the means of a woman, daughter of one persecuted; belike of some of their
own tribe, whom the rest did persecute.


XCVII.

    French.

    Au fins du _Var_ changer le _Pompotans_,
    Pres du Rivage, les trois beaux enfans naistre,
    Ruine au peuple par Aage competans,
    Regne au Pais changer plus voir croistre.

    English.

    At the ends of the _Var_ to change the _Pompotans_,
    Near the Shore shall three fair Children be born,
    Ruine to the people by competent Age,
    To change that Countreys Kingdom, and see it grow no more.

ANNOT.

The first Verse being made of insignificant words, as _Var_ and
_Pompotans_ cannot be understood; the other three doth foretel of three
handsom Children, that shall be born near the Shore, which when they have
attained a competent Age, shall change the Kingdom of that Countrey, and
suppress it.


XCVIII.

    French.

    Des gens d’Eglise sang sera espanché,
    Comme de l’eau en si grande abundance,
    Et de long temps ne sera retranché,
    Veüe au Clerc ruine & doleance.

    English.

    The blood of Churchmen shall be spilt,
    As water in such abundance,
    And for a good while shall not be stayed,
    Ruine and grievance shall be seen to the Clerk.

ANNOT.

This is easie to be understood, which foretelleth a very great
persecution to the Clergy-men, _viz._ Papists, of which Religion our
Author was, if this be not already past in the Civil Wars of _France_,
that were made for Religion, in the beginning of Reformation, where
abundance of Clergy-men did perish on both sides.


XCIX.

    French.

    Par la puissance des trois Rois temporels,
    En autre lieu sera mis la Saint Siege,
    Ou la substance de l’Esprit corporel,
    Sera remis & receu pour vray Siege.

    English.

    By the power of three Temporal Kings,
    The Holy See shall be put in another place,
    Where the substance of the Corporeal Spirit,
    Shall be restored and admitted for a true seat.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is very remarkable, for the thing it foretelleth, _viz._ a
translation of the See of _Rome_, that is, the Popedom into another place
by three Temporal Kings, and not onely that, but it seemeth by the sense
of the last two Verses, that these will keep the Ecclesiastical authority
to themselves.


C.

    French.

    Pour l’abundance de l’Armée respandue,
    Du haut en bas, par le bas au plus haut,
    Trop grande foy par jeu vie perdue,
    De soif mourir par abondant defaut.

    English.

    Through the abundance of the Army scattered,
    High and low, low and high,
    Too great a belief a life lost in jesting,
    To die by thirst, through abundance of want.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is, that by reason of a great Army that shall be much
scattered, and occupy a great deal of room, water will be so scarce, that
some shall die for thirst, it is that he calleth here, _To die by thirst,
through abundance of want_.


Other Stanza’s heretofore Printed, under the VIII. CENTURY.


I.

    French.

    Seront confus plusieurs de leur attente,
    Aux habitans ne sera pardonné,
    Qui bien pensoint perseverer l’attente,
    Mais grand loisir ne leur sera donné.

    English.

    Many shall be confounded in their expectation,
    The Citizens shall not be forgiven,
    Who thought to persevere in their resolution,
    But there shall not be given them a great leisure for it.

ANNOT.

This is plain, and needeth no interpretation.


II.

    French.

    Plusieurs viendront & parleront de Paix,
    Entre Monarques & Seigneurs bien puissans,
    Mais ne sera accordé de si pres,
    Que ne se rendent plus qu’autres obeissans.

    English.

    Many shall come and shall talk of Peace,
    Between Monarchs and Lords very powerful,
    But it shall not be agreed to it so soon,
    If they do not shew themselves more obedient then others.

ANNOT.

We are just now at the Eve of this Prophecy, when so many Princes and
Potentates do busie themselves about a Mediation between the two Crowns
of _France_ and _Spain_, &c.


III.

    French.

    Las quelle fureur, helas quelle pitie,
    Il y aura entre beaucoup de gens,
    On ne vit onc une tell amitié,
    Qu’auront les Loups a courir diligens.

    English.

    Ha! what fury, alas what pitty,
    There shall be betwixt many people,
    There was never seen such a friendship,
    As the Wolfs shall have in being diligent to run.

ANNOT.

It is indeed a great fury and pity to see how wicked people, and chiefly
Usurers and false dealers, (understood here by the name of Wolfs) are
diligent in doing mischief, and to make good the old Proverb, _Homo
homini Lupus_, there being no other Creature but the Wolf that devours
those of his own kind.


IV.

    French.

    Beaucoup de gens viendront parlementer,
    Aux grand Seigneurs qui leur feront la guerre,
    On ne voudra en rien les escouter,
    Helas! si Dieu n’envoie Paix en Terre.

    English.

    Many folks shall come to speak,
    To great Lords that shall make War against them,
    They shall not be admitted to a hearing,
    Alas! if God doth not send Peace upon Earth.

ANNOT.

This carrieth its sense with it, and is plain.


V.

    French.

    Plusieurs secours viendront de tous costez,
    De gens lointains qui voudront resister,
    Ils seront tout a coup bien hastez,
    Mais ne pourront pour cette heure assister.

    English.

    Many helps shall come on all sides,
    Of people far off, that would fain to resist,
    They shall be upon a sudden all very hasty,
    But for the present they shall not be able to assist.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to point at this present conjuncture of affairs, where there
is so many buisying themselves about the relief of _Flanders_, of which I
see no great likelihood.


VI.

    French.

    Las quel plaisir ont Princes estrangers,
    Garde toy bien qu’en ton Pais ne _Vienne_,
    Il y auroit de terribles dangers,
    Et en maintes Contrées, mesme en la _Vienne_.

    English.

    Ha! what pleasure take Forrain Princes?
    Take heed least any should come into thy Countrey,
    There should be terrible dangers,
    In several Countreys, and chiefly in _Vienna_.

ANNOT.

There is two Towns called _Vienna_’s, one is in _Germany_, in the
Province of _Austria_, and is the Emperours Seat, the other in _France_,
a metter of twenty miles beyond _Lion_, the rest is easie.




THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ IX.


I.

    French.

    Dans la maison du Traducteur de _Boure_,
    Seront les lettres trouvées sur la Table,
    Borgne, roux blanc, chenu, tiendra de cours,
    Qui changera au nouveau Connestable.

    English.

    In the house of the Translator of _Boure_,
    The Letters shall be found upon the Table,
    Blind of one eye, red, white, hoary, shall keep its course,
    Which shall change at the coming of the new Constable.

ANNOT.

It is not easie to understand what he meaneth by the Translator of
_Boure_, unless it be some mean and pittiful fellow, that lived by
Translating things from one language into another, because the _French_
use to call a man that is inconsiderable, _un homme du boure_, that is a
man of Flocks; and so much the more I am of this opinion, because of the
scurvy Epithetes, he attributeth to the same person, by which he might
easily be known as _blind of one eye, red, white, hoary_, &c.


II.

    French.

    Du haut du Mont _Aventin_ voix ouye,
    Vuidez, vuidez de tous les deux costez,
    Du sang des rouges sera l’Ire assouvie,
    D’_Arimin_, _Prato_, Columna debotez.

    English.

    From the top of Mount _Aventin_, a voice was heard,
    Get you gone, get you gone on all sides,
    The Choler shall be fed with the blood of the red ones,
    From _Arimini_ and _Prato_, the Colonnas shall be driven away.

ANNOT.

Mount _Aventine_ is one of the seven Mountains of _Rome_, from the top of
which our Author saith that a voice was heard crying and repeating, _get
you gone_, and the reason is, because choler and anger shall feed upon
the blood of the Cardinals, understood here by the name of _red ones_.

_Arimini_ and _Prato_ are two cities in _Italy_.

The _Colonna_ is the chiefest and ancientest family of _Rome_.


III.

    French.

    Le _magna vaqua_ a _Ravenne_ grand trouble,
    Conduits par quinze enserrez a _Fornase_,
    A _Rome_ naistra deux Monstres a teste double,
    Sang, feu, deluge, les plus grands a l’espase.

    English.

    The _Magna vaqua_ great trouble at _Ravenna_,
    Conducted by fifteen, shut up at _Fornase_,
    At _Rome_ shall be born two Monsters with a double head,
    Blood, fire, Flood, the greater ones astonished.

ANNOT.

This word of _Magna vaqua_ is either falsly printed, or altogether
barbarous and insignificant, and so is that of _Fornase_, which maketh
the two first Verses incapable of translation; the other are easie.


IV.

    French.

    L’An ensuivant descouverts par Deluge,
    Deux chefs esleus, le premier ne tiendra,
    De fuyr ombre a l’un deux le refuge,
    Saccagée case qui premier maintiendra.

    English.

    The year following being discovered by a Flood,
    Two Chiefs elected, the first shall not hold,
    To fly from shade, to one shall be a refuge,
    That house shall be plundered which shall maintain the first.

ANNOT.

Our Author meaneth, that the year after the former Prophecy is come to
pass, this shall also be fulfilled, whereby two Chief Commanders shall be
chosen, the first of which shall not stand, but shall be compelled to run
away, and to seek his security in the open Fields, and that house that
did uphold the first shall be plundered.


V.

    French.

    Tiers doigt du pied au premier semblera,
    A un nouveau Monarque de bas haut,
    Qui _Pise_ & _Luiques_ tyran occupera,
    Du precedent corriger le defaut.

    English.

    The third toe of the foot shall be like the first,
    To a new high Monarch come from low estate,
    Who being a Tyrant shall cease upon _Pise_ and _Luica_,
    To correct the faults of him that preceded him.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that some body pretending to mend the Government
of those two places that are in Italy, shall tyrannically make himself
Master of them.


VI.

    French.

    Par la _Guyenne_ infinité d’_Anglois_,
    Occuperont par nom d’_Angle Aquitaine_,
    Du _Languedoc_. _I._ palme _Bourdelois_,
    Quils nommeront apres _Barboxitaine_.

    English.

    There shall be in _Guyenna_ an infinite number of _English_,
    Who shall occupy it by the name of _Angle Aquitaine_,
    Of _Languedoc_, _I_ by the Land of _Bourdeaux_,
    Which afterwards they shall call _Barboxitaine_.

ANNOT.

Here is foretold a famous invasion, that shall be made by the _English_
upon that part of _France_ called _Guyenne_, and in Latine _Aquitania_,
of which _Bourdeaux_ is the chief City, insomuch, that the _English_
afterwards shall call that Countrey _Angl’ Aquitaine_.


VII.

    French.

    Qui ouvrira le Monument trouvé,
    Et ne viendra le serrer promptement,
    Mal luy viendra & ne poura prouvé,
    Si mieux doibt estre Roy _Breton_ ou _Normand_.

    English.

    He that shall open the Sepulchre found,
    And shall not close it up again presently,
    Evil will befall him, and he shall not be able to prove
    Whether is best a _Britain_ or _Norman_ King.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is perspicuous.


VIII.

    French.

    Puisnay Roy fait son pere mettre a mort,
    Apres conflict de mort tres in honeste,
    Escrit trouvé soupcon, donra, remort,
    Quand loup chassé pose sur la couchete.

    English.

    A younger King causeth his father to be put
    To a dishonest death, after a Battle,
    Writing shall be found, that shall give suspicion and remorse,
    When a hunted Wolf shall rest upon a truckle bed.

ANNOT.

The words and sense are plain.


IX.

    French.

    Quand Lampe ardente de feu inextinguible,
    Sera trouvée au Temple des Vestales,
    Enfant trouvée, feu, eau passant par crible,
    _Nismes_ eau perir, _Tholouse_ cheoir les Halles.

    English.

    When a Lamp burning with unquenchable fire,
    Shall be found in the Temple of the Vestals,
    A Child shall be found, Water running through a Sieve,
    _Nismes_ to perish by Water, the Market-hall shall fall at _Tholouse_.

ANNOT.

The ancient _Vestals_, were a Kind of Religious Virgins in the ancient
_Romans_ time, who if they did forfeit their honour, were buried alive
in a Cave, with a little Bread and Water, and a Lamp burning, our
Author would have, that when a Lamp shall be found lighted with an
unquenchable fire, in that place where then their Temple was, that then
_Nismes_ (which is a City of _Languedoc_), shall perish by Water, and
the Market-hall of _Tholouse_ shall fall, whether such a Lamp may be
contrived as to burn with an unquenchable fire, is too long and tedious a
discourse to be disputed here.


X.

    French.

    Moine, Moinesse d’Enfant mort exposé,
    Mourir par Ourse & ravy par verrier,
    Par _Foix_ & _Panniers_ le Camp sera posé,
    Contre _Tholose_, _Carcas_, dresser forrier.

    English.

    Monk and Nun having exposed a dead Child,
    To be killed by a she Bear, and snatcht away by a Glazier,
    The Camp shall be set by _Foix_ and _Panniers_,
    And against _Tholouse_, _Carcas_ shall raise a Harbinger.

ANNOT.

_Foix_ and _Panniers_ are two Towns in _Languedoc_, and so are _Tholouse_
and _Carcassonne_, called here _Carcas_, for the abbreviation of the
Verse, the sense then of this prophecy is, that when the two first Verses
shall come to pass, that then an Army shall lie about those Towns, and
_Carcassonne_ shall be against _Thoulouse_.


XI.

    French.

    Le juste a tort a mort l’on viendra mettre,
    Publiquement, & du milieu estaint,
    Si grande Peste en ce lieu viendra naistre,
    Que les Jugeans fouyr seront contraints.

    English.

    The just shall be put to death wrongfully,
    Publickly, and being taken out of the midst,
    So great a Plague shall break into that place,
    That the Judges shall be compelled to run away.

ANNOT.

Many understand this of the late King, and last Plague.


XII.

    French.

    Le tant d’argent de _Diane_ & _Mercure_,
    Les simulachres au Lac seront trouvez,
    Le Figulier cherchant argille neuve,
    Luy & les siens, d’or seront abreuvez.

    English.

    The so much Silver of _Diana_ and _Mercury_,
    The Statues shall be found in the Lake,
    The Potter seeking for new clay,
    He and his shall be filled with Gold.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning a _Potter_, who seeking and digging for
new Clay, shall find in a drained Lake the Statues of _Diana_ and
_Mercury_ all of silver, besides other great riches; seeing this Prophecy
is not come to pass yet (that I know) it will not be amiss, for the
divertisement of the Reader, to relate here a notable and authentical
History of a Potter that hath much ressemblance with this, and will be
a convincing Argument, that Mines grow in the Earth as Turfs do, and as
_Virgil_ sayeth of the golden branch:

    _Uno avulso non deficit alter._

It is written by Doctor _de Rochas_, Physitian to the present Chancellor
or _France_, who was upon the place, and an eye witness of the
circumstances of it, having also an interest in it, in the behalf of his
Father, who was overseer of the Mines in that Province, therefore I shall
relate it in his own words, as they are in his Book of _Mineral Waters_.

[Sidenote: _A notable History._]

In _Provence_ near _Thoulon_, is a Mountain called _Carquairené_, at the
foot of which and near the brim of the Sea, there dwelled a Potter with
all his tools about him; It chanced that on a day as he went to fetch
Wood in that Mountain, to bake his wares, he heard a voice of a little
Kid, which some Shepherd had left behind them unawares, and was fallen
in a little hole that answered to natural, great and deep Caves; this
man seeing no Shepherds about him, thought presently it was a strayed
Kid, therefore he followed the cry with his ear so directly, that he came
by the orifice of that hole, where he heard and saw the Kid, which he
resolved to carry away with his Wood, therefore he took the Cords that
were at his Mules Saddle, and that he used to bind his Load with, and
with the help of them, and of some big pieces of Wood he got down, where,
he did observe round about him many other Caves, contiguous and separated
from this, which his curiosity caused him to view, and found in the chief
of these Caves a great quantity of stones heaped upon one another, & of a
substance and colour of Brass, and among the rest there was one that came
forth out of the Rock, about the bigness, shape, and length of a mans
arm, when it is stretched out; he did apparently judge that the weight
and brittleness of that matter had caused those stones to fall down,
and that the same that he saw come out of the Rock in this manner, was
already loose and like to fall; this man finding himself among such an
abundance of rich Lingots, which fortune did offer him, did not know the
value of them, but did like the Cock of _Æsop_ which left the precious
Pearl to take the Corn of Wheat; thus this _Jason_ took very little of
this Golden Fleece, and only a small piece, which he broke from a bigger
with one of his Tools, and imployed all his industry to carry away his
Kid, which at last with much ado he got out, and carried upon his Mule,
believing certainly that this provision would be more profitable to
him and his Family, then the yellow stone which he had in his pocket,
weighing about five pounds, and which he intended to give to a Tinker
of _Thoulon_, his Gossip and good friend, in hope that for the same he
might be presented with a bottle of Wine, to keep company to his Kid; and
accordingly the next morning by break of day he went to _Thoulon_ and
stayed in the Shop of his friend, who did look with admiration upon so
resplendent Brass; a Gold-smith who lodged over the way, and observed
the splendor of that Divine mettal, drew near, and presently would have
bargained for it, with a great deal of transportation and alteration.
The Potter asked him only twenty pence, which the Gold-Smith would have
given him presently, but the Tinker making sign to him to retract his
words, he put his lingot in his pocket again, with protestation that he
would not part with it, unless he had something that were worth the pains
of going where he had it; in conclusion, after many contestations and
disputes, the Potter who did suspect that it might be gold, would not
sell nor deliver it under the sum of thirty Crowns, which the Gold-Smith
paid him presently, and which he carried away with more joy, then if he
had been possessor of greater riches; the Gold-smith on the other side,
who thought that his profit would be above a hundred pounds sterlings,
did refine this stone, that was about five pound weight, out of which he
drew four pound weight, of very good and pure gold, the rest was a kind
of dross, that made it thus brittle; one ought not to think that the Mine
is all of the same perfection, but it purifieth it self, according as
nature thrusteth it out of the Rock, as we see that Rubies and Emeralds
are purer, then the Rock from whence they come. This Gold-Smith having
found such fortune, and being resolved to make the best use of it, went
to the Lord _Scaravaque_, then Governour of the Town, and imparted unto
him this new discovery, that he might have his assistance and favour in
it, and that under his power and authority he might follow and wait upon
this precious business without being disturbed by any body, to which the
Governour did so much the easier consent, that this Tradesman did oblidge
himself to give him the best part of the profit that should arise from
thence, and that should exceed any Travels into the _Indies_ or _Peru_.

In the mean time the Potter was not asleep, the Gold-smiths money had
stirred his appetite, and the charm of this witchcraft that worketh
generally upon all spirits, did put him upon new hopes. He went into
the Mountain with his wife, and with the help of a rope Ladder, which
he had provided, and some Iron tools, wherewith he had loaded his Mule,
he went down into the Caves, and with much endeavour did at last break
that piece, that came out of the Rock like a mans arm, because all the
other that were tumbled upon the ground, were so big and heavy that he
could not remove them, when he had broken it down, though it were about
fourscore and two pounds weight, nevertheless with the help of his wife
and of his Ropes and Ladder he got out again, and stopt the hole with a
large stone, and some Earth, upon which he planted some small Bushes so
ingeniously, that this hole could never be found out again.

The Lord _Scaravaque_ who was most impatient, to conquer like another
_Jason_ this Golden Fleece, and who was set on by the persuasions of the
Gold-smith, sent for the Potter, under pretence to employ him in the
making and furnishing of some Tiles and other small commodities that
depended on his art. The Potter obeyed presently, drawn by the hopes to
sell his wares well, and mistrusting nothing at all what they would ask
him. As soon as he came, the Governour asked him and perswaded him with
the best and most flattering words he could, to tell where he had the
yellow stone that he sold to the Gold-smith. The Potter who more and more
began to know the value of this rare Treasure, invented presently a lie,
to free himself of the importunity of them that would have deceived him;
therefore with an ingenuity, as simple as artificial he answered, he had
found it upon the brim of the Sea, where may be some Ship had been cast
away, or the Waves had cast it upon the shore.

The Governour answered that this could not be, and therefore threatned
him of violence, and to send for all that he had in his House, which
put the fellow into a great perplexity, because of the other stone that
should be found there, therefore he chose rather to give it them out
of his good will, then to put himself in danger of loosing all, and
perchance of being abused to boot, without any more ado, he ingenuously
confessed he had another piece of the same stuff as the former in his
House, which he had likewise found in the same place, which he was
ready to put into their hands, provided he might have his share of it,
and be suffered to get his livelihood peaceably. The Lord _Scaravaque_
did promise him all what he desired, and gave him some men to keep him
company, with command to bring him back again, and to take special care
he should not make an escape. At last this poor man came back again
with that piece, which did more inflame the passion that the Governour
had to know the place whence came that rich treasure; but neither for
prayers, promises, or threats he would never reveal it, which did oblige
the Governour to shut him up close in a Chamber, where nevertheless they
gave him Victuals and made ready a Bed, but he refused both, and by
an extraordinary sadness, gave shew that some notorious mischance was
waiting on him, which proved true, for he was found dead in the Morning;
which did put the Lord _Scaravaque_ in a grief unexpressible, to see
himself deprived by this accident, of the fruit that his hopes had made
him conceive. He had recourse to the Potters wife for this discovery, but
she could never attain to it, whatsoever exact searches she could make:
yea, and after she was married again with a young man, who had spent in
that search most of his time. The Lord _Scaravaque_ and other persons
of quality have employed all their skills and endeavours, but all their
industry and charges have been without effect, as well as of many others,
who attempted the same; about that time my Father who was overseer of
the Mines in _Provence_, having received the news of a business of
such consequence, that did concern his place, went presently unto that
Mountain, to see if he could discover those wonders, I was then in his
company, as also that woman, _viz._ the Potters wife, who carried us in
several places for many days, without any success at all, although she
gave notice that she could here the Waves of the Sea, when she was in the
Cave with her first Husband, so that all our endeavours proved fruitless
and unprofitable, because my Father fell sick, which made us forsake our
quest, which is of such a consequence as not to be neglected.

During the time of our painful visiting that Mountain, I did consider the
particularities of that rich Mountain, and observed that the top of it
was almost all Azur, which tokens are the beams of that golden Sun and
are the hairs of that fair goodness, under whose feet all things submit;
in a word, are the true and infallible signs that underneath are Mines
of Gold and Silver. And as I have directed all my thoughts many times to
find out the means to compass so excellent a work, whose profit would
surpass all what the _Indies_ furnish unto strangers, and that with so
much less charges and danger, that there is no heed of Ships or Fleet to
cross over the Sea, from one Pole to the other, nor fight against any
enemies: at last I have attained to a certain knowledge, which putteth me
in hope, and makes me promise and engage my word, that at least I shall
find a thred of that golden Mine, which may chance to lead us to the
Centre of all these Treasures, but the Royal Authority being necessary
to prop up this design, it belongeth to his Majesty to take what course
he thinketh best for this, and to me to obey, execute his will. This
digression which is an assured experiment, (that is a certain truth),
is not come into this discourse, but only to prove that Mines grow by
augmentation, in converting into their own nature the more subtle parts
of the Neighbouring Earth. Thus far Doctor _de Rochas_.

    French.

    Les Exilez autour de la _Sologne_,
    Conduits de nuict pour marcher en l’_Auxois_,
    Deux de _Modene_ truculent de _Bologne_,
    Mis discouverts par feu de _Burancois_.

    English.

    The banished about _Sologne_,
    Being conducted by night to go into _Auxois_,
    Two of _Modena_, the cruel of _Bolonia_,
    Shall be discovered by the fire of _Burancois_.

ANNOT.

_Sologne_ is a Province in _France_, between the _Perche_ and the _Main_.
_Auxois_ is a Countrey in the South of _France_, so called of its chief
Town called _Auch_, the seat of an Archbishop. _Modena_ is a Town in
_Italy_, and _Bolonia_ another not far from it. _Burancois_ is a part of
the Province of _Dauphiné_. The meaning then of this Prophecy is, this
being known, the Reader may easily find out the rest of the sense.


XIV.

    French.

    Mis en planure chauderon d’Infecteurs,
    Vin miel en huile & bastis sur Fourneaux,
    Seront plongez sans mal dit malfacteurs,
    Sept. fum. extaint au Canon des _Borneaux_.

    English.

    A Dyers Kettle being put an a Plein,
    With Wine, Honey and Oil, and built upon Furnace,
    Shall be dipt, without evil, called Malefactors,
    Seven. fum. put out at the Canon of _Borneaux_.

ANNOT.

This hath a relation to the punishment, which in some parts of _France_
and _Flanders_ is inflicted upon false Coiners, which are commonly boiled
in Oil, in a great Kettle, such as our Author here saith belong to Dyers.
The Author then will have that the time shall come, when seven of that
gang shall be so punished together in a Plain, where a great Kettle shall
be set for that purpose upon a Furnace.


XV.

    French.

    Pres de _Parpan_ les rouges detenus,
    Ceux du milieu parfondrez menez loing,
    Trois mis en pieces, & cinq mal soustenus,
    Pour le Seigneur & Prelat de _Bourgoing_.

    English.

    Near unto _Parpan_ the red ones detained,
    Those of the middle sunk and carried far off,
    Three cut in pieces, and five ill backed,
    For the Lord and Prelate of _Burgoing_.

ANNOT.

_Parpan_ is either a barbarous or fained name, by the _red ones_, he
hath hitherto understood some Cardinals, the Reader may expound the rest
according to his fancy.


XVI.

    French.

    De _Castel Franco_ sortira l’assemblée,
    L’Ambassadeur non plaisant fera Schisme,
    Ceux de _Riviere_ seront en la meslée,
    Et au grand Goulphre desnieront l’entrée.

    English.

    Out of _Castel Franco_ shall come the Assembly,
    The Embassador not pleased, shall make a Schisme,
    Those of _Riviere_ shall be in the medley,
    And shall deny the entry of the great Gulf.

ANNOT.

_Castel Franco_ is a Town in _Piemont_; _Riviere_ is a strong Castle in
_Burgundy_, but what he meaneth by the great Gulfe, is more then I can
tell.


XVII.

    French.

    Le tiers premier, pis que ne fit _Neron_,
    Vuidez vaillant que sang humain respandre,
    Redifier fera le Forneron,
    Siecle d’or mort, nouveau Roy grand esclandre.

    English.

    The third first, worse than ever did _Nero_,
    Go out valliant, he shall spill much humane blood,
    He shall cause the Forneron to be builded again,
    Golden Age dead, new King great troubles.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy pointeth directly at our Authors Master _Charles_ the IX.
King of _France_, whom he calleth he _the third first_, because he was
the third son to _Henry_ II. and came to be King, using more cruelties
then ever _Nero_ did, for he was the cause of the Massacre of the
Protestants in _France_ in the year 1572. where above a hundred thousand
people were murdered. _Forneron_ is a barbarous word, put here to make a
Verse, and to rhime with _Neron_. At that time he saith the _Golden Age
was dead_, and upon the coming of a new King, who was _Henry_ III. great
tumults did happen, and great Wars, as is to be seen in the _French_
History.


XVIII.

    French.

    Le Lys _Dauffois_ portera dans _Nancy_,
    Jusques en _Flanders_ Electeur de l’Empire,
    Neusve obturée au grand _Montmorency_,
    Hors lieux pronez delivre a clere peyne.

    English.

    _Dauffois_ shall carry the Lillie into _Nancy_,
    As far as _Flanders_ the Elector of the Empire,
    New hinderance to great _Montmorency_,
    Out of proved places, delivered to a clear pain.

ANNOT.

Although the words and sense of this Prophecy be most obscure,
nevertheless we shall endeavour as much as we can to render them
something intelligible to the Reader.

By the first Verse is to be understood that _Dauffois_, or rather
_Dauphinois_, which is the Title of the Kings of _France_ eldest Son
shall carry the Lillie, which is the Arms of _France_ into _Nancy_, the
chief Town in _Lorrain_, which came to pass in the time of the last King
_Lewis_ the XIII.

By the second Verse is understood the Elector of _Triers_, who was taken
by the _Spaniards_ in his own Town, and carried prisoner to _Bruxelles_.

By the third and fourth is expressed the ill luck of the Duke of
_Montmorency_, who having taken part with the Duke of _Lorrain_, and
the Duke of _Orleans_ the Kings Brother, was routed in a Battle, taken
prisoner, and afterwards beheaded at _Thoulouse_.


XIX.

    French.

    Dans le milieu de la Forest _Mayenne_,
    _Sol_ au _Lion_ la Foudre tombera,
    Le grand Bastard issu du grand _du Maine_,
    Ce jour _Fougeres_ pointe en sang entrera.

    English.

    In the middle of the Forrest of _Mayenne_,
    _Sol_ being in _Leo_ the Lightning shall fall,
    The great Bastard begot by the great _du Main_,
    That day _Fougeres_ shall enter its point into blood.

ANNOT.

_Fougeres_ is either the name of a Town in little _Britanny_, or that of
a Noble House, the words are very plain, therefore I leave the sense to
every ones capacity.


XX.

    French.

    De nuit viendra par la Forest de _Rennes_,
    Deux parts _Voltorte Herne_, la pierre blanche,
    Le Moine noir en gris dedans _Varennes_,
    Esleu Cap. cause tempeste, feu, sang tranche.

    English.

    By night shall come through the Forrest of _Rennis_,
    Two parts _Voltorte Herne_, the white stone,
    The black Monk in gray within _Varennes_,
    Elected Cap. causeth tempest, fire, blood cutteth.

ANNOT.

_Rennes_ is the chief Town of little _Britanny_; the second Verse being
made of barbarous words, is impossible to be understood. The third
and fourth Verse signifieth, that when a black Monk in that Town of
_Varennes_ shall put on a gray sute, he shall be elected Captain, and
cause a great tempest or broils by fire and blood.


XXI.

    French.

    Au Temple hault de _Blois_ sacre _Salonne_,
    Nuict Pont de _Loire_, Prelat, Roy pernicant,
    Cuiseur victoire aux marests de la _Lone_,
    D’ou Prelature de blancs abormeant?

    English.

    At the high Temple of _Blois_ sacred _Salonne_,
    In the night the Bridge of _Loire_, Prelat, King mischievous,
    A smarting Victory in the Marsh of _Lone_,
    Whence Prelature of white ones shall be abortive.

ANNOT.

There is a mistake in the first Verse, for instead of _Salonne_, it must
be written _Soulaire_, which is a _Priory_ and Church at the top of
_Blois_, all the rest signifieth that in one night these shall happen,
_viz._ that the Bridge, the Prelat, and a pernicious King with a smart
victory shall perish, whence the Prelature, that is the place of Command
upon the white ones, _viz._ Canons and Prebends in their Surplices, shall
be void and empty.


XXII.

    French.

    Roy & sa Cour au lieu de la _langue halbe_,
    Dedans le Temple vis a vis du Palais,
    Dans le Jardin Duc de _Montor_ & d’_Albe_,
    _Albe_ & _Mantor_, poignard, langue, en Palais.

    English.

    King and his Court in the place of _langue halbe_,
    Within the Church over against the _Pallace_,
    In the Garden Duke of _Montor_ and _Albe_,
    _Albe_ and _Mantor_, dagger, tongue and Pallate.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is very obscure, for, first no body can tell what he meaneth
by _langue halbe_, which is the foundation of all the rest of the sense;
Secondly, what this Duke of _Montor_ and _Mantor_ should be, which has
been unknown in the Histories hitherto; and thirdly, what construction
and sense can be made of these disjunctives: _Albe_, _Mantor_, _Dagger_,
_Tongue_, _Palate_. Therefore i’le leave it free to every bodies opinion
to make his construction.


XXIII.

    French.

    Puisnay jouant au fresch dessous la tonne,
    Le haut du toit du milieu sur la teste,
    Le Pere Roy au Temple Saint _Solonne_,
    Sacrifiant sacrera sum de feste.

    English.

    The youngest Son playing under the tun,
    The top of the House shall fall upon his head,
    The King his Father in the Temple of Saint _Soulaine_,
    Sacrificing shall make festival smoak.

ANNOT.

By this is meant, that the youngest Son of a King, shall be knocked in
the head, while he is a playing under a tun; his Father being at the same
time in the Temple of Saint _Soulaine_ at Mass.


XXIV.

    French.

    Sur le Palais au Rocher des Fenestres,
    Seront ravis les deux petits Roiaux,
    Passer _Aurelle_, _Lutece_, _Denis_ cloistres,
    _Nonnain_, _Mollods_ avaler verts noiaux.

    English.

    Upon the Pallace at the Rock of the Windows;
    Shall be carried the two little Royal ones,
    To pass _Aurele_, _Lutece_, _Denis_ Cloisters,
    _Nonnain_, _Mollods_ to swallow green stones of fruit.

ANNOT.

These two or three last Stanzas have been concerning the City of _Blois_,
to which it seemeth that this hath also relation, for he saith that
two little Royal Children shall be carried at the top of the Castle,
and shall be conveyed beyond _Aurelle_ (which is _Orleans_ in Latine
_Aurelianum_) _Lutece_, which is _Paris_; S. _Denis_ Cloisters, which is
beyond _Paris_, and a Nunnery besides, where it is like they shall be
left to eat green stones of fruit, which is not easie to be understood,
no more then the word _Mollods_.


XXV.

    French.

    Passant les Ponts, venir prez de Roziers,
    Tard arrivé plustost quil cuidera,
    Viendront les noves _Espagnols_ a _Beziers_,
    Qui icelle chasse emprinse cassera.

    English.

    Going over the Bridge to come near the Rose-trees,
    Come late, and sooner then he thought,
    The new _Spaniards_ shall come to _Beziers_,
    Who shall cashiere this new undertaken hunting.

ANNOT.

_Beziers_ is a City in _Languedoc_; the rest may be construed by the
meanest capacity.


XXVI.

    French.

    Nise sortie sur nom des Lettres aspres,
    La grande Cappe fera present non sien,
    Proche de _Vultry_ aux murs des vertes capres,
    Apres _Plombin_ le vent a bon escient.

    English.

    A silly going out, caused by sharp Letters
    The great Cap shall give what is not his,
    Near _Vultry_ by the Walls of green Capers,
    About _Piombino_ the wind shall be in good earnest.

ANNOT.

This signifieth that there shall be a silly surrendring of a Town, caused
by sharp and threatning Letters that shall be sent into it. By the great
_Cap_ he useth to understand the _Pope_, who he saith shall give what
is not it, as he hath done many times; _Vultry_, in Latine _Velitrum_,
and _Piombino_ are two Cities in _Italy_, which are threatned here with
mighty winds.


XXVII.

    French.

    De bois la garde vent clos ront Pont sera,
    Haut le receu frappera le _Dauphin_,
    Le vieux _Teccon_ bois unis passera,
    Passant plus outre du Duc le droit confin.

    English.

    The Fence being of Wood, close Wind, Bridge shall be broken,
    He that’s received high, shall strike at the _Dolphin_,
    The old _Teccon_ shall pass over smooth Wood,
    Going over the right confines of the Duke.

ANNOT.

The first Verse signifieth that a woodden Bridge shall be broken by a
close wind, as did happen to the Millers Bridge, and the Birds Bridge in
_Paris_.

The second Verse seemeth to foretel the conspiracy of the Mareshal of
_Biron_, against _Henry_ IV. his Dolphin and Estate.

The third and fourth, the Wars and Conquest which the said King (whom he
called old _Teccon_), made upon the Duke of _Savoy_, who had corrupted
the said Marshal of _Biron_.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Voile _Symacle_, Port _Massiliolique_,
    Dans _Venise_ Port marcher aux _Pannons_,
    Partir du Goulfre & sinus _Illirique_,
    Vast a _Sicile_, _Ligurs_ coups de Canon.

    English.

    _Symaclian_ Sail, _Massilian_ Port,
    In _Venice_ to march towards the _Hungarians_,
    To go away from the Gulf and _Illirick_ Sea,
    Toward _Sicily_, the _Genoeses_ with Cannon shots.

ANNOT.

What he meaneth by _Symaclian Sail_, is not easie to determine;
_Massilian Port_ is that of _Marseilles_ in _France_, called in Latine
_Massilia_, the sense of this Prophecy then if any be, is, that a
great Fleet shall go from thence to _Venice_, to carry succours to the
_Hungarians_, who it seemeth shall be much distressed at that time by
the _Turks_, and that _Sicily_ and _Genoa_ shall add to this Fleet a
considerable succour of Men, and Warlike Munition.


XXIX.

    French.

    Lors que celuy qu’a nul ne donne lieu,
    Abandonner voudra lieu prins non pris,
    Feu, Nef, par faignes, bitument a _Charlieu_,
    Seront _Quintin_, _Bales_ repris.

    English.

    When he that giveth place to no body,
    Shall forsake the place taken, and not taken,
    Fire, Ship, by bleeding bituminous at _Charlieu_,
    Then _Quintin_ and _Bales_ shall be taken again.

ANNOT.

_He that giveth place to no body_ is the Pope; as for the last Verse, I
had rather read St. _Quintin_ and _Gales_, which are two considerable
Towns in _France_, then otherwise.

That place taken, not taken was the City of _Noyon_ in _Picardy_, which
was taken by the _Spanish_ Cavalry, cloathed after the _French_ Mode,
which stratagem deceived the Citizens and Soldiers that defended it: so
he saith taken, because it fell into the hands of the _Spaniards_, and
_not taken_, because it was by a stratagem or deceit.


XXX.

    French.

    Au Port de _Puola_ & de St. _Nicolas_,
    Perir _Normande_ au Gouffre _Phanatique_,
    Cap de _Bizance_ rues crier Helas!
    Secours de _Gaddes_ & du grand _Philippique_.

    English.

    At the Harbour of _Puola_ and of St. _Nicolas_,
    A _Norman_ Ship shall perish in the Phanatick Gulf,
    At the Cape of _Byzantium_ the streets shall cry Alas!
    Succours from _Cadis_ and from the great _Philippe_.

ANNOT.

_Puola_ is for _Paulo_ here, and by it is understood the port of _Malta_,
which being Besieged by the _Turks_, _Philip_ the II. King of _Spain_,
sent an Army to relieve it, which made those of _Byzantium_ (which is
_Constantinople_) cry alas, _&c._


XXXI.

    French.

    Le tremblement de Terre a _Mortara_,
    _Cassich_, St. _George_ a demy perfondrez,
    Paix assoupie la guerre esuaillera,
    Dans Temple a Pasques abysmes enfondrez.

    English.

    There shall be an Earthquake at _Mortara_,
    _Cassich_, St. _George_ shall be half swallowed up,
    The War shall awake the sleeping pace,
    Upon Easterday shall be a great hole sunk in the Church.

ANNOT.

_Mortara_ is a Town in _Italy_, by _Cassich_ and St. _George_ he meaneth
two other places.


XXXII.

    French.

    De fin _Porphire_ profond Collon trouvée
    Dessoubs la laze escrits Capitolin,
    Os, poil retors, _Romain_ force prouvée,
    Classe agiter au Port de _Methelin_.

    English.

    A deep Column of fine _Porphyry_ shall be found,
    Under whose Basis shall be _Roman_ writings,
    Bones, haires twisted, _Roman_ force tried,
    A Fleet a gathering about the Port of _Methelin_.

ANNOT.

_Porphiry_ is a kind of hard red Marble speckled with white spots, which
is very scarce, and chiefly in great pieces; our Author then saieth that
a great Colomn of that stuff shall be found, and about the Basis of it
some words in Roman Characters, and that about that time a great Fleet
shall be a gathering at the Port of _Methelin_, which is an Island in the
_Archipelago_, belonging now to the _Turks_, as for the third Verse, I
cannot tell what to make of it.


XXXIII.

    French.

    _Hercules_ Roy de _Rome_ & _Dannemark_,
    De _Gaule_ trois _Gayon_ surnommé,
    Trembler l’_Itale_ & l’un de Saint _Marc_,
    Premier sur tous Monarque renommée.

    English.

    _Hercules_ King of _Rome_, and _Denmark_,
    Of _France_ three _Guyon_ surnamed,
    Shall cause _Italy_ to quake and one of St. _Marck_,
    He shall be above all a famous Monarch.

ANNOT.

All these intricated words and sense foretell that, when a King of
_Danmarck_ named _Hercules_ shall be made King of the _Romans_, that
then _Italy_ and _Venice_ it self shall stand in great fear of him; and
that he shall be as great a Prince or Monarch as ever was in _Europe_;
and that very likely, for by his dignity of King of the _Romans_ he
consequently shall attain to the Empire.


XXXIV.

    French.

    Le part solus Mary sera Mitré;
    Retour conflict passera sur la tuille,
    Par cinq cens un trahir sera tultré,
    _Narbon_ & _Saulce_ par coutaux avons d’huile.

    English.

    The separated Husband shall wear a Miter,
    Returning, Battle he shall go over the Tyle,
    By five hundred one dignified shall be betrayed,
    _Narbon_ and _Salces_ shall have Oil by the Quintal.

ANNOT.

The first Verse signifieth, that some certain man who was married, shall
be parted from his wife, and shall attain to some great Ecclesiastical
Dignity.

The second Verse is, that in coming back from some place or entreprise,
he shall be met and fought with, and compelled to escape over the Tyles
of a House.

The third Verse is, that a man of great account shall be betrayed by five
hundred of his men.

And the last, that when these things shall come te pass, _Narbon_ and
_Salces_, which are two Cities of _Languedoc_, shall reap and make a
great deal of Oil.

    And _Ferdinand_, having a Troop of faire men,
    Shall leave the flower to follow the _Macedonian_,
    At his great need his way shall fail him,
    And he shall go against the _Myrmidon_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy ought to be understood of an Emperour of _Germany_, whose
name shall be _Ferdinand_, who being accompanied with many _Germans_,
that for the most part are faire haired people shall come and War
against _Græcia_, which is expressed here by the names of _Macedon_ and
_Myrmidon_, the first of which is a Countrey, and the last a Nation, both
in _Græcia_.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Un grand Roy prins entre les mains d’un jeune,
    Non loin de Palques confusion, coup cultre:
    Perpet. cattif temps que foudre en la Hune,
    Trois Freres lors se blesseront & meurtre.

    English.

    A great King taken in the hands of a young one,
    Not far from Easter, confusion, stroke of a knife,
    Shall commit, pittiful time, the fire at the top of the Mast,
    Three Brothers then shall wound one another, and murder done.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was fulfilled in the year 1560. when _Antony_ of _Bourbon_
King of _Navarre_, and his Brother _Lewis_ of _Bourbon_ Prince of
_Condé_, coming to King _Francis_ II. at _Orleans_, upon the 29. of
_October_, the Prince of _Condé_ was put in prison, and the King of
_Navarre_ arrested. The Lord _Andrew Fauyn_ in his History of _Navarre_,
saith, that the opinion of the Councel was, that the Prince of _Condé_
should be beheaded, for having been the chief of the conspiracy at
_Amboise_, and the King of _Navarre_ should be stabbed in the Kings
Chamber by the King himself, assisted by others for that purpose. The
Lady of _Montpensier_ gave notice of it to the King of _Navarre_, who
being sent for by the King, charged expresly _Cattin_ his waiting man
and an old servant of his Father take a care and preserve his bloody
shirt after his death till his son came to Age, to revenge it upon the
murderers. God be thanked this came not to pass, for the King having
called him, and going about to provoke him with foul words, he answered
so meekly and humbly, that the Kings anger was appeased, where upon the
Duke of _Guise_ going out of the room said, _O what a cowardly Prince
is this_. These things are expressed in the first and second Verse,
when he saith that a great King should be put in Prison by a young one,
because _Antony_ of _Bourbon_, though he was not a great King in Lands,
yet he was a great one in courage and prudence. And it was _not far from
Easter_, sith it was but five months before, _viz._ from the beginning of
_November_, to the sixth of _April_ 1591 which was Easterday; the Author
putteth in this circumstance, because the next Easter after, the King of
_Navarre_ was made General of _France_ under the Queen Regent.

He addeth _the blow of a Knife_, as we have shewed; he also saith _a
lasting bad time_, which proved very true; moreover, he saith, _what
lightning in the Hunt_ or Topmast, because King _Francis_ died presently
after. In the fourth Verse he saith, _that three Brothers shall be hurt
and killed_, those three Brothers were _Antony_ of _Bourbon_ King of
_Navarre_, killed at the Siege at _Rouen_, the Cardinal of _Bourbon_, and
_Lewis_ of _Bourbon_ Prince of _Condé_, killed at the Battle of _Jarnac_.

    English.

    Bridges and Mills in _December_ overturned,
    In so high a place the _Garonne_ shall come,
    Walls, Building, _Thoulose_ overturned,
    So that none shall know its place, so much Matrone.

ANNOT.

Here is foretold a prodigious inundation of the River _Garonne_, in
the month of _December_, by which the Walls, Building, and the City
of _Thoulouse_ is threatned to be overturned. The last word of all is
barbarous, and added to make up the rhime.

    L’Entrée de _Blaye_ par _Rochelle_ & l’_Anglios_,
    Passera outre le grand _Æmathien_:
    Non loing d’_Agen_ attendra le _Gaulois_,

    English.

    The coming in at _Blaye_ by _Rochel_ and the _English_,
    Shall go beyond the great _Æmathien_,
    Not far from _Agen_ shall expect the _French_,
    Help from _Narbonne_ deceived by entertainment.

ANNOT.

For the better understanding of this, the hard words must first be made
plain; _Blaye_ is a City upon the River _Garonne_, and the Port-Town
to _Bourdeaux_; _Rochel_ is a City upon the same Coast; _Agen_ is a
City in _Gascony_ not far from _Bourdeaux_, and _Narbonne_ is a City
in _Languedoc_, by the Mediterranean Sea; _Æmathian_ was formerly the
Countrey of _Macedonia_, wherein _Julius Cæsar_ and _C. Pompeius_ fought
their last Battle in the _Pharsalian_ Fields, and therefore saith the
Latine Poet _Lucanus_:

    _Bella per Æmathios plusquam civilia campos._

These things being considered the sense is, that there shall be an
Invasion made by the _English_, to whom those of _Rochel_ shall joyn,
upon the Town of _Blaye_, which shall proceed as far as _Agen_, and
that thereabout will be a bloody Encounter between the _English_ and
_French_, beyond that which was fought in the _Æmathian_ Fields, and that
the succours that should come from _Narbonne_ to the _French_, shall be
deluded and hindered by the speech and discourse of some.

    French.

    En _Arbissella_, _Vezema_ & _Crevari_,
    De nuit conduits pour _Savonne_ atraper,
    Le vif _Gascon_, _Giury_, & la _Charry_,

    English.

    In _Arbissella_, _Vezema_ and _Crevari_,
    Being conducted by night to take _Savona_,
    The quick _Gascon_, _Giury_ and the _Charry_,
    Behind old Walls and new Pallace to graple.

ANNOT.

_Arbissella_ is a Town situated by the Sea-side above _Savona_, going
towards _Genoa_. _Vezema_ and _Crevari_ are in the Inland Countrey, and a
little further remoted from the Sea then _Arbissella_. _The quick Gascon_
was _Blasius_ of _Monluc_, one of the Valliantest men of his time, who
came from a single Souldier to be Marshal of _France_. _Guiry_ and _la
Charry_ were two of his Companions. This Stanza doth Prophetically
foretell two things, one is, the design that the Marshal of _Brissac_,
then Governour of _Piemont_ had upon _Savona_: the other, the taking of
_Pianca_ by _Blasius_ of _Monluc_, as to the first, the Lord of _Villars_
writeth in his Memorials, that the Lord _Damzay_ sent advice to the King,
that the taking of _Savona_ was more probable then any other design,
which signifieth that the Marshal of _Brissac_ had of a long time eyed
that Town, and therefore he sent by night some Troops into those three
little Towns, to see if they could surprise _Savona_, but the design did
not succeed. The Histories only mention that the Marshal of _Brissac_ went
from Court in the year 1557. with a design to take _Savona_; but this
stanza speaketh of the same design 1556.

At the same time in the year 1556. the 29. of _June Blasius_ of _Monluc_,
as he relateth in his Commentaries, did surprise the Town and Fort of
_Piance_, called in Latine _Corsinianum_, he had with him the Captain _la
Charry_, the Captain _Bartholomew_ of _Pezero_, and the son of Captain
_Luzzan_. At first the _French_ were beaten back, but the valliant
_Monluc_ did encourage them again by his example, going the first in, and
saying only, _follow your Captain_.

Which having said, he thrust himself under the Gate, where three or four
men might stand sheltered by the planks of the Fort, and having his Sword
in the left hand, and his dagger in the right, he began to break and cut
the Brick and made a hole, which opening by degrees, he thrust his arm
through, and pulled the gap so strongly, that he caused all the Wall to
fall down upon himself, without being hurt by it. This is the meaning
of the Author in the fourth Verse; when he saith, _the quick Gascon was
behind the Wall_; In prosecution of this, the Switzers did beat down the
rest of the Wall, and all came into the Town crying, _France, France_.
_Monluc_ ran presently to the Fort, and with the help of his men took it,
that is the meaning of the Author, when he saith, _old and new Pallace
to graple_. The old Pallace was adjoining to the Market-place of the
Town, in which the _French_ were prisoners with the Captain _Gourgues_,
to the number of fifty or sixty tied two and two, and so kept by twenty
Souldiers, whom they did kill as we have said. The new Pallace was
the Fort. The Author used that ancient word _grapper_, which in the
_Provencal_ languague signifieth, to pull down with ones hands, and in
the contrary sense, to shut and plaister so well some thing, that there
will be a necessity of the help of the hands to open what was shut up.

    English.

    Near _Quentin_ in the Forrest _Bourlis_,
    In the Abby the _Flemmings_ shall be slashed,
    The two younger sons half a stonished with blows,
    The followers oppressed, and the Guards all cut in pieces.

ANNOT.

This is a peculiar accident that happened before the taking of the
Town of Saint _Quentin_ by the _Spaniard_ in the year 1557. and fell
out thus. News being come to the King of _France_, that the powerful
Army of the _Spaniard_ was gone to Besiege St. _Quentin_, he made all
imaginable diligence to succour it; the _Spaniards_ to hinder the relief
had seized upon an ancient Abby of the _Vermandois_, which is in the
next Forrest, that was anciently called the Forrest _Bourlis_, and is at
present called the Forrest of the _Abbay Vermandois_, called in Latine
_Augusta Veromanduorum_, builded by an ancient _Hungarian_ Captain called
_Vermandig_. In process of time it was all ruinated, and only one Abby
left, wherein was the Episcopal See, which afterwards was transferred
into the City of _Noyon_. After the ruine of this Town, that of St.
_Quentin_ next to it became the chief City of _Vermandois_; It was named
St. _Quentin_, because the Emperor _Dioclesian_ having sent St. _Quentin_
a _Roman_ Senator to be Governour of it, he did convert the Inhabitants
to the Christian Faith, and after he himself did suffer there Martyrdom.

In that Abby a great many _Flemmings_ had intranched themselves, but
the _French_ going to relieve the Town, did force their Trenches and
Fortifications, and in the heat of the fight the two younger Sons of the
Captain being armed _Cap a pée_, though they were not killed, yet were
astonished with blows they did receive upon their heads, their followers
and Guards being all cut in pieces.

    The great _Cheyren_ shall seize upon _Avignon_,
    Letters from _Rome_ shall come full of bitterness,
    Letters and Embassies shall go from _Chanignon_,
    _Carpentras_ taken by a black Duke with a red Feather.

ANNOT.

This did happen lately, _viz._ some five or six years ago, when the Duke
of _Crequy_ Embassadour at _Rome_ was affronted by the _Corses_, which
are the Popes Guard: for which the King of _France_ demanded reparation,
and seized upon _Avignon_, till the Pope granted him that all the said
_Corses_ should be banished, and a Pyramis erected in _Rome_ to the
perpetual infamy of that Nation.

    Against the Barbarian the fleet shall take her aim,
    The Barbarian shall be driven back as far as _Thunis_.

ANNOT.

The sense of these words is very plain and signifieth onely, that there
will be an union and League between these Towns, _viz._ _Barcelona_,
_Genoa_, _Vinice_, and the Kingdom of _Sicily_ against the Turks, whom
they shall encounter near _Monaco_, and put them to flight, and follow
them as far as _Tunis_.

    English.

    The _Crucigere_ Army being about to Land,
    Shall be watched by the _Ismaelites_,
    Being beaten on all sides by the Ship _Raviere_,
    Presently assaulted by ten chosen Galleys.

ANNOT.

By the _Crucigere_ Army is understood the Christian Army, because the
word _Crucigere_ signifieth one that beareth a Cross, from the two
Latine words _Crux_ and _gero_; the _Ismaelites_ are the _Turks_, who
boast themselves to be descended from _Ismael_, the son of _Abraham_
and _Agar_, the meaning of this is, that the Christians going about to
attempt some landing place, the Turks shall watch them, and set upon
them by Land and Sea, in which Sea fight he mentioneth only ten choice
Galleys, and a notable Ship called _Raviere_, (if it be not false
printed) I am much of an opinion that this came to pass when _Philip_
the II. King of _Spain_ made an attempt upon _Algiers_, by his Admiral
_André d’Oria_, who had to do with the _Moores_ upon the Land, ready to
receive him, and some part of their fleet that watched him, but cross and
contrary winds caused him to return _re infecta_.

    Go forth, go forth out of _Geneva_ all,
    _Saturn_ of gold, shall be changed into Iron,
    They against _Raypos_ shall extermine them all,
    Before it happeneth, the Heavens will shew signs.

ANNOT.

[Sidenote: _Called here against Raypos._]

This is a Prophecy concerning _Geneva_, out of which he warneth every
one to come; his reason is, that the golden Age of that Town shall be
changed into an Iron one; and that there shall be one against _Raypos_,
that shall extermine them all, before which there shall appear some signs
in Heaven. Now the Author being a rank Papist, it is to be supposed that
he warneth out of _Geneva_ all those of his Faith, because of the coming
of _Calvin_, whom he foresaw was to come into that Town, and to change
the Government thereof, and to _extermine them all_, which is to be
understood, in point of Religion, as for what prodigies did precede that
change; I had no time to consult Authors upon it, the judicious Reader
may chance to find them in those that have written of this matter.

    Great _Mendosus_ shall obtain his dominion,
    Far from the Court he shall cause him to be countermanded,
    _Piemont_, _Picardy_, _Paris_, _Tyrhen_ the worse.

ANNOT.

By _Mendosus_, is Anagrammatically to be understood _Vendosme_; but who
is that shall never be weary of asking, or whose Dominion _Vendosme_
shall have, or what is meant by the last two Verses, passeth my
understanding.

    Get you gone, run away from _Thoulouse_ ye red ones,
    There shall expiation be made of the Sacrifice,
    The chief cause of the evil under the shade of gourdes,
    Shall be strangled, a presage of the destruction of much flesh.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy doth onely and properly belong to the City of _Thoulouse_;
and by it are warned all the red ones, that is, all those that usually
wear Red or Scarlet Gowns, as those of the Parliament and the Capitols
to come out of it, because saith he, _There shall an expiation be made
of the Sacrifice_, meaning that there shall be a great slaughter among
the Citizens, as it did happen at several times, the first _Anno_ 1563.
another time when the first President _Durauti_, and several other of the
red Gowns were put to death, _&c._ The two last Verses signifie, that
the chief contriver of this uproar shall be strangled, and many others
besides him.

    The underwritten to an unworthy deliverance,
    Shall have from the multitude a contrary advice,
    They shall change their Monarch and put him in peril,
    They shall see themselves shut up in a Cage over against.

ANNOT.

This is plainly to be understood of those Traytors, the delivered and
signed the death of King _Charles_ the I. of blessed Memory, against the
sense and advise of at least three parts of four of the Nation, and who
afterward saw themselves for the most part shut in Prison for this fact
and brought to a shameful end.

    The great Maritime City of the Ocean,
    Encompassed with Chrystaline Fens,
    In the Winter _Solstice_ and in the spring,
    Shall be tempted with fearful wind.

ANNOT.

By _the great Maritime City of the Ocean, Encompassed with Crystaline
Fens_, is to be understood the City of _London_, for as for that of
_Venice_, it is situated upon the _Mediterranean_ or rather _Adriatick_
Sea: _London_ then is threatned here of a fearful wind, which whether
the Author meaneth for the time that is past now, and that shall come
hereafter I know not, sure I am, that I have within this fifteen years
seen two such winds in _London_, as I never saw the like any where else;
the first was that day that _Olivier_ the Usurpator died, the other
was about six or seven years ago, caused by the lightning that fell in
_Hereford-shire_, and did mix with a Western wind and came as far as
_London_, carrying the tops of houses, and doing then for above 10000.
pounds dammage.

    English.

    _Gand_ and _Bruxelles_ shall go against _Antwerp_,
    The Senat of _London_ shall put their King to death,
    The Salt and Wine shall not be able to do him good,
    That they may have the Kingdom into ruine.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy taken with all its circumstances, and the subject it
treateth of, is the most remarkable of all those that ever _Nostradamus_
was Author of, for here we see a concatenation of circumstances linked
together, to make it true to any bodies eyes, for first the number of
this Stanza being 49, signifieth the year wherein the King died, for
although by the _English_ account, who begin their year at the 25. of
_March_, it may be said it was in 48, because it did happen upon the
30_th._ of _January_, yet according to the general account of the most
part of the World, the year begin upon the first day of _January_, so
that the King dying on the 30_th._ of _January_, it may be said it was in
the year 1649.

The first Verse signifieth, that at that time there was no good
intelligence between the Cities of _Flanders_ and _Brabant_, as I
remember very well that there was not, but upon what score, I have
forgotten.

The second Verse is plain to any body that can either read or hear it.

The third Verse by _the Salt and Wine_, understandeth _France_, who was
then in War with the _Spaniard_, and in some divisions among themselves,
so that they could not take the Kings part as to relieve and free him by
force, but sent Embassadours to mediate a composure of the difference.

The fourth Verse intimateth that by reason of the said Wars that were
in _France_, the said murdering Parliament had liberty to do what they
listed for the bringing the Kingdom into ruine.

    _Mensodus_ shall soon come to his high Government,
    Putting a little aside the _Norlaris_,
    The red, pale, the Male at the interreigne,
    The young fear, and dread barbarisme.

ANNOT.

_Mensodus_ is the Anagramme of _Vendosme_, by which is meant _Antony_ of
_Bourbon_ Duke of _Vendosme_, brother to the then Prince of _Condé_, and
father to _Henry_ IV. _Norlaris_ is the Anagram of _Lorrain_; now any
body that understandeth any thing in History, knoweth what dissention
and feud there was between the House of _Bourbon_, and that of _Lorrain_
in the time of _Francis_ the II. for the House of _Bourbon_, though next
to the Royal blood, was the least in favour, and those of the House of
_Lorrain_ did Govern all, and had so far prevailed as to have got the
Prince of _Condé_ into their hands, and had him condemned to have his
head cut of, which would have been executed, had not the King that very
day fallen sick of the disease he died of. Now this being understood our
Author will have that _Mensodus_, which is _Vendosme_ shall lay aside the
_Norlaris_, that is _Lorrein_. By _the red pale_ is meant the Cardinal of
_Lorrain_, brother to the Duke of _Guise_, who grew pale at this. By _the
male at the interreigne_ is so obscure, that we leave it to the judgement
of the Reader.

    Against the red, Sects shall gather themselves,
    Fire, water, iron, rope, by peace it shall de destroyed,
    Those that shall conspire shall not be put to death,
    Except one, who above all shall undo the World.

ANNOT.

The name of _red Sects_, may very well be applied to the Protestants of
_France_, against whom in those days it seemed that fire, Water, Iron and
Rope had conspired, for they were put to death by each one of those fatal
instruments for their Religion sake. This is a lively expression of the
unhappy Massacre of the Protestants in _France_ upon St. _Bartholomews_
day 1572.

The two last Verses signifie, that all the Contrivers of that Councel,
were of opinion at first to proceed some other way, but only the Duke of
_Guise_, who was the principal actor in it, and whom our Author saith,
did undo the world; for he was the cause of mischief, not only then but
ofterwards.

    Peace is coming on one side and War on the other,
    There was never so great a pursuing,
    Man, Woman shall bemoan, Innocent blood shall be spilt,
    It shall be in _France_ on all sides.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was fulfilled in the Reign of _Charles_ the IX. in the
year 1558. when the peace was treated of, and concluded the year after
1559. the War on the other side begun to appear by the raising of the
Protestants, who begun publickly their opinion in the time of _Francis_
the II. and _Charles_ the IX.

There was never seen such a prosecution of War and of Peace together; for
there was never an estate more embroiled in Wars than that of _Charles_
the IX. was, nor where Peace was more sought after; for there was nothing
but Wars and treaties of Peace, Men and Women did complain on all
sides, for the wrong and dammages they received from both parties, the
Protestants believing to do God a good service in destroying Images, and
killing Priests and Monks. And the Papists on the other side thinking to
make a sweet Sacrifice unto God, in practising the same cruelties upon
the Protestants, and so in all corners of _France_ every one did set
himself to do evil.

    Shall cause Pages to be thrown to be burnt alive,
    Happy shall he be who shall be far from this doing,

ANNOT.

A young Tyrant called here _Nero_, shall cause some Pages to be burnt
alive in three Chimneys, and afterwards himself shall be put to death by
three of his own blood, this fact savoureth so much of bestial cruelty,
that I cannot belive any Christian Prince can ever be guilty of it.

    Near _Ravenna_, those that shall plunder the Lady,
    In the deep Sea shall be the Embassador of _Lisbonne_,
    The hidden under the Rock, shall carry away seventy Souls.

ANNOT.

The Port of _Corsibonne_, must of necessity be that of _Ancona_; first
because there is no Port of the former name near the City of _Ravenna_.
Secondly, because _Ancona_ is near _Ravenna_.

By the Lady is meant the Chappel or Church of our Lady of _Loretto_,
which is threatned here to be plundred by some _Turks_ or Pyrates,
inticed thereunto by the manifold riches that are said to be therein.

The third Verse speaketh of a _Portugues_ Embassador, who it seemeth
shall be drowned or buried in the main Sea.

The fourth Verse giveth warning of some Robbers and Pyrates, very like to
be _Turks_, who being in Ambuscado, and shrouded among the Rocks by the
Sea side, shall carry away seventy Souls.


LV.

    French.

    L’Horrible guerre qu’en Occident s’appreste,
    L’An ensuivant viendra la Pestilence,
    Si fort terrible, que jeune, viel, ne beste,
    Sang, feu, _Mercu._ _Mars_, _Jupiter_ en _France_.

    English.

    An horrid War is a preparing in the West,
    The next year shall come the Plague,
    So strangly terrible, that neither young nor old, nor beast shall
      escape
    Blood, fire, _Mercu._ _Mars_, _Jupiter_ in _France_.

ANNOT.

That word _a preparing_ in the first Verse, signifieth that he speaketh
of a time, wherein War was a making ready, when he was a writing.

The _West_, of which our Author speaketh, is not formerly the West which
is _Spain_, but is the West respectively to his Countrey of _Provence_,
which is _Picardy_, _Lorrain_, and the Countrey of _Mets_, in all these
Places that are Westerly from _Provence_, there was great Wars in the
year 1557 in _Picardy_ in the year 1558. at _Calais_ and _Thionville_,
and at last from the middle of that year to the end of it, were seen two
great Armies of both Kings, which threatned a horrid slaughter, had not
God Almighty provided against it by the treaty of Peace of the _3d._ of
_April_ 1559 the year following, which was 1559. there did happen what he
foretelleth, _viz._, the Plague so strangely terrible to Young, Old, and
Beasts _&c._

And in those quarters there was nothing but Fire and Blood; that is,
Massacres and ruines of all sorts, then did Rule in _France_, the three
Planets of _Jupiter_, _Mars_ and _Mercury_, _Jupiter_ and _Mercury_, for
the peace that was then concluded, and _Mars_ for the War that was then
on foot.

The History of _Provence_ mentioneth, that that Pestilence was called by
the Physitians, _Febris erratica_, by which within the space of five or
six Months, died almost an infinite number of people.


LVI.

    French.

    Camp prés de _Noudam_ pasiera _Goussanville_,
    Et a _Maiotes_ laissera son enseigne,
    Convertira en instant plus de mille,
    Cherchant le deux remettre en chaine & legne.

    English.

    A Camp shall by _Noudam_ go beyond _Goussanville_,
    And shall leave its Ensign at _Maiotes_,
    And shall in an instant convert above a thousand,
    Seeking to put the two parties in good understanding together.

ANNOT.

These three words of _Noudam_, _Goussanville_, and _Maiotes_ are three
little inconsiderable Countrey Towns, situated near one another; the
meaning then of it is, that an Army near _Noudam_, shall go through
_Goussanville_, and shall in an instant convert, that is, draw to his
party above a thousand of the contrary party, the business being about
the procuring of a good understanding and amity between two great ones.


LVII.

    French.

    Au lieu de _Drux_ un Roy reposera,
    Et cherchera Loy changeant d’Anatheme,
    Pendant le Ciel si tresfort Tonnera,
    Portée neufve Roy tuera soy mesme.

    English.

    In the place of _Drux_ a King shall rest himself,
    And shall seek Law changing Anatheme,
    In the mean while the Heaven shall Thunder so strongly,
    That a new gate shall kill the King him self.

ANNOT.

_Drux_ is a City in _Normandy_, near which _Henry_ the IV. got a
memorable victory.

It is said that in that place a King shall rest himself, and shall
endeavour to change Religion, but at that time it shall Thunder and
Lighten so much, that by the fall of a new gate, the King himself shall
be killed.


LVIII.

    French.

    Au costé gauche a lendroit de _Vitry_,
    Seront guettez les trois rouges de _France_,
    Tous assommez rouge, noir non meurdry,
    Par les _Bretons_ remis en asseurance.

    English.

    On the left hand over against _Vitry_,
    The three red ones of _France_ shall be watched for,
    All the red shall be knockt dead, the black not murdered,
    By the _Britains_ set up again in security.

ANNOT.

What is meant here by the three red ones of _France_ is hard to decide,
whether they be Cardinals or Judges; because both wear commonly Scarlet
Gowns, or some Noblemen cloathed in Scarlet, but it seemeth by this
that there shall be a lying in wait for four men, three of which shall
be cloathed in Red, and one in Black, those in Red shall be knockt down
dead, but he in Black shall not, and this is to be done on the left hand,
over against _Vitry_, which is a City in _Champagne_.


LIX.

    French.

    A la _Ferté_ prendra la _Vidame_,
    _Nicol_ tenu rouge quavoit produit la vie,
    La grand _Loyse_ naistra qui fera clame,
    Donnant _Bourgongne_ a _Bretons_ par envie.

    English.

    In the _Ferté_ the _Vidame_ shall take
    _Nicol_, reputed red, whom life hath produced,
    The great _Lewis_ shall be born, who shall lay claim,
    Giving _Burgundy_ to the _Britains_, through envy.

ANNOT.

This Stanza wanting both quantity in the Cadence of the Verse, and
Connexion in the sense, sheweth that it is either falsly printed, or else
the Author had no mind it should be understood; we shall only say, the
_Ferté_ is a Town in _Champagne_. _Vidame_ is a Lords Title in _France_,
of which there are but four of that sort, and are called in Civil Law
_Vicedominus_, who by his first Institution, was temporal Judge of the
Bishop; the first of those _Vidames_ or _Vicedomini_ in _France_, is that
of _Amiens_, the second of _Chartres_, the third of _Rhemes_, and the
fourth of _Gerberon_.


LX.

    French.

    Conflict _Barbare_ en la Cornere noire,
    Sang espandu trembler la _Dalmatie_,
    Grand _Ismael_ mettra son promontoire,
    Ranes trembler, secours _Lusitanie_.

    English.

    A _Barbarian_ fight in the black Corner,
    Blood shall be spilt, _Dalmatia_ shall tremble for fear,
    Great _Ismael_ shall set up his promontory,
    Frogs shall tremble, _Portugal_ shall bring succour.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie foretelleth divers accidents in several places, without
determination of any precise time; as for example, I understand by that
_Barbarian conflict, near the black Corner_, to be some famous Battle
among the Infidels themselves, some where about the Black Sea; then he
saith, _that abundance of Blood shall be spilt, and ~Dalmatia~ shall
tremble_, which is a Province belonging to the _Venetians_, and bordering
upon _Græcia_; by great _Ismael_ he understandeth the great Sophy of
_Persia_, whose name hath been often so. By the Frogs it is not easie to
know whether he meaneth _France_ or _Spain_, for both abound in that kind
of Insects.


LXI.

    French.

    La pille faite a la Coste Marine,
    _Incita nova_ & parens amenez,
    Plusieurs de _Malthe_ par le fait de _Messine_,
    Estroit serrez seront mal guerdonnez.

    English.

    The plunder made upon the Sea Coast,
    _Incita nova_ and friends brought up,
    Many of _Maltha_, for the fact of _Messina_,
    Being close kept, shall be ill rewarded.

ANNOT.

It seemeth that this Plunder made upon the Sea Coast, shall be about
_Messina_, by the _Maltheses_, who afterwards shall rue for it, being
taken Prisoners, and severely punished.

As for the expression _Incita nova_, it is a barbarous derivation of the
Latine, to signifie the stirring of new troubles.


LXII.

    French.

    Au grand de _Cheramonagora_,
    Seront croisez par rangs tous attachez,
    Le _Pertinax Oppi_, & _Mandragora_,
    _Raugon_ d’_Octobre_ le tiers seront laschez.

    English.

    To the great one of _Cheramonagora_,
    Shall be crossed by Ranges, all tyed up,
    the _Pertinax Oppi_, and _Mandragora_,
    _Raugon_ the third of _October_ shall be set loose.

ANNOT.

The word _Cheramonagora_, is either altogether barbarous and
insignificant, or must be derived from these three Greek words, χεὶρ,
_manus_, μόνος, _folus_, and ἄγω, _duco_, and so it may signifie one than
leadeth along by the hand, in which sense may be understood the King of
_France_, who alone leadeth his people by the hand, without any help of
Councel.

The second Verse signifieth the Oppositions he shall meet with among his
Neighbours, combined together to hinder him.

By _Oppi_, he meaneth here _Opium_, the Juice of Poppies, which he
calleth here _Pertinax_; because of its pertinacious quality in procuring
sleep, as also _Mandragora_.

By _Raugon_, he meaneth some other soporiferous Herb; so that it seemeth
that those three things shall be given upon the third of _October_ to
some body, it seemeth to that _Cheramonagora_, by whom some understand
the King of _France_, others _Oliver_ the last usurpator.


LXIII.

    French.

    Plaintes, & pleurs, cris, & grands hurlemens,
    Pres de _Narbonne_, a _Bayonne_ & en _Foix_,
    O quels horribles, calamitez, changemens,
    Avant que _Mars_ revolu quelquefois.

    English.

    Complaints and tears, cries, and great howlings,
    Near _Narbonne_, _Bayonne_ and in _Foix_,
    O what horrid calamities and changes,
    Before _Mars_ hath made sometimes his revolution.

ANNOT.

_Narbonne_, _Bayonne_, and _Foix_ are Towns of _Languedoc_, a Province in
_France_; the rest is easie.


LXIV.

    French.

    L’_Æmathian_ passer Monts _Pyrenées_,
    En _Mars Narbon_ ne fera resistance,
    Par Mer & Terre sera si grand menée,
    Cap. n’ayant Terre seure pour demeurance.

    English.

    The _Æmathian_ shall pass by the _Pyrenean_ Mountains,
    In _March Narbon_ shall make no resistance,
    By Sea and Land he shall make so much ado,
    Cap. shall not have safe ground to live in.

ANNOT.

The _Æmathian_ properly should be the _Macedonian_, but by it is
understood here the _Spaniard_, whose Countrey is on one side fenced by
the _Pyrenean_ Mountains; the rest is plain.


LXV.

    French.

    Dedans le coing de _Luna_ viendra rendre,
    Ou sera prins & mis en Terre estrange,
    Les fruits immeurs seront a grand esclandre,
    Grand vitupere, a l’un grande loüange.

    English.

    He shall come into the corner of _Luna_,
    Where he shall be taken and put in a strange Land,
    The green fruits shall be in great disorder,
    A great shame, to one shall be great praise.

ANNOT.

This Stanza hath relation and connexion to the precedent, and by it ought
to be understood, that the said _Æmathian_ or _Spaniard_ shall come as
far as the corner of _Luna_, wherein he shall be taken and sent into a
strange Countrey, at which time the green Fruits and Grass shall be much
damaged, for which one of the parties shall receive great shame, and the
other great praise. But what he meaneth by the Corner of _Luna_, I must
leave the judgement of it to the Reader, for I do ingeniously confess
that I neither know City nor Countrey of that name.


XLVI.

    French.

    Paix, union, sera & changement,
    Estats, Offices, bas hault, & hault bien bas,
    Dresser voiages, le fruit premier, torment,
    Guerre cesser, civils proces, debats.

    English.

    Peace, union, shall be, and mutation,
    States, and Offices, low high, and high low,
    A journey shall be prepared for, the first fruit, pains,
    War shall cease, as also, civil suits, and strifes.

ANNOT.

This is easie to be understood, many interpret it of the downfall of
_Rome_, at which time all quarrels both of Religion and States would be
laid aside, if the world were all of one mind.


LXVII.

    French.

    Du haut des Monts a lentour de _Dizere_,
    Port a la Roche _Valent_, cent assemblez,
    De _Chasteau-Neuf_, _Pierrelate_, en _Douzere_,
    Contre le _Crest_, _Romans_ soy assemblez.

    English.

    From the top of the Mountains about _Dizere_
    Gate at the Rock _Valence_, a hundred gathered together,
    From _Chasteau-Neuf_, _Pierrelate_, in _Douzere_
    Against the _Crest_, _Romans_, shall be gathered.

ANNOT.

This is a peculiar Prophecy for the Provinces of _Dauphiné_ and
_Languedoc_, in which all the Towns and Rivers here mentioned are
situated.


LXVIII.

    French.

    Du Mont _Aymar_ sera noble obscurcie,
    Le mal viendra au joint de _Saone_ & _Rhosne_,
    Dans bois cachez Soldats jour de _Lucie_,
    Qui ne fut onc un si horrible Throsne.

    English.

    From Mount _Aymar_ shall proceed a Noble obscurity,
    The evil shall come to the joyning of the _Saone_ and _Rhosne_,
    Soldiers shall be hid in the Wood on St. _Lucy_’s day,
    So that there was never such an horrid Throne.

ANNOT.

There is a notable fault in the impression of the first Verse of this
Stanza, for instead of Mount _Aymar_, it must be _Montlimar_, which is
a Town in _Provence_ or _Languedoc_, situated by the River _Rhosne_,
the sense therefore of this, is, that from _Montlimar_ shall proceed
some notable and obscure design, and that shall reach as far as _Lyons_,
which is the City where the _Saone_ and _Rhosne_ meet, and that for that
purpose, there shall be hidden a great many Souldiers in a Wood on St.
_Lucy_’s day, which is the _13th._ of _December_.


LXIX.

    French.

    Sur le Mont de _Bailly_ & la _Bresse_,
    Seront cachez de _Grenoble_ les fiers,
    Outre _Lyon_, _Vien._ cula si grand gresle,
    Langoult en Terre n’en cessara un tiers.

    English.

    Upon the Mount of _Bailly_, and the Countrey of _Bresse_,
    Shall be hidden the fierce ones of _Grenoble_,
    Beyond _Lyons_, _Vienna_, upon them shall fall such a hail,
    That languishing upon the ground, the third part shall not be left.

ANNOT.

The Mount _Bailly_, and the Countrey of _Bressia_, are by _Savoy_, in
which place (our Author saith) the fierce ones; that is, the stout men of
_Grenoble_, the chief Town of _Dauphiné_, shall be hidden, and that such
a Hail shall fall upon them, as not one third part shall be left.


LXX.

    French.

    Harnois trenchans dans les flambeaux cachez,
    Dedans _Lyon_ le jour du Sacrement,
    Ceux de _Vienne_ seront tretous hachez,
    Par les _Cantons_ Latins, _Mascon_ eront.

    English.

    Sharp Weapons shall be hidden in burning Torches,
    In _Lyons_ the day of the Sacrament,
    Those of _Vienna_ shall be all cut to pieces,
    By the Latin _Cantons_, after the example of _Mascon_.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth a notable Treason that shall be acted at _Lyons_, upon
the Sacraments day, otherwise called _Corpus Christi_ day, upon which the
_Roman_ Catholicks are wont to make a Procession with the Sacrament about
the Town, with abundance of burning Torches, of fearful bigness, insomuch
that some (as at _Angeirs_) require 20 or 24 men to carry them, in those
Torches (our Author saith) shall Weapons be hidden, by means of which the
fact shall be committed. The rest is easie.


LXXI.

    French.

    Au lieux Sacrés, animaux veus a _Trixe_,
    Avec celuy qui nosera le jour,
    A _Carcassonne_ pour disgrace propice,
    Sera posé pour plus ample sejonr.

    English.

    In the Sacred places, Animals shall be seen at _Trixe_,
    With him that shall not dare in the day,
    In _Carcassonne_ for a favourable disgrace,
    He shall be set to make a longer stay.

ANNOT.

Whether the Author did understand himself here I know not, I am sure I do
not; _Carcassonne_ is a City of _Languedoc_, and _Trixe_ is a barbarous
word.


LXXII.

    French.

    Encor seront les Saints Temples pollus,
    Et expilez par Senat _Tholosain_,
    _Saturne_ deux trois Siecles revolus,
    Dans _Auril_, _May_, gens de nouveau Levain.

    English.

    Once more shall the Holy Temples be polluted,
    And depredated by the Senate of _Thoulouze_,
    _Saturn_ two three Ages finished,
    In _April_, _May_, people of a new Leaven.

ANNOT.

This is, when the Planet _Saturn_ hath finished twice three Ages;
that is, 600 years from the time that this Prophecy was written, then
the Senates of _Thoulouze_, being men of a new Leaven (meaning being
Protestants) shall cause the _Romish_ Churches to be polluted and
depredated in the Months of _April_ and _May_.


LXXIII.

    French.

    Dans _Foix_ entrez Roy Cerulée Turban,
    Et regnera moins evolu _Saturne_,
    Roy Turban Blanc, _Bizance_ cœur ban,
    _Sol_, _Mars_, _Mercure_, pres la Hurne.

    English.

    In _Foix_ shall come a King with a Blew Turbant,
    And shall Reign before _Saturn_ is revolved,
    Then a King with a White Turbant shall make _Bizance_ to quake,
    _Sol_, _Mars_, _Mercury_, being near the top of the Mast.

ANNOT.

_Foix_ is a Countrey of _France_, near _Gascony_, where the Author saith,
a King with a Blew Turbant shall come, and shall govern less then an Age,
that is 100 years, after which another King with a White Turbant shall
come, and shall Conquer _Bizance_ (which in Latine is _Constantinople_)
the Blew or Green Turbant is attributed to the great _Turk_, and the
White one to the King of _France_, by whom the _Turks_ have a Prophecie,
their Monarchy shall be subverted.


LXXIV.

    French.

    Dans la Cité de _Fertsod_ homicide,
    Fait & fait multe Bœuf arant ne macter,
    Retour encore aux honneurs d’_Artemide_,
    Et a _Vulcan_ corps morts sepulturer.

    English.

    In the City of _Fertsod_ one murdered,
    Causeth a Fine to be laid for killing a plowing Oxe,
    There shall be a return of the honours due to _Artemide_,
    And _Vulcan_ shall bury dead bodies.

ANNOT.

What is that City of _Fertsod_, is hard to guess, there being none of
this name in _Europe_ that I know. The rest of the words are plain,
though the sense be abstruce enough, therefore we shall leave them to the
liberty of the Reader.


LXXV.

    French.

    De l’_Ambraxie_ & du pais de _Thrace_,
    Peuple par Mer, Mal, & secours _Gaulois_,
    Perpetuelle en _Provence_ la Trace,
    Avec vestiges de leur Coustumes & Loix.

    English.

    From _Ambraxia_, and from the Countrey of _Thracia_,
    People by Sea, Evil, and _French_ succours,
    The Trace of it shall be perpetual in _Provence_,
    The footsteps of their Customs and Laws remaining.

ANNOT.

What Countrey this _Ambraxia_ should be, is yet unknown, for my part I
take it to be a forged word, as for _Thracia_ it is a Countrey between
_Hungary_ and _Greece_.

Observe here that Evil is not an Epithete, to either People or Sea, but a
word of admiration by it self, as _malum_ in Latine, which is called _vox
admirantis_.


LXXVI.

    French.

    Avec le noir _Rapax_ & sanguinaire,
    Yssu du peaultre de l’inhumain _Neron_,
    Emmy deux Fleuves main gauche Militaire,
    Sera meurtry par _Joyn Chaulveron_.

    English.

    With the Black and bloody _Rapax_,
    Descended from the paultry of the inhumane _Nero_,
    Between two Rivers, on the left Military hand,
    He shall be murdered by _Joyne Caulveron_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie portendeth the death of a black, bloody, and ravenous man
(which in Latine is _Rapax_) who shall be murdered between two Rivers, by
one whose proper name shall be _Joyne Chaulveron_.


LXXVII.

    French.

    Le Regne prins le Roy conviera,
    La Dame prinse a mort jurez a sort,
    La vie a Royne Fils on desniera,
    Et la pellix au fort de la consort.

    English.

    The Kingdom being taken, the King shall invite,
    The Lady taken to death,
    The Life shall be denyed unto the Queens Son,
    And the Pellix shall be at the height of the Consort.

ANNOT.

You must observe, that there is a word false printed, which is _Pellix_,
instead of which should be _Pellex_, which in Latine signifieth a Whore
or Concubine.

The sense therefore of this is, that a certain King having taken another
Kingdom, shall put the Queen of it to death, as also her own Son, after
which, he shall make his Concubine Queen.


LXXVIII.

    French.

    La Dame _Grecque_ de Beauté laydique,
    Heureuse faite de proces innumerable,
    Hors translatée au Regne _Hispanique_,
    Captive prinse mourir mort miserable.

    English.

    The _Græcian_ Lady of exquisite Beauty,
    Made happy from innumerable quarrels,
    Being translated into the _Spanish_ Kingdom,
    Shall be made a Prisoner, and die a miserable death.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is concerning the Lady _Elizabeth_ of _France_, Daughter to
_Henry_ the II. and Sister to _Charles_ the IX. who being promised first
to _Don Carlo Infante_ of _Spain_, was afterwards Married to his Father
_Philip_ the II. at which the young man being vexed and discontented,
began to raise combustions in the State, for which, and his too much
familiarity with his Mother in Law, he was strangled by his Fathers
command, and she poisoned.


LXXIX.

    French.

    Le Chef de Classe par fraude, stratageme,
    Fera timides sortir de leurs Galeres,
    Sortis meurdris chef renieux de Cresme,
    Puis par l’Embusche luy rendront les salaires.

    English.

    The Commander of a Fleet by fraud and stratagem,
    Shall cause the fearful ones to come forth of their Galleys,
    Come out murdered, chief renouncer of Baptism,
    After that by an Ambuscado they’l give him again his salary.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are plain, the third signifieth, that these fearful
ones being come out of their Galleys, part of them shall be murdered, and
among them the Captain, a renouncer of his Baptism, or Renegado, and the
rest afterwards by an Ambuscado, shall requite in the same Coin those
that had used them so.


LXXX.

    French.

    Le Duc voudra les siens exterminer,
    Envoyera les plus forts, lieux estranges,
    Par tyrannie _Bize_ & _Luc_ ruiner,
    Puis les _Barbares_ sans Vin feront Vendanges.

    English.

    The Duke shall endeavour to exterminate his own,
    And shall send away the strongest of them into remote places,
    He shall also ruinate _Bize_ and _Luc_,
    The _Barbarians_ shall make Vintage without Wine.

ANNOT.

There is a great fault in the impression of the _French_ Copy in this
Stanza, which maketh the sense altogether inexplicable, it must then in
stead of _Bize_ and _Luc_, be written _Pise_ and _Lucques_, which are two
Towns in _Italy_, near the Duke of _Florence_’s Dominions; one of these
Towns, _viz._ _Pisa_ he hath taken already, and from a Common-Wealth made
it subject to himself; the other though several times attempted by him,
hath preserved its liberty to this day. The last Verse signifieth, that
after this is come to pass, the _Barbarians_, that is, the _Florentins
shall make Vintage without Wine_; that is, shall plunder and spoil at
their pleasure.


LXXXI.

    French.

    LeRoy rusé entendra ses Embusches,
    De trois quartiers Ennemis assaillir,
    Un nombre estrange Larmes de coqueluches,
    Viendra _Lamprin_ du traducteur faillir.

    English.

    The crafty King shall hear of his Ambuscadoes,
    And shall assail his Enemies on three sides,
    A strange number of Friers, mens Tears,
    Shall cause _Lamprin_ to desert the Traitor.

ANNOT.

The only difficulty here is to know who that _Lamprin_ should be, who
shall be diverted from following a Traitor (which he meaneth here by the
_French_ word _Traducteur_) and shall be diverted from it by the Tears of
Fryers, which are meant here by the ancient _French_ word _Coqueluches_,
which signifieth a Fryers Cool or Capuchon.


LXXXII.

    French.

    Par le Deluge & pestilence forte,
    La Cité grande de long temps Assiegée,
    La Sentinelle & Garde de main morte,
    Subite prinse mais de nul outragée.

    English.

    The great City having been long Besieged,
    By an Innundation and violent Plague,
    The Sentinal and Watch being surprised,
    Shall be taken on a sudden, but hurt by no body.

ANNOT.

This is very plain, if by the great City you understand _Paris_, who is
subject to frequent Innundations and Plagues.


LXXXIII.

    French.

    Sol Vingt de _Taurus_, si fort terre tremblera,
    Le grand Theatre remply ruinera,
    L’Air, Ciel, & Terre, obscurcir & troubler,
    Lors l’Infidele Dieu, & Saints voguera.

    English.

    The Sun being in the _20th_ of _Taurus_, the Earth shall so quake,
    That it shall fill and ruinate the great Theater
    The Air, the Heaven, & the Earth shall be so darkened, and troubled,
    That the unbelievers shall call upon God, and his Saints.

ANNOT.

This famous Earth-quake having not yet happened in _Europe_, it is like
to happen within few years, for our Authors Prophecies (by his own
confession) do not extend further than the year 1700.


LXXXIV.

    French.

    Roy exposé parfaira l’Hecatombe,
    Apres avoir trouve son Origine,
    Torrent ouvrir de Marbre & Plomb la Tombe,
    D’un grand _Romain_ d’Enseigne _Medusin_.

    English.

    The King exposed shall fulfill the Hecatombe,
    After he hath found out his Offspring,
    A Torrent shall open the Sepulcher, made of Marble and Lead,
    Of a great _Roman_, with a _Medusean_ Ensign.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is divided into two parts, The first two Verses are
concerning a King, who shall perform the Funeral Rites and Ceremonies
to his Parents, when he is come to the knowledge of them, having been
exposed for lost before.

The two last Verses are concerning an ancient Sepulcher of a _Roman_,
that shall be digged up and found out by a Torrent, and the Arms of the
said _Roman_ shall be something like the head of _Medusa_, whose Hairs
were Serpents, and was so fearful to behold, that by seeing of it, the
beholders were turned into stones.

    Passer _Guenne_, _Languedoc_, & le _Rhosne_,
    D’_Agen_ tenants, de _Marmande_ & la _Reole_,
    D’Ouvrir par foy parroy, _Phocen_ tiendra son Throne,
    Conflict aupres Saint _Pol_ de _Manseole_.

    English.

    They shall pass over _Gascony_, _Languedoc_, and the _Rhosne_,
    From _Agen_ keeping _Marmande_, and the _Reole_,
    To open the Wall by Faith, _Phocen_ shall keep his Throne,
    A Battle shall be by St. _Paul_ of _Manseole_.

ANNOT.

The whole of this Prophecie signifieth no more, but that an Army shall
pass through all these places, and that at last there will be a Battle
fought by that place, called St. _Paul de Manseole_.


LXXXVI.

    French.

    Du _Bourg la Reyne_ parviendront droit a _Chartres_,
    Et feront pres du _Pont Antony_ pose,
    Sept pour la paix cauteleux comme _Martres_,
    Feront entrée d’Armée a _Paris_ clause.

    English.

    From _Bourg la Reyne_ they shall come straight to _Chartres_,
    And shall make a stand near _Pont Antony_,
    Seven for Peace as crafty as _Martres_,
    They shall enter in _Paris_ besieged with an Army.

ANNOT.

_Bourg la Reyne_ is a little town within six Miles of _Paris_, _Chartres_
is the chief City of the Province _Beausse_, _Pont Antony_ is a little
Town between them both, so that the sense of the whole is this, that
seven men, crafty like _Martres_ (which are those _Russia_ Foxes that
afford the richest Furres, called _Martres Zibellines_) shall go from
_Bourg la Reyne_ to _Chartres_, making a little stay at _Pont Antony_,
and then shall come with an Army into _Paris_, which shall be besieged at
that time, I believe this Prophecy is come to pass already in the time of
the Civil Wars of _France_; but for want of the History I could not quote
the time.


LXXXVII.

    French.

    Par la Forest du _Touphon_ essartée
    Par Hermitage sera posé le Temple,
    Le Duc d’_Estampes_ par sa ruse inventée,
    Du _Montlehery_ Prelat donra exemple.

    English.

    By the Forrest _Touphon_ cut off,
    By the Hermitage shall the Temple be set,
    The Duke of _Estampes_ by his invented trick,
    Shall give example to the Prelat of _Montlehery_.

ANNOT.

Here is a fault in the Impression, for instead of _Touphon_, it must be
written _Torfou_, which is a Forrest some 30 Miles from _Paris_ towards
_Beausse_, near which is seated the Town of _Montlehery_, in the said
Forrest is seated an Hermitage, and not far from thence the City of
_Estampes_, which carryeth the Title of Dutchy; so that the sense of
it is this, that this Forrest being cut off (as it is now for the most
part) in the place where that Hermitage was, shall be built a Church or
Convent, as it is now _Cælestins friars_, called _Marcoussy_, and that
the said Hermitage shall be taken from the jurisdiction of the Town of
_Montlehery_, under which it was before.


LXXXVIII.

    French.

    _Calais_, _Arras_, secours a _Theroanne_,
    Paix & semblant simulera l’escoute,
    Soulde d’_Allobrox_ descendra par _Roane_,
    Destornay peuple qui defera la routte.

    English.

    _Calais_, _Arras_, shall give succours to _Theroanne_,
    Peace or the like, shall dissemble the hearing,
    Souldiers of _Allobrox_ shall descend by _Roane_,
    People perswaded, shall spoil the March.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy did happen in the time of _Henry_ the II. King of _France_,
about the year 1559.

The last Verse saith, that those two Towns _Calais_ and _Arras_ gave
succours to _Theroanne_, that is to the Countrey where _Therouenne_ was
seated, which was destroyed by _Charles_ the V. Emperour. This Countrey
was called _Ponthieu_, of which _Therouenne_ was the chief Town.

The second Verse doth determine the time whereabout this came to pass,
when he saith, _peace or the like shall dissemble the hearing_; because
in the year 1556. in the beginning of _February_ there was a Truce for
five years between the two Crowns of _France_ and _Spain_, concerning
the Low Countreys, and this Truce signified not much, nor was well
cemented, so that the Author saith, _Peace or the like shall dissemble
the hearing_; that is, shall fain not to hear that the Cardinal _Caraffa_
did endeavour in _France_ to have the Truce broken.

The third Verse is obscure, because of a fault in the Impression,
wherein they have put _Ronane_ instead of _Noanne_, that is _Hannone_ by
transposition of letters, but that being corrected, the Verse is clear,
supposing that _Philibertus Emanuel_ Duke of _Savoy_ was General of the
Army, against _France_ in the _Low-Countreis_, and wandering about to do
some notable exploit, he came down through the Province of _Hainault_,
called in Latine _Hannonia_, and came to _Mariembourg_, as if he would
have Besieged it, but after some light skirmishes he laid Siege to
_Rocroy_, and this is the meaning of the third Verse, when he saith,
_Souldiers of ~Allobrox~ shall descend by ~Noanne~_, that is, Souldiers
in the Army of the Duke of _Savoy_, which in Latine is _Allobrox_, came
down to _Mariembourg_, and turned back again to _Rocroy_.

The fourth Verse mentioneth what did happen at the Siege of _Rocroy_;
that place being not yet very well fortified; the King was unwilling to
put any of his best Souldiers therein, but the Duke of _Nevers_ undertook
the defence of it, which he did really and gloriously perform, in so
much, that the Duke of _Savoy_ was compelled to raise up the Siege, and
going back towards St. _Quentin_, he took _Vervins_ by storm, and gave
the booty of it to his Souldiers, who took heart upon it, having been
much discouraged before by the resistance of the Duke of _Nevers_. This
is the sense of the fourth Verse, _People persuaded shall spoil the
march_; that is, the people of _Rocroy_ persuaded to hold out by the
courage and presence of the Duke of _Nevers_, spoiled the march that the
Duke of _Savoy_ had propounded to himself, insomuch, that raising the
Siege he went to _Vervins_, and from thence to St. _Quentin_.


LXXXIX.

    French.

    Sept ans _Philip_ fortune prospere,
    Rabaissera des _Barbares_ l’effort,
    Puis son midy perplex rebours affaire,
    Jeune _Ogmion_ abysmera son fort.

    English.

    _Philip_ shall have seven years of prosperous fortune,
    Shall beat down the attempt of the _Barbarians_,
    Then in his Noon he shall be perplexed and have untoward business,
    Young _Ogmion_ shall pull down his strength.

ANNOT.

This Stanza was made concerning _Philip_ the II. King of _Spain_, who for
the first seven years that he came to his Crown, had prosperous fortune,
did brave exploits against the _Barbarians_, and chiefly in the person
of his Brother _Don Juan_ of _Austria_, who got the memorable Battle of
_Lapantho_ against the _Turks_, but in the middle of _his Noon_, that
is of his Age, fell into great perplexities and cross businesses, being
constrained to put his onely son _Don Carla_ to death, and to poison his
wife and after that never prospered, when young _Ogmion_ (that is _Henry_
IV. King of _France_) came to the Crown.

    Un Capitaine de la grand _Germanie_,
    Se viendra rendre par simulé secours,
    Au Roy des Roys, aide de _Pannonie_,
    Que sa revoke fera de sang grand cours.

    English.

    A Captain of the great _Germany_,
    Shall come to yield himself with a fained help,
    Unto the King of Kings, help of _Hungary_,
    So that his revolt shall cause a great bloodshed.

ANNOT.

_Pannonia_ in Latine is _Hungary_, there is nothing hard in this, unless
it be what he meaneth by the King of Kings, whether it be the great Turk
or the Emperour.


XCI.

    French.

    L’Horrible peste _Perynthe_ & _Nicopole_,
    Le _Chersonese_ tiendra & _Marceloine_,
    La _Thessalie_ naistera l’_Amphipole_,
    Mal incogneu & le refus d’_Antoine_.

    English.

    The horrid pestilence shall seize upon _Perynthe_ and _Nicopolis_,
    The _Chersonese_ and _Marceloine_,
    It shall waste _Thessalia_ and _Amphipolis_,
    An unknown evil and the refusal of _Antony_.

ANNOT.

There is several faults in the impression here, for instead of
_Perynthe_, it must be _Corinth_. For _Marceloine_, it must be
_Macedoine_: the substance of the whole is, that there shall be a great
plague in all these Countries of _Asia_. The refusal of _Antony_ is
foisted here to make up the rime with _Macedony_.


XCII.

    French.

    Le Roy voudra dans Cité neufve entrer,
    Par ennemis expugner l’on viendra,
    Captif libere, faulx dire & perpetrer,
    Roy dehors estre, loin d’ennemis tiendra.

    English.

    The King shall desire to enter into the new City,
    With foes they shall come to overcome it,
    The Prisoner being free, shall speak and act falsly,
    The King being gotten out, shall keep far from enemies.

ANNOT.

The sense of all these words so ill jointed, is no more but that a
certain King shall desire to enter into a new City, and there they shall
come and Besiege him, where he shall both act and speak deceitfully to
get his liberty, which having obtained, shall keep far from his foes.


XCIII.

    French.

    Les ennemis du Fort bien esloignez,
    Par Chariots conduits le Bastion,
    Par sur les Murs de _Bourges_ esgrongnez,
    Quand _Hercules_ battra l’_Hæmathion_.

    English.

    The enemies being a good way from the Fort,
    Shall upon Wagons be conducted to the Bulwark,
    From the top of _Bourges_ Walls they shall be cut less,
    When _Hercules_ shall beat the _Hæmathion_.

ANNOT.

_Bourges_ is the chief City of a Province in _France_ called _Berry_.

There is nothing difficult in this, but onely what he meaneth by
_Hercules beating the Æmathion_, unless by _Hercules_ he meaneth the
_French_, and by _Æmathion_ the _Spaniard_.


XCIV.

    French.

    Foibles Galeres seront unis ensemble,
    Ennemis faux, le plus fort en rempart,
    Foible assailies _Wratislavie_ tremble;

    English.

    Weak Galleys shall be united together,
    False enemies, the strongest shall be fortified,
    Weak assaults, and yet _Breslaw_ quaketh for fear,
    _Lubeck_ and _Misne_ shall take the part of the _Barbarians_.

ANNOT.

_Breslaw_, _Lubeck_ and _Misne_, are three Cities of _Germany_; the rest
is plain.


XCV.

    French.

    Le nouveau fait conduira l’exercite,
    Proche apamé jusque aupres du Rivage,

    English.

    The new man shall lead up the Army,
    Near _Apamé_, till near the Bank,
    Carrying succours of choice Forces from _Milan_,
    The Duke deprived of his eyes, and an Iron Cage at _Milan_.

ANNOT.

_Apamé_ is a barbarous word, at least I cannot tell what language it is,
the rest is plain enough, and signifieth that a Duke shall be deprived of
his eyes, and shall be put in an Iron Cage at _Milan_.


XCVI.

    French.

    Dans Cité entrer exercite desniée,
    Duc entrera par persuasion,
    Aux foibles portes clam Armée amenée,
    Mettront feu, mort, de sang effusion.

    English.

    The Army being denied the entrance of the City,
    The Duke shall enter by persuasion,
    To the weak Gates, _clam_ the Army being brought,
    Shall put all to fire and sword.

ANNOT.

_Clam_ here is in Latine _præposition_, signifying secretly; the rest is
easie.


XCVII.

    French.

    De Mer Copies en trois parts divisées,
    A la seconde les Vivres failliront,

    English.

    A Fleet being divided into three parts,
    The victuals will fail the second part,
    Being in despaire they’l seek the _Elysian_ Fields,
    And entring the breach first, shall obtain victory.

ANNOT.

A Fleet being divided into three parts, the second division shall fall
into want of victuals, for which being desperate, they shall attempt the
Town of the enemy, and shall enter it by the breach, and get the victory.


XCVIII.

    French.

    Les affligez par faute d’un seul taint,
    Contremenant a partie opposite,
    Aux _Lygonois_ mandera que contraint,
    Seront de rendre le grand chef de _Molite_.

    English.

    The afflicted want of one only died,
    Carrying against the opposite part,
    Shall send word to those of _Lyon_, they shall be compelled,
    To surrender the great chief of _Molite_.

ANNOT.

This is the most nonsensical thing that is in all the Book, for neither
the words nor the connexion is intelligible, therefore it being so much
out of the common road of our Author, I am apt to believe that it was at
first very falsly printed, and that those that came after, were loth to
alter it for the respect of antiquity.


XCIX.

    French.

    Vent _Aquilon_ fera partir le Siege,
    Par murs jetter cendres, chaulx, & poussiere,

    English.

    The North wind shall cause the Siege to be raised,
    They shall throw ashes, lime, and dust,
    By a rain after that shall be a trap to them,
    It shall be the last succours against their Frontiere.

ANNOT.

Here is described a notable stratagem of a Besieged Town, who against
rainy weather cast so much ashes, lime and dust, that the rain coming
thereupon, it made such a mire, as the Besiegers were not able to assault
it.

    English.

    In a Sea-fight, night shall be overcome,
    By fire, to the Ships of the West ruine shall happen,
    A new stratagem, the great Ship coloured,
    Anger to the vanquished, and victory in a Mist.

ANNOT.

He foretelleth of a Sea-fight in the night, wherein by the light of the
burning Ships night shall be overcome, the Ships that came from the West
shall be worsted, and by a stratagem of a great Ship painted in colours,
anger shall remain to the vanquished, and the victory shall be got in a
Mist.




THE PROPHECIES OF Michael Nostradamus.

_CENTURY_ X.


I.

    French.

    A l’Ennemy, l’ennemy foy promise,
    Ne se tiendra, les captifs retenus,
    Prins preme mort & le reste en chemise,
    Donnant le reste pour estre secourus.

    English.

    To the enemy, the enemy faith promised,
    Shall not be kept, the prisoners shall be detained,
    The first taken, put to death, and the rest stripped,
    Giving the remnant that they may be succoured.

ANNOT.

These words are plain, though the sense be a little intricated, and the
contents being of small concernments, deserve no further explanation.


II.

    French.

    Voile Gallere Voile nef Cachera,
    La grand Classe viendra sortir la moindre,
    Dix Naves proches le tourneront poulser,
    Grand vaincüe, unies a soy joindre.

    English.

    The Galley and the Ship shall hide their Sails,
    The great Fleet shall make the little one to come out,
    Ten Ships near hand, shall turn and push at it,
    The great being vanquished, they shall unite together.

ANNOT.

These are some particularities of a Sea fight between a great Fleet and a
small one, wherein he saith, that some had hid their Sails, belike they
were unwilling to come out of the Harbour and to fight; but he saith,
that the great Fleet will compel the little one to come out; but ten
great Ships will come to help the little Fleet, and after the great one
hath been overcome, will joyn themselves to the little Fleet.


III.

    French.

    En apres cinq troupeau ne mettra hors,
    Un fuitif pour _Penelon_ laschera,
    Faux murmurer secours venir par lors,
    Le Chef le Siege lors abandonnera.

    English.

    After that, five shall not put out his flock,
    He’l let loose a runnaway for _Penelon_,
    There shall be a false rumour, succours shall come then,
    The Commander shall forsake the Siege.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is either nonsensical or falsely printed, and what he meaneth
by _Penelon_, is utterly unknown.


IV.

    French.

    Sur la minuit conducteur de l’Armée,
    Se sauvera subit esvanovy,
    Sept ans apres la fame non blasmée,
    A son retour ne dira oncq ouy.

    English.

    About midnight the leader of the Army,
    Shall save himself, vanishing suddenly,
    Seven years after his fame shall not be blamed
    And at his return he shall never say yea.

ANNOT.

This is plain of a General of an Army, who shall forsake his Army,
and save himself, and yet seven years after when he cometh back, his
reputation shall be as clear, as if he never had committed such an errour.


V.

    French.

    _Albi_ & _Castres_ feront nouvelle ligue,
    Neuf _Arriens_, _Lisbonne_, & _Portuguez_,
    _Carcas._ _Thoulouze_, consumeront leur brigue
    Quand chef neuf monstre de _Lauraguez_.

    English.

    _Albi_ and _Castres_ shall make a new league,
    Nine _Arriens_, _Lisbonne_, and _Portuguez_,
    _Carcas._ _Thoulouse_, shall make an end of their confederacy;
    When the new chief shall come from _Lauragais_.

ANNOT.

_Albi_, _Castres_, _Carcassonne_, and _Thoulouse_, are Cities of
_Languedock_, which our Author saith, will enter into a confederacy among
themselves, and joyn with _Lisbon_ and the _Portuguez_, and this shall
happen when the general of the Army, shall be one born in _Lauragais_,
which is another of the same Province.


VI.

    French.

    _Gardon_ a _Nismes_ eaux si haut desborderont,
    Qu’on cuidera _Deucalion_ renaistre,
    Dans le _Colosse_ la pluspart fuiront,
    Vesta Sepulchre feu esteint apparoistre.

    English.

    _Gardon_ at _Nismes_, waters shall overflow so high,
    That they’l think that _Deucalion_ is born again,
    Most of them will run into the _Colossus_,
    And a Sepulchre, and fire extinguished, shall appear.

ANNOT.

Near _Nismes_ there is the River called _Gardon_, which cometh from St.
_Romans_, and dischargeth it self into the _Rhosne_ at _Beaucaire_, there
is to be seen in that City abundance of _Antiquitez_, which the _Goths_
had built 1150. years before; there is also many _Roman_ Antiquities,
as an _Amphitheater_, so well builded that neither the _Goths_ nor the
_Saracens_, nor _Attila_, nor _Charles Martel_, with all their power,
could not utterly demolish it. The Author nameth it _Colossus_, because
its building appeared like a _Colossus_ for solidity.

There is also an ancient Temple which is called the _Fountain_, builded
as a Quadrangle, and supported by two rows of great Pillars, which at
present is a Church of Nuns.

This being supposed, the River of _Gardon_ did overflow so much, that
its Waters joyning with that of a Flood that happened there the ninth
of _September_ 1557. every one thought that _Deucalion_ had been born
again. The Author saith this; because in the fables of the ancients.
_Deucalion_ is thought to be the Author of the Flood which _Ovid_
mentioneth. During this Flood which was like to overflow the Town, as
well as the Countrey, many did retire themselves into that Amphitheater.

And in that ancient Temple of the _Fountain_, the Waters overthrowing
a great many old buildings did discover abundance of Antiquities, and
amongst the rest one of those Lamps that burneth always, in the Sepulchre
of a _Vestal_, which went out as soon as it felt the fresh Air.

In confirmation of this, the History of _Provence_ saith, that the storm
began about five of the Clock in the Morning, and lasted till Eight
of the Clock at night, and that these waters did uncover abundance of
Antiquities that were hidden 1100. years before, as Pillars, Portico’s,
Medals, Jasper-stones, and serpentine-stones, pieces of broken Vessels,
Epitaphs, lodging Rooms, and Caves, and all other things that use to be
found in the ruines of a Palace.

There was also heard in the Air Dogs barking, Pillars of fire, Armed men
fighting, and were seen two Suns in the Clouds of the Colour of Blood,
all which were the sad presages of the Civil Wars of _France_ presently
after, and chiefly that of _Provence_.

The ninth Century in the ninth Stanza, speaketh almost the same, and
sheweth that _Nismes_ shall perish by Water.


VII.

    French.

    Le grand conflict qu’on appreste a _Nancy_,
    L’_Æmathien_ dira tout je soubmets,
    L’Isle _Britane_ par Vin Sel en solcy,
    _Hem. mi._ deux _Phi._ long temps ne tiendra _Mets_.

    English.

    A great War is preparing at _Nancy_,
    The _Æmathien_ shall say I submit to all,
    The _British_ Island shall be put in care by Salt and Wine,
    _Hem. mi._ two _Phi._ shall not keep _Mets_ long.

ANNOT.

_Nancy_ is the chief City of _Lorrain_, and by the _Æmathien_ is
understood the _French_, the _British_ Isle is _England_, which is said
here, shall come into great distress by Salt and Wine, because the
Countrey aboundeth in those two Commodities. The last Verse I do not
understand, save that _Mets_ is a great City in _Lorrain_.


VIII.

    French.

    _Index_ & _Poulse_ parfondera le front
    De _Senegalia_ le Comte a son Fils propre,
    La _Myrnamée_ par plusieurs de plain front,
    Trois dans sept jours blessez mort.

    English.

    _Index_ and _Poulse_ shall break the forehead,
    Of the Son of the Earl of _Senegalia_,
    The _Myrnamée_ by many at a full bout,
    Three within seven days shall be wounded to death.

ANNOT.

_Senegalia_ is a Town in _Italy_, all what can be gathered out of the
obscurity of this Stanza, is, that the son of the Earl of that Town shall
have his forehead broken, and within seven days after, three more shall
be wounded to death.


IX.

    French.

    De _Castilon figuieres_ jour de brune,
    De femme infame naistra Souverain Prince,
    Surnum de chausses per hume luy posthume,
    Onc Roy ne fut si pire en sa Province.

    English.

    Out of _Castilon figuieres_ upon a misty day,
    From an infamous woman shall be born a Soveraign Prince,
    His surname shall be from _Breeches_, himself a posthume,
    Never a King was worse in his Province.

ANNOT.

_Castilon figuieres_ is a petty Town in _Provence_, in which he saith
that a Soveraign Prince shall be born of an infamous Woman, and shall be
a posthume, which in Latine signifieth one that is born after his Fathers
death; he saith also that his name shall be derived from _Breeches_ and
that never a King was worse in his Countrey, whether by worse, he meaneth
in manners or fortune, I know not.


X.

    French.

    Tasche de murdre, enormes Adulteres,
    Grand ennemy de tout le genre humain,
    Que sera pire qu’ayeulx, Oncles ne Pere,
    En fer, feu, eau, sanguin & inhumain.

    English.

    Endeavour of Murder, enormous Adulteries,
    A great enemy of all mankind,
    That shall be worse then Grand-father, Uncle, or Father,
    In Iron, fire, water, bloody and inhumane.

ANNOT.

This Stanza as well as the next hath relation to the precedent, making
mention what a wicked person shall that Posthume be of which he spoke
before.


XI.

    French.

    Dessoubs _Jonchere_ du dangereux passage,
    Fera passer le posthume sa bande,
    Les Monts _Pyrens_ passer hors son bagage,
    De _Parpignan_ courira Duc a _Tende_.

    English.

    Below _Joncheres_ dangerous passage,
    The posthume shall cause his Army to go over,
    And his Baggage to go over the _Pyrenean_ Mountains,
    A Duke shalt run from _Perpignan_ to _Tende_.

ANNOT.

This is still concerning the same posthume or Bastard, who shall cause
his Army to pass at _Jonchere_, and his Bagage to go over the _Pyrenean_
Mountains, which parts _Spain_ from _France_, and that upon the fear
of him a Duke shall run from _Perpignan_, which is the chief City of
_Roussillon_ to _Tende_, which is a little Town in _Provence_.


XII.

    French.

    Esleu en Pape, d’Esleu sera mocqué,
    Subit soudain, esmeu prompt & timide,
    Par trop bon doux a mourir provoqué,
    Crainte estainte la nuit de sa mort guide.

    English.

    Elected for a Pope, from Elected shall be baffled,
    Upon a sudden, moved quick and fearful,
    By too much sweetness provooked to die,
    His fear being out in the night shall be Leader to his death.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was fulfilled in the person of the Cardinal _Santa
Severina_, who in the Conclave of Cardinals after the death of Pope
_Innocent_ IX. was Elected Pope, and presently after was baffled by the
same Cardinals, and _Clement_ the VIII. chosen in his place, for which
the other a little while after died for grief.


XIII.

    French.

    Soubs la pasture d’animaux ruminans,
    Par eux conduits au ventre _Herbi-polique_,
    Soldats cachez, les armes bruit menants,
    Non loin tentez de Cité _Antipolique_.

    English.

    Under the pasture of Beasts chewing the cud,
    Conducted by them to the _Herbi-polique_ belly,
    Souldiers hidden, the Weapons making a noise,
    Shall be attempted not far from _Antipolick_ City.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is, that some Souldiers disguised like Herds-men, shall
lead Oxen into a place where were hidden before Weapons in the Grass, but
the Weapons making a noise by their clashing they shall be discovered,
not far from a place that he calleth here _Antipolique_, purposely
to rime with _Herbipolique_ in _French_, which word _Herbipolique_
signifieth a Town of Pasture.


XIV.

    French.

    _Urnel_, _Vaucile_, sans conseil de soy mesmes,
    Hardy, timide par crainte prins vaincu,
    Accompagné de plusieurs putains, blesme,
    A _Barcelonne_ aux Chartreux convaincu.

    English.

    _Urnel_, _Vaucile_, without advice of his own,
    Stout and fearful, by fear taken and overcome,
    Pale, and in company of many Whores,
    Shall be convicted at _Barcelone_ by the Charterhouse.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is an Horoscope, which the Author made upon that Gentleman
named _Urnel Vaucille_, and signifieth that the said man should find
himself in such perplexity that he could not be able to take advice what
to do, and that fear should make him hide himself, to be apprehended, in
a place where he should be taken.

When he was taken, he was presently convicted of those crimes that he
was accused of: therefore the Officers of Justice did conduct him to the
Charter-house of _Barcelone_, which is four miles from the said Town, in
a place called _Campo alegre_, for the beauty and situation of it, to
that place many Whores did accompany him to receive the punishment they
had deserved, therefore the Author saith that he went thither pale, as
foreseeing the terrour of the punishment he was to undergo.


XV.

    French.

    Pere Duc vieux d’ans & de soif chargé,
    Au jour extreme fils desniant l’esguiere,
    Dedans le puis vif, mort viendra plongé,
    Senat au fils la mort longue & legere.

    English.

    A Father Duke, aged and very thirsty,
    In his extremity, his son denying him the Ewer,
    Alive into a Well, where he shall be drowned,
    For which the Senate shall give the son a long and easie death.

ANNOT.

It is a Duke very aged who shall die of a Dropsie, or of some other
burning disease, which will make him very thirsty, the Physitians shall
forbid any water to be given him, therefore this Duke shall press his son
very much to give him the Ewer, that he may drink his fill, but his son
refusing, the Father shall fall into such a rage, that being alone he
will go and throw himself into a Well, where he shall be drowned.

This unhappy death will be the cause of much murmuring, and the Senate
or Parliament of that place will make enquiry after it, by which enquiry
the son will be found guilty, therefore for his punishment, he shall be
condemned to a long and easie death, as to live all his days in some
Monastery.


XVI.

    French.

    Heureux au Regne de _France_ heureux de vie,
    Ignorant sang, mort, fureur, rapine,
    Par non flatteurs seras mis en envie,
    Roy desrobé, trop de foy en cuisine.

    English.

    Happy in the Kingdom of _France_, happy in his Life,
    Ignorant of blood, death, fury, of taking by force,
    By no flatterers shall be envied,
    King robbed, too much faith in Kitchin.

ANNOT.

This is a Prognostication of a King of _France_, who though happy in his
Reign and Life, and being given to no great vices, as blood, fury, or
taking by force, yet shall be much envied and robbed by his Subjects, and
chiefly by those he trusteth about his Kitchin.


XVII.

    French.

    La Reyne _Ergaste_ voiant sa fille blesme,
    Par un regret dans l’estomach enclos,
    Cris lamentables seront lors d’_Angolesme_,
    Et au germain mariage forclos.

    English.

    Queen _Ergaste_ seeing her Daughter pale,
    By a regret contained in her Breast,
    Then shall great cries come out of _Angolesme_,
    And the Marriage shall be denyed to the Cousin German.

ANNOT.

It is unknown what Queen he meaneth by the name of _Ergaste_; the rest is
easie. _Angolesme_ is a City of _Gascony_ or _Languedoc_.


XVIII.

    French.

    Le rang _Lorrain_ fera place a _Vendosme_,
    Le haut mis bas, & le bas mis en haut,
    Le fils d’_Hamon_ sera esleu dans _Rome_,
    Et les deux grands seront mis en defaut.

    English.

    The House of _Lorrain_ shall give place to _Vendosme_
    The high pulled down, the low raised up,
    The son of _Hamon_ shall be Elected into _Rome_,
    And the two great ones shall not appear.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses of this Prophecy were fulfilled in the time of
_Henry_ the third King of _France_, in whose time the Duke of _Guise_,
and House of _Lorrain_ were grown so powerful in _France_, that they
drove the King from _Paris_, and assumed themselves a rank and authority
over the Princes of the Blood, so that the King was forced to cause them
to be slain, after which _Henry_ IV. who was King of _Navarre_ and Duke
of _Vendosme_ took his place again as first Prince of the Blood.

The two last Verses are too obscure to be interpreted, and I believe
were onely forced by our Author to make up his Rime, as he hath done in
several other places.


XIX.

    French.

    Jour que sera pour Roine saluée,
    Le jour apres le salut, la Priere,
    Le compte fait raison & valbuée,
    Par avant humble oncques ne fut si fiere.

    English.

    The day that she shall be saluted Queen,
    The next day after the Evening Prayer,
    All accompts being summoned and cast up,
    She that was humble before, never was one so proud.

ANNOT.

It is a woman (be like of a small Fortune) who coming to be a Queen by
her humility, the next day after Evening Prayer she shall appear so
proud, as the like was never seen.


XX.

    French.

    Tous les amis qu’auront tenu party,
    Pour rude en lettres mis mort & saccage,
    Biens publiez par fixe, grand neanty,
    Onc _Romain_ peuple ne fut tant outrage.

    English.

    All the friends that shall have taken the part
    Of the Unlearned, put to death and robbed,
    Goods sold publickly by proclamation, a great man seized of them,
    Never _Roman_ people was so much abused.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is, that a great man that took part with all those that
were unlearned shall be put to death, and their goods praised and sold
publickly, upon which goods another great man shall seize, and this is to
be done in _Rome_.

There is fault in the Impression of the third _French_ Verse, for instead
of _fixe_ it must be _fisc_ and instead of _Neanty_ it must be _Nancy_.


XXI.

    French.

    Par le despit du Roy soustenant moindre,
    Sera meurdry luy presentant les bagues,
    Le Pere & Fils voulant Noblesse poindre,
    Fait comme a _Perse_ jadis firent les _Magues_.

    English.

    To spite the King, who took the part of the weaker,
    He shall be murdered, presenting to him Jewels,
    The Father and the Son going to vex the Nobility,
    It shall be done to them as the _Magi_ did in _Persia_.

ANNOT.

This is a King who with his son taking the peoples part against the
Nobility shall be killed, in presenting to him Jewels, and he and his son
shall be dealt with all as the _Magi_, that is the Grandees of _Persia_
used to do with their Kings, whom they were wont to murder, or depose.


XXII.

    French.

    Pour ne vouloir consentir au divorce,
    Qui puis apres sera cogneu indigne,
    Le Roy des Isles sera chassé par force,
    Mis a son lien qui de Roy n’aura signe.

    English.

    For not consenting to the divorce,
    Which afterwards shall be acknowledged unworthy,
    The King of the Island shall be expelled by force,
    And another subrogated, who shall have no mark of a King.

ANNOT.

This is plain concerning _England_ and the late calamities thereof,
when our gracious King for not consenting to the wicked factions of the
Parliament then, and that have been acknowledged so since, was expelled
by force, and an Usurpator that had not the least sign of a King sat in
his place.


XXIII.

    French.

    Au peuple ingrat faites les remonstrances,
    Par lors l’Armée se saisira d’_Antibe_,
    Dans larc _Monech_ feront les doleances,
    Et a _Freius_ l’un l’autre prendra ribe.

    English.

    The remonstrances being made to the ungrateful people,
    At that time the Army shall seize upon _Antibe_,
    In the River of _Monaco_ they shall make their complaints,
    And at _Freius_ both of them shall take their share.

ANNOT.

This signifieth that at the same time that the remonstrances shall be
made to an ungrateful people; the Army shall seize upon the Town of
_Antibe_, which is a Sea Town between _France_ and _Italy_, and that
there shall be great complaints at _Monaco_, which is another Sea Town
near it, and at the place called _Freius_, both parties shall either
agree, or divide their shares.


XXIV.

    French.

    Le captif Prince aux _Itales_ vaincu,
    Passera _Gennes_ par Mer jusque a _Marseille_,
    Par grand effort des forens survaincu,
    Sauf coup de feu, barril liqueur d’Abeille.

    English.

    The captive Prince vanquished in _Italy_,
    Shall pass by Sea through _Genoa_ to _Marseilles_,
    By great endeavours of forrain forces overcome,
    But that a Barrel of Honey shall save him from the fire.

ANNOT.

A Prince vanquished in _Italy_, and taken Prisoner shall come through
_Genoa_ to _Marseilles_, where he shall be once more overcome by
strangers, but that a Barrel of Honey shall save him from being burnt.
This is the sense of the words as near as I can judge, the judicious
Reader may make what construction he pleaseth upon them.


XXV.

    French.

    Par _Nebro_ ouvrir de _Brisanne_ passage,
    Bien esloignez _el tago fara muestra_,
    Dans _Pelligouxe_ sera commis l’outrage,
    De la grand Dame assise sur l’_Orchestra_.

    English.

    By _Nebro_ to open the passage of _Brisanne_,
    A great way off, _el tago fara muestra_,
    In _Pelligouxe_ the wrong shall be done
    Of the great Lady sitting in the _Orchestra_.

ANNOT.

Here once more I lost my Spectacles, and could not see through, therefore
I had rather be silent then coin lies, I shall only tell you, that
_orchestra_ in Latine is the seat wherein noble Personages sit at the
beholding of Stage-plays.


XXVI.

    French.

    Le successeur vengera son Beau frere,
    Occuper Regne soubs ombre de vengeance,
    Occis obstacle son sang mort vitupere,
    Long temps _Bretagne_ tiendra avec la _France_.

    English.

    The Successour shall avenge his Brother in Law,
    Shall hold by force the Kingdom, upon pretence of revenge,
    That hinderance shall be killed, his dead blood ashamed,
    A long time shall _Brittany_ hold with _France_.

ANNOT.

This is plain enough of it self, without any interpretation.


XXVII.

    French.

    _Charle_ cinquiesme & un grand _Hercules_,
    Viendront le Temple ouvrir de main bellique,
    Une Colonne, _Jules_ & _Ascan_ reculez,
    L’_E’pagne_, clef, Aigle neurent onc si grand pique.

    English.

    _Charles_ the Fifth, and one great _Hercules_,
    Shall open the Temple with a Warlike hand,
    One Colonne, _Julius_ and _Ascan_ put back,
    _Spain_, the Key, Eagle were never at such variance.

ANNOT.

_Charles_ the V. was the Emperour, and that great _Hercules_ was _Henry_
the II. King of _France_, whom he calleth _Hercules_, because he was
King of _France_, and the Author nameth often in his Stanzas the Kings
of _France Hercules_ or _Ogmions_, because that great Captain of the
Antiquity left his name glorious in the _Gaules_, whence the ancient
Historians have given him the name of _Hercules Gallicus_. _Henry_ the
II. also was not only an _Hercules_ by being King of _France_, but also a
great _Hercules_, because of his Warlike humour, and for his great feats
in Arms.

_To open the Temple_, signifieth to make War, because the _Romans_ in
ancient time were wont to shut the Temple of _Janus_ in time of Peace,
and kept it open during the War. _Cæsar Augustus_ did shut that Temple
once in his time, which was never done before but twice, the first under
_Numa Pompilius_, the second after the overcoming of _Charthage_.


XXVIII.

    French.

    Second & tiers qui font prime Musique,
    Sera par Roy en honneur sublimée,
    Par grasse & maigre presque a deny etique;
    Rapport de _Venus_ faux rendra deprimée.

    English.

    Second and third that make prime Musick,
    Shall by the King be exalted to honour,
    By a fat one, and a lean one, one in consumption,
    A false report of _Venus_ shall pull her down.

ANNOT.

Notwithstanding the obscurity of this sense, and the bad connexion of the
words, we may perceive that by this Stanza is meant, that a King having
two Mistresses shall exalt them in great honour, till by a report made
by a fat woman and a lean one, that is in a consumption, that the said
Ladies prove unfaithful to the King, he will depress them as low as they
were before.


XXIX.

    French.

    De _Pol Mansol_ dans Caverne caprine,
    Caché & pris extrait hors par la barbe,
    Captif mené comme beste mastine,
    Par _Begourdans_ amenée pres de _Tarbe_.

    English.

    From _Pol Mansol_ in a Goats Den,
    Hidden and taken, drawn out by the beard
    Prisoner, led as a Mastiff,
    By _Begourdans_ shall be brought near to _Tarbe_.

ANNOT.

Here and in some other places of this work is to be observed, that
the Author doth sometimes put two Towns instead of one, that he may
distinguish it from others of the same name, as here he calleth _Pol
Mansol_ to distinguish the Town of St. _Paul_, which is three Leagues
from the _Rhosne_, over against the Town of _Pont St. Esprit_, from that
which is in the lower parts of _Provence_.

The sense therefore of this Stanza is, that this _Begourdans_ (a proper
name of a man) shall pull out another by the beard, that was hidden in a
Goats Den, and shall lead him captive as far as _Tarbe_, which is another
Town of _Provence_.


XXX.

    French.

    Nepveu & sang du St. nouveau venu,
    Par le surnom soustient arcs & couvert,
    Seront chassez mis a mort chassez nu,
    En rouge & noir convertiront leur vert.

    English.

    Nephew and blood of the Saint newly come,
    By the surname upholdeth Vaults and Covering,
    They shall be driven, put to death, and driven out naked.
    They shall change their red and black into green.

ANNOT.

Here I confess to be at a loss, as may be a wiser man then I.


XXXI.

    French.

    Le Sainct Empire viendra en _Germanie_,
    _Ismaelites_ trouveront lieux ouverts,
    Asnes viendront aussy de la _Caramanie_,
    Les soustenans de Terre tous couverts.

    English.

    The Holy Empire shall come into _Germany_,
    The _Ismaelites_ shall find open places,
    Asses shall also come out of _Caramania_,
    Taking their part, and covering the Earth.

ANNOT.

By the _Ismaelites_ he meaneth the _Turks_, who brag to be descended from
_Ismael_.

_Caramania_ is a Province of _Turky_, so that the sense of this Stanza
is, that there shall be a great Invasion of the _Turks_ into _Germany_,
and that those of _Caramania_ with their Asses shall come to their help,
and shall be in such numbers, as that the Earth shall be covered with
them.


XXXII.

    French.

    Le grand Empire chascun en devoit estre,
    Un sur les autres le viendra obtenir,
    Mais peu de temps sera son Regne & estre,
    Deux ans aux Naves se pourra soustenir.

    English.

    The great Empire, every one would be of it,
    One above the rest shall obtain it,
    But his time and his Reign shall last little,
    He may maintain himself two years in his Shipping.

ANNOT.

This is plain enough without interpretation.


XXXIII.

    French.

    La faction cruelle a Robe longue,
    Viendra cacher soubs les pointus Poignards,
    Saisir _Florence_, le Duc & le _Diphlongue_,
    Sa discouverte par Immeurs & Flagnards.

    English.

    The cruel faction of long Robe,
    Shall come and hide under the sharp Daggers,
    Seize upon _Florence_, the Duke and the _Diphlongue_,
    The discovery of it shall be by Countrey fellows.

ANNOT.

This is the Prognostication of a conspiracy against the Duke and City
of _Florence_, by those of the long Gown, which shall be discovered by
Countrey fellows, that live in places without Walls.


XXXIV.

    French.

    _Gaulois_ qu’Empire par Guerre occupera,
    Par son Beau-frere mineur sera trahi,
    Par Cheval rude voltigeant trainera,
    Du fait le frere long temps sera hay.

    English.

    A _Frenchman_ who shall occupy an Empire by War,
    Shall be betrayed by his Brother in Law a Pupil,
    He shall be drawn by a rude prancing Horse,
    For which fact his brother shall be long hated.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth of a _Frenchman_, who shall by War obtain an Empire
or Kingdom, and shall be betrayed by his Brother in Law a Pupil, whom
afterwards he shall treacherously cause to mount a fierce prancing Horse,
who shall throw him down and drag him, for which the said King shall be
hated long after.


XXXV.

    French.

    Puisné Roial flagrant d’ardant libide,
    Pour se jouir de cousine _Germaine_,
    Habit de femme au Temple d’_Artemide_,
    Allant murdry par incogneu _du Marne_.

    English.

    The Kingly youngest son heated with burning lust,
    For to enjoy his Cosen German,
    Shall in womans apparrel go to the Temple of _Artemis_;
    Going, shall be murdered by unknown _du Marne_.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the younger son of a King, who being extreamly in
love with his Cosen German, shall disguise himself in a womans apparel,
and shall go so disguised to the Temple of _Artemide_ (that is of some
Church Dedicated to the Virgin _Mary_) to meet her, but in going, shall
be murdered by an unknown man named _du Marne_.


XXXVI.

    French.

    Apres le Roy du Sud guerres parlant,
    L’Isle _Harmotique_ le tiendra a mespris,
    Quelques ans bons rongeant un & pillant,
    Par tyrannie a l’Isle changeant pris.

    English.

    After that the King of the South shall have talked of Wars,
    The _Harmotick_ Island shall despise him,
    Some good years gnawing one and plundering,
    And by tyranny shall change the price of the Island.

ANNOT.

The two first Verses are concerning _Philip_ the II. King of _Spain_,
who is called here the King of the _South_, whom after his vain and
frustrated Invasion of 88. the _Harmotique_ Island (that is _England_)
shall deride, and he after that shall have some good years, that is
of Peace, still pillaging and plundering his Subjects, and shall
change the price of _England_, that is, make it of a higher value, and
more flourishing then ever it was before, as it did prove in Queen
_Elizabeth_’s time.


XXXVII.

    French.

    Grande assemblée pres du Lac du _Borget_,
    Se rallieront pres de _Montmelian_,
    Passants plus outre pensifs feront projet,
    _Chambray_, _Morienne_, combat Saint _Julian_.

    English.

    A great assembly of people near the Lake of _Borget_,
    Will go and gather themselves about _Montmelian_,
    Going beyond, they shall make an enterprize,
    Upon _Chambery_, _Moriene_, and shall fight at St. _Julian_.

ANNOT.

This Lake of _Borget_ is in _Savoy_, as also _Montmelian_, _Chambery_,
_Moriene_, and St. _Julian_; the meaning of it then is, that a great Army
shall be gathered about that Lake, which shall go through _Chambery_,
_Moriene_, and _Montmelian_, and shall fight at St. _Julian_.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    Amour alegre non loin pose le Siege,
    Au Saint _Barbar_ seront les Garnisons,
    _Ursins_, _Hadrie_ pour _Gaulois_ feront plaige.
    Pour peur rendus de l’Armée, aux _Grisons_.

    English.

    Cheerful love doth lay Siege not far,
    The Garrisons shall be at Saint _Barbar_,
    _Ursini_, _Hadria_ shall be sureties for the _French_,
    And many for fear shall go from the Army to the _Grisons_.

ANNOT.

The first two Verses are inexplicable; the two last signifie that there
shall be an Army of _Frens_, with whom _Hadria_ (that is _Venice_) and
the _Ursini_ the noblest Family in _Italy_ shall take part, insomuch,
that many of the contrary party shall run for fear to the _Grisons_,
which is a Nation dwelling in the _Valteline_ and other Countreis there
about, between the _Venetians_ and the _Switzers_.


XXXIX.

    French.

    Premier fils veusve malheureux mariage,
    Sans nuls enfans deux Isles en discord,
    Avant dixhuit incompetant Aage,
    De l’autre pres plus bas sera l’accord.

    English.

    Of the first son a widow, an unhappy match,
    Without any Children, two Islands at variance,
    Before eighteen an incompetant Age,
    Of the other lower shall be the agreement.

ANNOT.

Although the words be intricate, nevertheless the sense is plain,
concerning _Francis_ the II. King of _France_, who being married
young, and before he was 18. years of Age, to _Mary Stuart_ Queen
of _Scotland_, died presently after, and left her a widow, and also
_England_ and _Scotland_ (which he calleth here two Islands) at variance
among themselves; of the last Verse the sense is very obscure, and hath
relation to what did happen afterwards to the said _Mary_ Queen of
_Scots_ and Dowager of _France_.


XL.

    French.

    Le jeune nay au Regne _Britannique_,
    Qu’aura le Pere mourant recommandé,
    Iceluy mort _Londre_ donra topique,
    Et a son fils le Regne demandé.

    English.

    The young man born to the Kingdom of _Britanny_,
    Whom his Father dying shall have recommended,
    After his death _London_ shall give him a topick,
    And shall ask the Kingdom from his son.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is plain, concerning his Majesty King _Charles_ II.
now Reigning, who having been recommended by his dying Father to his
Subjects, presently after his death they turned tail, and took the
Kingdom from him for a good while.


XLI.

    French.

    En la frontiere de _Caussade_ & _Charlus_,
    Non gueres loing du fond de la valée,
    De _Ville Franche_ Musique a son de Luths,
    Environnez Combouls & grand myrtée.

    English.

    Upon the Frontiere of _Caussade_ and _Charlus_,
    Not far from the bottom of the Valley,
    Of _Ville Franche_ there shall be Musick of Lutes,
    Great dancing and great company of people met together.

ANNOT.

_Caussade_, _Charlus_, and _Villefranche_ are little Towns in _Provence_,
not far one from another; the rest is easie.


XLII.

    French.

    Le Regne humain d’Angelique geniture,
    Fera son Regne, paix, union tenir,
    Captive guerre demy de sa closture,
    Long temps la paix leur fera maintenir.

    English.

    The humane Reign of an Angelical brood,
    Shall cause his Reign to be in peace and union,
    Shall make War, captive shutting it half up,
    He shall cause them to keep peace a great while.

ANNOT.

This is only a foretelling of some Gallant Prince, who shall maintain his
Subjects in great peace and tranquility.


XLIII.

    French.

    Le trop bon temps, trop de bonté Roiale,
    Faits & desfaits prompt, subit, negligence,
    Leger croira faux, despouse loiale,
    Luy mis a mort par sa benevolence.

    English.

    The time too good, too much of Royal bounty,
    Made and unmade, nimble, quick, negligence,
    Fickle shall believe false o’ his loyal Spouse,
    He shall be put to death for his good will.

ANNOT.

This is concerning another King, who through his too much goodness,
simplicity and negligence, shall make and unmake those about him, and
being fickle, shall believe false reports, made concerning his own wife;
and at last by his to much goodness, shall be put to death.


XLIV.

    French.

    Par lors qu’un Roy sera contre les siens;
    Natif de _Blois_ subjuguera _Ligueres_,
    _Mammel_, _Cordube_, & les _Dalmatiens_,
    Des sept puis l’ombre a Roy estrennes & _Lemures_.

    English.

    At that time that a King shall be against his own,
    One born at Blois shall subdue the _Ligures_,
    _Mammel_, _Cordua_ and the _Dalmatians_,
    After that the shadow of the seven shall be to the King a new-years
      gift and Hoggoblins.

ANNOT.

_Blois_ is a City in _France_; _Ligures_ are the _Genoeses_, in Latine
called _Ligures_; as for _Mammel_ I cannot tell what to make of it;
_Cordua_ is a City of _Spain_, and the _Dalmatians_ is a Nation near the
_Adriatick_ Sea, and under the _Venetians_; I leave the interpretation of
the last Verse to the ingenious Reader.


XLV.

    French.

    Lombre du Regne de _Navarre_ non vray,
    Fera la vie de sort illegitime,
    La vers promis incertain de _Cambray_,
    Roy d’_Orleans_ donra mur legitime

    English.

    The shadow of the Reign of _Navarre_ not true,
    Shall make the life of illegitimate chance,
    The uncertain allowance from _Cambray_,
    King of _Orleans_ shall give a lawfull Wall.

ANNOT.

The _Reign_ or Kingdom of _Navarre_ is called _not true_, because the
King of _Spain_ doth possess it, and not the King of _France_, who is
the lawful King thereof, as also in regard of the Kings of _France_, and
before of _Jane_ of _Albret_, and _Antony_ of _Bourbon_.

This Kingdom being _not true_ in regard of the said ones, the title and
quality is called here _shadow_. The Author saith that the quality of the
King of _Navarre_ _shall make the life of illigitimate chance_, because
after the death of _Francis_ the II _Catherine_ of _Medicis_ being not
opposed in the Regence by _Antony_ of _Bourbon_ King of _Navarre_, she
was willing to gratifie him in what she could.

And because his Brother _Lewis_ Prince of _Condé_ had been condemned to
death, and not executed, it was a fair occasion for her to shew the King
of _Navarre_ how much she did defer to him. Therefore twelve days after
the death of King _Francis_, he was freed out of Prison, and was admitted
to justifie himself under the King of _Navarre_’s Bail.

Thus the _shadow of the Kingdom of ~Navarre~ not true_, did cause the
life of a Prince to be saved, but that life was illegitimate, _and that
Kingdom not true by chance_, that is, by accident, because of the death
of King _Francis_.

Leaving off the third Verse to be explained after the fourth; _King_
(saith the Author) _shall give_ Orleans _for legitimate_, because
_Charles_ the IX. who during the life of _Francis_ the II. did bear the
title of Duke of _Orleans_, did succeed his Brother; thus the Verse saith
that _Orleans shall give a King for legitimate_.

Now for the third Verse, you must suppose that by the Treaty at _Madrid_
1526. and after this by that of _Cambray_, the King _Francis_ the I. did
part with the Sovereignty of _Flanders_, and of all the _Low Countreis_
in favour of _Charles_ the V. Emperour, it is of that _uncertain
allowance_ of Cambray, of which the Author talketh here, and saith, that
in that time _viz._ of the death of _Francis_ the II. that _allowance
shall be uncertain_, because _Francis_ the I. having no power of himself
to renounce the rights and dependance of the Crown of _France_, the
Parliament that was assembled then, would have made void that _allowance_
without breaking the Peace, declaring that the Kings of _France_ ought
to preserve the right they had upon the _Low-Countreis_, and to require
them again upon any occasion, and upon that _France_ did not refuse the
Election which the _Low-Countreis_ made of the Duke of _Alencon_ for
their Sovereign Prince and Duke of _Brabant_.

    Vif sort mort de l’or vilain indigne,
    Sera de _Saxe_ non nouveau Electeur,
    De _Brunswick_ mandra d’amour signe,
    Faux le rendant au peuple seducteur.

    English.

    The living receives his death from Gold, infamous slut!
    Shall be of _Saxony_ not the new Elector,
    From _Brunswick_ shall come a sign of love,
    Falsly persuading the people that he is a seductor.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning an old Elector of _Saxony_, who being in
health before, shall die suddenly, being poisoned in a golden Cup by a
woman, whom he calleth here _infamous slut_.

And that from _Brunswick_ (a Countrey adjacent to _Saxony_) shall come a
Messenger, upon pretence of Love, who shall persuade the people that the
said Elector was a Seducer.


XLVII.

    French.

    De _Bourze_ Ville a la Dame _Guyrlande_,
    L’on mettra sus par la trahison faite,
    Le grand Prelat de _Leon_ par _Formande_,
    Faux Pellerins & Rauisseurs deffaite.

    English.

    From _Bourze_ City belonging to the Lady _Garlant_,
    They shall impose by a set treason,
    The great Prelate of _Leon_ by _Formande_,
    False Pilgrims and Ravishers destroyed.

ANNOT.

I believe that there is a fault here in the impression, and that instead
of _Bourze_ it must be _Bourges_, which is a famous City in _France_,
and Capitol of the Province of _Berry_, for I do not know any Town in
_Europe_ called _Bourze_. What he meaneth by the Lady _Garlant_ is
unknown. I believe also that instead of _Leon_ it should be _Lyon_, which
is another famous City, and the first Archbishoprick of the said Kingdom.
_Formande_ is a barbarous word, and I believe put in only to make up
the Rime, as he hath done in several other places, as much then as can
be gathered out of the sense is this, that from that City _Bourges_,
which usually is a Dowry for a Queen of _France_, which is called here
_Garlant_, shall a treason be hatched against the Archbishop of _Lion_,
which I suppose came to pass in the time of _Henry_ the III. when _Peter_
of _Pinac_ Archbishop of the said _Lion_, being accused by the Deputies
of _Bourges_ for siding with the League, escaped narrowly to be killed,
when the Duke of _Guise_ and the Cardinal his brother were. Queen
_Catherine_ of _Medicis_ the Kings Mother having then the said Province
and Town of _Bourges_ for her jointure.

The last Verse hath no relation to the three foremost, and hath its
interpretation by it self, which is plain enough.


XLVIII.

    French.

    Du plus profond de l’_Espagne_ ancienne,
    Sortants du bout & des fins de l’_Europe_,

    English.

    From the utmost part of old _Spain_,
    Going out of the extremities of _Europe_,
    He that troubled the travellers by the Bridge of _Laigne_,
    Shall have his great Troop defeated by another.

ANNOT.

Every Traveller knoweth that _Castille_ (which is taken here for _Spain_)
is divided into two parts _viz._ _Castilia la Vecchia_, and _Castilia la
Nuova_, our Author then saith that out of _Castilia la Vecchia_, which
is situated at the further end of _Europe_ on that side, shall come a
band of men, who shall destroy the Thieves that robbed and vexed the
Travellers by the Bridge of _Laigne_, which it seemeth was an infamous
place for robbing.


XLIX.

    French.

    Jardin du Monde aupres de Cité neufve,
    Dans le chemin des Montagnes cavées,
    Sera saisi & plongé dans la Cuve,
    Beuvant par force eaux Soulphre envenimées.

    English.

    Garden of the World, near the new City,
    In the way of the digged Mountains,
    Shall be seized on, and thrown into the Tub,
    Being forced to drink Sulphurous poisoned waters.

ANNOT.

This word _Garden of the World_, doth signifie a particular person,
seeing that this _Garden of the World_ was seized on and poisoned in a
Tub of Sulphurous water, in which he was thrown.

The History may be this, that _Nostradamus_ passing for a Prophet and a
great Astrologer in his time, abundance of people came to him to know
their Fortunes, and chiefly the Fathers to know that of their Children,
as did Mr. _Lafnier_, and Mr. _Cotton_, Father of that renowned Jesuit of
the same name, very like then that Mr. _du Jardin_ having a son did ask
_Nostradamus_ what should become of him, and because his son was named
_Cosmus_, which in Greek signifieth the World, he answered him with these
four Verses.

_Garden of the World_, for _Cosmus of the Garden_, In his travels shall
be taken hard by the New City, in a way that hath been digged between the
Mountains, and there shall be thrown in to a Tub of poisoned Sulphurous
water to cause him to die, being forced to drink that water which those
rogues had prepared for him.

Those that have learned the truth of this History, may observe it here.
This ought to have come to pass in the last Age, seeing that the party
mentioned was then born when this Stanza was written, and this unhappy
man being dead of a violent death, there is great likelyhood, that he was
not above forty years old.

There is another difficulty, to know which is that new City, there being
many of that name in _Europe_, nevertheless the more probable is, that
there being many Knights of _Maltha_ born in _Provence_ (the native
Countrey of our Author) it may be believed that by the new City he
meaneth the new City of _Maltha_ called _la Valete_, hard by which there
is paths and ways digged in the Mountains, which Mountains are as if it
were a Fence and a Barricado against the Sea, or else this _Cosmus_ might
have been taken by Pyrats of _Algiers_, and there in the new City of the
_Goulette_ be put to death in the manner aforesaid.

    English.

    The _Maes_ by day in the Land of _Luxembourg_,
    Shall discover _Saturn_, and three in the _Lurne_,
    Mountain and plain, Town, City, and Countrey Town,
    A _Lorrain_ flood, treason by a great _hurne_.

ANNOT.

The _Maes_ is a River that runneth through a part of _Lorrain_ and
_Luxembourg_; as for the words _Lurne_ and _hurne_ I do not understand
them, neither do I think they are to be found in all the _French_
Language, both obsolete and modern; all what I can gather out of this,
is, that a great overflowing of the River _Maes_, shall be both in
_Luxembourg_ and _Lorrain_, insomuch that three Leaden Mines (which is
meant here by _Saturn_) shall be discovered, and after that, a great
Treason shall happen in the said _Lorrain_.

Transcriber’s Note: An English version was omitted from this printing,
but the annotation below is an accurate enough (if not very poetic)
translation.

ANNOT.

The sense of this is, that the lower _Lorrain_ and _Germany_ being united
together, shall have War with the other three Nations, of _Picards_,
_Normans_, and _Manceaux_, which having Besieged a Town, shall constrain
the _Lorrainers_ and _Low-germans_, to unite themselves with the Cantons
of _Switzerland_.

    English.

    In the place where _Laye_ and _Scelde_ are united,
    Shall the Nuptials be, that were long a doing.
    In the place of _Antwerp_ where they draw the grape,
    The young unspotted will comfort the old Age.

ANNOT.

There is fault in the Impression, for instead of _Laye_ it must be _Lis_,
which is a River that runneth through _Flanders_, and dischargeth it self
into the _Scelde_, which is the River that passeth at _Antwerp_, the
sense therefore of this Prophecy is, that in the place where the River of
_Lis_ joyneth with the _Scelde_, there shall the Nuptials be consummated
that were long a doing, and the place of _Antwerp_, where they unload the
Wines, there shall a young unspotted Lady Marry, and comfort an old man.

    The greatest less shall remain watching,
    The great _Selin_ shall be no more their Patron,
    And shall call it fire, pelte, white, route.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning the _Turkish_ Empire, where three of the
great _Turks_ Concubines, which in Latine are called _Pellices_, shall
make War one against another, the great _Turk_ himself favouring neither
party.

    English.

    Born in this world from a stolen Concubine,
    Set up at two heights by the sad news,
    Shall be taken Prisoner among the Enemies,
    And brought to _Malines_ and _Bruxelles_.

ANNOT.

This is concerning some Lady of quality, born of a Concubine, who
shall be set up by reason of some sad news that shall be brought,
and afterwards shall be taken Prisoner, and carryed to _Malines_ and
_Bruxelles_, two Cities of the Low-Countreys.

    English.

    The unhappy Nuptials shall be celebrated,
    With great joy, but the end shall be unhappy,
    Husband and Mother shall scorn _Nore_,
    The _Phybe_ dead, and _Nore_ more pitifull.

ANNOT.

If by _Phybe_ we understand the Admiral of _Chastillon_, and by _Nore_,
Queen _Margaret_ of _Valois_, the rest will be easie. For in the year
1572. a Match was made between _Henry_ the IV. then King of _Navarre_,
chief of the Protestant party, and _Margaret_ of _Valois_, Sister to
_Charles_ the IX. to this Wedding were the chief of the Protestant party
invited, who were there Massacred, and among the rest _Gaspard_ of
_Coligny_, Lord of _Chastillon_, and Admiral of _France_, whom he calleth
here _Phybe_. And when he saith, that _Husband and Mother shall scorn
~Nore~_, he sheweth the slight Opinion and regard that the Queen Mother
had for her Daughter, and _Henry_ the IV. for his Wife, whom he after
repudiated.

    Royal Prelate bowing himself too much,
    A great flood of Blood shall come out of his mouth,
    The _English_ Reign by Reign respited,
    A great while dead, alive in _Tunis_ like a Log.

ANNOT.

A Prelate, is a man of eminent dignity in the Church, the Royal prelate
must be a Churchman of the Royal Blood, who bowing himself too much,
shall fall into an Hæmorhagie or Flux of Blood at his Mouth. The third
Verse signifieth, that the Kingdom of _England_ shall be relieved from
some distress by another Kingdom or Prince that had been a Slave a great
while at _Tunis_, and lyen there, _dead alive like a Log of Wood_.


LVII.

    The exalted shall not know his Scepter
    He shall put to shame the young Children of the greatest,
    Never was one more dirty and cruel,
    He shall banish to Black death their Spouses.

ANNOT.

This is concerning a great Tyrant, who being exalted to the dignity of a
King, shall not know how to govern; but shall slight and put to shame the
Children of the greatest Nobility, and shall banish their Wives out of
the Land; this hath a relation to the late Tyrant _Cromwell_.


LVIII.

    Au temps du dueil que le _Selin_ Monarque,

    English.

    In the time of mourning, when the Monarch _Selin_,
    Shall make War against the young _Æmathien_,
    _France_ shall quake, the Ship shall be in danger,
    _Phocens_ shall be attempted, the business shall be in the West.

ANNOT.

You must observe here, that by _Æmathien_ the Author meaneth the King of
_France_, as he doth in many other places; and by _Selin_, he meaneth the
great _Turk_, because such was the name of him that lived in his time,
this being presupposed the meaning of this is, that the great _Turk_
shall fight against the King of _France_, and shall attempt _Phocens_,
which is _Marseilles_, as being a Colony of the old _Phocenses_ in
_Græcia_, which shall cause all _France_ to quake, and the Ship to be in
danger, which is _Paris_, who beareth a Ship for its Arms.

    English.

    In _Lyons_ five and twenty of a breadth
    Five Citizens _Germans_, _Bressans_, _Latines_,
    Under Noblemen shall conduct a long Train,
    And shall be discovered by the barking of Mastiffs.

ANNOT.

The Marshal of St. _André_, Governour of _Lyon_ being absent, the
Protestants undertook the taking of it, at the solicitation of some
principal Lords at Court, among whom were named the Prince of _Condé_,
and the Vidame of _Chartres_, _Francis_ of _Vendosme_, Knight of the
Order. The Abbot of _Savigny_, who did supply the place of the Governour,
and was named _Antony_ of _Albon_, since that Archbishop of _Arles_,
having discovered this Conspiracy, went to surprise the undertakers, but
as he was going upon the night of the 5 of _September_, he met with some
of the confederates upon the Bridge of _Saone_, which made him retreat
with some loss.

The next day having gathered more Forces, he took three of them that were
strangers and young, the rest escaping, those three were hanged the next
_Saturday_, which was the 7 of that Month.

The Marshal being come to Town, there was Execution made upon some of the
Inhabitants, to the number of 4 that were hanged.

After that there were informations made concerning the Authors and
Abettors of the said conspiracy, and many other Citizens and strangers
were put to Prison, and besides them the Vidame of _Chartres_, who was
carryed to _Paris_, and put into the _Bastille_, and after that in
the _Tournelles_, where he died before his process was ended, the _23
December 1560_.

It is what our Author saith in this stanza; in the first Verse he saith,
that there were _five and twenty of a breadth_, of whose five and twenty
there was _five Citizens of the Town_, and the rest were _Germans,
Bressans and Italians_, of these Citizens 4 were hanged, and three of the
strangers.

Those 25 undertakers, of which the Author saith, that _under Noblemen
they shall conduct a long Train_; that is, that under the support and
favour of many Noblemen, they would undertake a thing that should not end
so soon as it proved afterwards; for although this enterprise did fail,
yet was the beginning of horrid combustions that followed afterwards.

This enterprise it seemeth was discovered by barking of Mastiffs.

The Apology for the City of _Lyon_ treateth at large of this, and nameth
all those conspirators, who for the most part were of _Germany_ and
_Geneva_.

    _Savona_, _Sienna_, _Capoua_, _Modena_, _Maltha_,
    Upon them blood and sword for a new years-gift,
    Fire, Earth-quake, water, unhappy _nolte_.

ANNOT.

All these Cities are situated by the _Mediterranean_ Sea, and most of
them upon that part of it, which is called the River of _Genoa_, and
are threatned here by all the plagues above mentioned; as for the
word _nolte_ it is a barbarous one, forced here to make up the Rime in
_French_.

    The conspirators discovered by a Matron.

ANNOT.

It seemeth that there will be a conspiracy of some men out of all the
above mentioned Cities, to surrender _Hungary_ (which in Latine is called
_Pannonia_) to the great Turk, but that conspiracy shall be discovered by
a Matron, that is, a grave ancient Woman.

    Chief _Bizantin_, _Sallon_ of _Sclavonia_,
    Shall come to turn them to the _Arabian_ Religion.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to have a relation to the precedent, and that near that
place he calleth _Sorbin_, preparations shall be made to Invade
_Hungary_, but they shall have notice of it by some body of _Buda_.

He that is called here _Chief Bizantin_, is the great Turk or his
grand Vizir, who hath his abode in _Constantinople_, anciently called
_Bizantium_.

    Shall make green again the Physical help,
    The Kings Son dead, by the death of two _Herons_,
    _Arabia_ and _Hungary_ shall go the same way.

ANNOT.

The meaning of this is, that when those three Cities named in the first
Verse shall have need of succours, and that a Kings Son shall die in
flying two _Herons_, then shall _Arabia_ and _Hungary_ be under the same
Master.

    When the great Duke shall go upon the Chariot,
    To change the Siege near _Venice_ he goeth about,
    When _Colonne_ shall change at _Rome_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy seemeth to portend the change of the See of _Rome_ in some
place near to _Venice_, and this is to happen when the great Duke of
_Tuscany_ shall ascend upon a Triumphant Chariot, and that the House of
_Colonne_ (which is the more powerfull in _Rome_) shall take his part.

    O great _Rome_ thy ruine draweth near,
    Not of thy Walls, of thy blood and substance,
    The sharp by Letters shall make so horrid a notch,
    Sharp Iron thrust in all to the haft.

ANNOT.

This is a confirmation of the foregoing Prophecy, by which it is said
that the destruction of _Rome_ shall not be in _her Walls, blood or
substance_, but onely by Letters or Doctrine that shall put quite down
the _Roman_ Religion.

    The Island of _Scotland_ shall catch thee by a frost,
    King and Reb. shall have so false an Antichrist,
    As will put them altogether by the ears.

ANNOT.

I conceive this Prophecy can be appropriated to no body better then
_Oli. Cromwel_, who is called here _the Chief of ~London~ by Reign of
~America~_, that is, by Reign of confusion, whose projects and treasons
were all brought to nought, by the victorious _Mars_ of the ever renowned
General _Monck_, who came with his Army from _Scotland_ to _London_ in
the Winter time, he is called also a false Antichrist, because he was an
enemy to King and Reb. that is _Respublica_ or Common-wealth.

    The Fleet shall stand before the City,
    Then shall go away for a little while,
    And then shall take a great troop of Citizens on Land,
    Fleet shall come back and recover a great deal.

ANNOT.

It seemeth here he speaketh of two Fleets, one of which shall stand a
little while before a Town, and carry a great many Citizens away, but
that the other Fleet shall come in the mean time, and redeem them.

    Shall be so great through the South and North,
    By his own Sister great forces shall be raised,
    Running away he shall be murdered near the bush of _Ambellon_.

ANNOT.

The question here is, whether this _neuf vieux_ in _French_ or _new old_
in _English_ be the proper name of a man, or be a Metaphor, to express a
young man of an ancient Family, when the Reader hath satisfied himself
upon that, the rest is easie enough.

    Because so much, and so burning shall fall the Snow,
    The Field watered shall come to decay

ANNOT.

All this is nothing but an extraordinary great Snow that shall fall about
_Rhegio_ a City of _Italy_, whereby the Fields shall be drowned and fall
to decay; insomuch, that the chief men, called here _Primate_ shall fall
to poverty.

    The Earth and the Air shall freeze with so much water,
    When they shall come to worship _Thursday_,
    That which shall be never, was so fair,
    From the four parts they shall come to honour him.

ANNOT.

This signifieth an exceeding great frost, which shall happen on a Holy
_Thursday_, where the ground and sky shall be so clear, that men may come
from the four parts (_viz._ of the Earth) without trouble for to worship.

    L’an mil neuf cent nonante neuf, sept mois,
    Du Ciel viendra un grand Roy d’effrayeur,

    English.

    In the year a thousand nine hundred ninety nine, and seven months,
    From Heaven a great terrible King,
    To raise again the great King of _Angoulesme_,
    Before and after, _Mars_ shall Reign luckily.

ANNOT.

He that is called here King of _Angoulesme_ was _Francis_ the I. as
gallant a Prince as ever _France_ had, who before he was King went by the
title of Duke of _Angoulesme_; the rest is easie.

    The time present, together with the past,
    Shall be judged by a great _Jovialiste_,
    The World shall at last be weary of him,
    And he shall be thought unfaithful by the Canon-Law Clergy.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy concerneth meerly _Francis Rabelais_, who was the greatest
_Jovialist_, that is, Merry-man that ever was, and did so lash and
censure the abuses of every profession, and chiefly of the Clergy, that
to this very day he goeth among them for an Atheist, and a Prophaner of
Sacred and Civil things.

    English.

    The year of the great number seven being past,
    Shall be seen at that time the sports of _Hecatombe_,
    Not far from the great age thousand,
    That the Buried shall come out of their Graves.

ANNOT.

_Hecatombe_ signifieth a Sacrifice, wherein a hundred beasts were killed.

The sense therefore is this, that when the year a thousand seven hundred
is past, that such sport of _Hecatombe_ shall be seen again, not far
from the sixth Millenary, when the day shall rise, for it is a common
opinion among the Learned, that as God Created the World in six days, and
rested the seventh, so when the World hath lasted six thousand years, for
a thousand years before God are as one day, there shall be an Eternal
Sabbath and a Resurrection, both of the just and unjust.

    So long expected shall never come
    Into _Europe_, in _Asia_ shall appear,
    One come forth of the line of the great _Hermes_,
    And shall grow above all the Kings in the East.

All is plain, but only this, whether he taketh _Hermes_ as a King of
_Ægypt_, or as the Father of the Hermetick Philosophers.

    The great Senate will decree a Pomp,
    To one who after shall be vanquished and expelled,
    The goods of his partners shall be
    Publickly sold, and the enemy shall be driven away.

ANNOT.

What Senate and particular man he meaneth, is the only difficulty in this.

    English.

    Thirty associated of the Order of _Quirettes_,
    Banished, their goods shall be given to their adversaries,
    All their good deeds shall be imputed to them as crimes,
    The Fleet scattered, they shall fall into the hands of Pyrates.

ANNOT.

I could not find any man or Author that knew what is meant here by
_Quirettes_, which is only the difficulty of this Stanza.

    Sudden joy shall turn into a sudden sadness,
    At _Rome_ to the embraced graces,
    Mourning, cries, weeping, tears, blood, excellent joy,
    Contrary Troops surprized and carryed away.

ANNOT.

There is nothing difficult here, but what he meaneth by _Embraced
graces_, for my part I believe them some new married Couples, who in the
middle of their jollity shall fall into these disasters.

    English.

    The old ways shall be made all fair,
    There shall be a passage to _Memphis_ _Somentrées_,
    The great _Mercury_ of _Hercules_ Flower de luce,
    Making the Earth, the Sea, and the Countreys to quake.

ANNOT.

This word _Somentrees_, being altogether barbarous, is the reason that
neither sense nor construction can be made of all these words.

    By force of Arms the great Brass Gates,
    He shall cause to be open, the King being joyned with the Duke,

    A Treasure put in a Temple by _Hesperian_ Citizens,
    In the same hid in a secret place,
    The hungry bonds shall cause the Temple to be open,
    And take again and ravish, a fearful prey in the middle.

ANNOT.

This is concerning a Treasure hid by _Spaniards_ (called here _Hesperian
Citizens_) in a Church, which the people of a Town being poor, and almost
starved, caused to be open, and did ransack it, but in the middle of it
they found a strange prey, but what it was God knows.

    English.

    Cries, weeping, tears, shall come with daggers,
    With a false seeming they shall give the last assault,
    Set round about they shall plant deep,
    Beaten back alive, and murdered upon a sudden.

ANNOT.

This seemeth to have a relation to the Scalado of _Geneva_, of which you
shall have a full account in the 69 Stanza, of the twelfth Century.


LXXXIII.

    French.

    De batailler ne sera donné signe,
    Du Parc seront contraints de sortir hors,
    De _Gasp_ l’entour sera cogneu l’enseigne,
    Qui fera mettre de tous les siens a mort.

    English.

    There shall no sign of battle be given,
    They shall be compelled to come out of the Park,
    Round about _Gasp_ shall be known the Ensign,
    That shall cause all his own to be put to death.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie was fulfilled in the year 1556. by the Marshal of _Brissac_
in _Piemont_, when he took the Town of _Vignal_ by assault, where 1200.
_Neapolitans_ were put to the Sword, who were called the braves of
_Naples_; because they were all very gallantly habited, and the Governour
being wounded, cast himself desperately into a Well, whence the Marshal
caused him to be taken up, and to be cured of his wounds.

In this conflict _there was no sign of Battle given_; because it was
done by the rashness of a Souldier, Bastard of a Bastard of the house
of _Boissy_, who without expecting the command of the General, went
alone upon the breche, and after he had [Transcriber’s Note: the text
is illegible here with 1-2 words missing] against the Enemies, drew his
Sword, and did fight a great while hand to hand without being wounded.

Some of his Companions seeing his valour, did follow him, and others
came to their help, and these carryed along with them all those that
were appointed to give the assault; insomuch that by a kind of Warlike
emulation, all did carry themselves so valliantly, that after a long and
stout resistance, they routed the Enemies, and put all the Garrisons to
the Sword.

It is what the Author saith in the first and second Verse, seeing that
those that were appointed to give Battle, every one in his Regiment or
Squadron, were compelled by emulation to come out of their _Park_; that
is, from the Precinct of place wherein they were. The third Verse addeth,
that _round about the Ensign of ~Gasp.~ shall be known_; that is, in the
assault the Captain of that place, named _Gaspar Pagan_, was remarked to
fight valliantly every where the _French_ did assault, which the Marshal
of _Brissac_ seeing, as also the forwardness of his men commanded the
general assault to be given. The Captain seeing the Town taken, though
he had above twenty wounds, for marks of his Valour, yet by that despair
threw himself into a Well, near which the Marshal passing, heard his
voice, and caused him to be drawn out, and cured of his wounds.

This Captain being resolved to perish in this assault, _did cause all his
own to be put to death_, as the fourth Verse saith. The History of this
Town was famous, for which the Marshal of _Brissac_ did present Gifts to
the most Valiant, and among the rest to this Bastard, after he had put
him in jeopardy of his life, for having violated the Military Orders in
a matter of such concernment. That Town of _Vignal_ is situated upon a
Mountain of the Countrey of _Montserrat_, of a difficult access, where
no pieces of Ordinance can be brought up, but by the help of Mens Arms;
after the taking of it, the Marshal did cause it to be raised even to
the ground, because it could not be useful to the _French_, that had
many other places to keep, and might have been very beneficial to the
_Spaniard_.


LXXXIV.

    Le Naturel a si haut, haut non bas,
    Le tard retour sera marris contens.
    Le _Recloing_ ne sera sans debats,

    English.

    The Natural to so high, high not low,
    The late return shall make the sad contented,
    The _Recloing_ shall not be without strife,
    In employing and loosing all his time.

ANNOT.

The _Recloing_, being a forged word, without signification, and being the
Key of all this Stanza, no body can tell what to make of it.


LXXXV.

    French.

    Le vieil _Tribun_ au point de la _Trehemide_,
    Sera presse Captif ne delivrer,
    Le vueil non vueil, le mal parlant timide.
    Par legitime a ses amis livrer.

    English.

    The old _Tribun_, at the point of the _Trehemide_,
    Shall be much intreated not to deliver the Captain,
    They will not will, the ill speaking fearful,
    By legitimate shall deliver to his friends.

ANNOT.

The old _Treban_ is an old Captain or Governour of a Town, who shall be
much entreated not to deliver at the end of the _Trehemede_ (that is,
three Months) one that he kept prisoner, but will they or not, he shall
lawfully deliver him to his friends.

    English.

    As a Griffin shall come the King of _Europe_,
    Accompanied with those of the North,
    Of red and white shall conduct a great Troop,
    And they shall go against the King of _Babylon_.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the King of _Swedeland_, _Gustavus Adolphus_, who is
called here the King of _Europe_; because he lived in a part of it, and
because he was one, if not the most gallant Prince of his time, who with
a great Army of his Subjects, named here those of _Aquilon_, invaded
_Germany_, and made War against the Emperour, whom he calleth here the
King of _Babylon_, either because he is a great favourer of the _Roman_
Church, or because the Empire, by reason of so many sovereign Princes in
it is like a _Babel_ and confusion.

_The great Troop of Red and White_, were his own Souldiers, whom he
distinguished by their several habits. Clothing them with several
Colours, to breed an emulation among them, there being the Red Regiment,
the White, the Blew, the Yellow, the Green, _&c._

    A great King shall land by _Nice_,
    The great Empire of death shall interpose with it.
    He shall put his Mare in the _Antipodes_,
    By Sea all the Pillage shall vanish.

ANNOT.

A great King shall land hard by _Nice_, which is a Sea Town in _Savoy_,
but he shall have a great loss of his men by death, and the Sea shall
swallow all his plunder.

    English.

    Foot and Horse upon the second Watch,
    Shall come in destroying all by Sea,
    They shall come into the Harbour of _Marseilles_,
    Tears, cryes and blood, never was so bitter a time.

This is so clear that it needeth no interpretation.

    The Walls shall be turned from Brick into Marble,
    There shall be peace for seven and fifty years,
    Joy to mankind, the Aqueduct shall be built again,
    Health, abundance of fruit, joy and mellifluous time.

    English.

    The inhumane tyrant shall die a hundred times,
    In his place shall be put a Learned and mild man,
    All the Senate shall be at his command,
    He shall be made angry by a rash malicious person.

ANNOT.

This Prognostication is easie to be understood, only it is indeterminate,
and specifieth neither time nor persons.


XCI.

    Clergé _Romain_ l’an mil six cens & neuf,

    English.

    The _Roman_ Clergy in the year a thousand six hundred and nine,
    In the beginning of the year shall make choice
    Of a gray and black, come out of the Countrey,
    Such a one as never a worse was.

ANNOT.

Wanting the Chronology of the Popes, I have not set down who that Pope
was, then whom our Author saith there never was a worse, but the time
being so punctually prefixed, it will be an easie matter for the Reader
to find out satisfaction in this point.

    Devant le Pere l’Enfant sera tué,
    Le Pere apres entre cordes de jonc,
    _Genevois_ peuple sera esvertué,
    Gisant le Chef au milieu comme un tronc.

    English.

    The Child shall be killed before the Fathers eyes,
    The Father after shall enter into ropes of rushes,
    The people of _Geneva_ shall notably stir themselves,
    The Chief lying in the middle like a log.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is twofold, the two first Verses foretel of a man that
shall have his Son killed before his eyes, and himself afterward shall be
strangled by a rope made of Rushes.

The two last Verses are concerning the people of _Geneva_, who (as he
saith) shall lustily bestir themselves, while their Captain, Chief, or
Commander shall carelesly lie like a log.


XCIII.

    French.

    La Barque neuve recevra les Voiages,
    La & aupres transfereront l’Empire,
    _Beaucaire_, _Arles_, retiendront les Hostages,
    Pres deux Colomnes trouvées de _Porphyre_.

    English.

    The new Ship shall make journeys
    Into the place, and thereby where they shall translate the Empire,
    _Beaucaire_, _Arles_, shall keep the Hostages,
    Near them shall be found two Columns of _Porphyry_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning three things, the first is of a considerable
new Ship, that shall sail several times into a place where the Empire
shall be translated.

The second is concerning two Towns of _Languedoc_, _Beaucaire_, and
_Arles_, who shall not surrender the Hostages that they had.

The third is concerning two Columns of _Porphiry_ that shall be found
there about.


XCIV.

    French.

    English.

    From _Nismes_, d’_Arles_ and _Vienna_ contempt,
    They shall not obey the _Spanish_ Proclamation,
    To the _Labouriez_ for to condemn the great one,
    Six escaped in a _Seraphical_ habit.

ANNOT.

It seemeth that those three aforenamed Towns will refuse to obey a
_Spanish_ Proclamation, that would compel them to condemn a great man; as
for _Labouriez_ it is a barbarous and non-sensical word.

The last Verse signifieth, that six shall escape, cloathed in
_Franciscan_ habits, called here _Seraphical_, because the Franciscans
believe that a _Seraphin_ did appear to St. _Francis_ their Patron, from
whence their Order is called by many the _Seraphical_ Order.

    Dans les _Espagnes_ viendra Roy trespuissant,

    English.

    A most potent King shall come into _Spain_,
    Who by Sea and Land shall make great Conquests towards the South,
    This evil shall beat down the horns of the new Moon,
    And slack the Wings of those of _Friday_.

ANNOT.

_A great and potent King shall come out of ~Spain~, who by Sea and Land
shall make great Conquest towards the South_, that is _Barbary_, which
shall be a great prejudice to the _Turkish_ Empire, who hath for his Arms
a new Moon; _And slack the wings of those of ~Friday~_, that is, of the
Turks, because they keep the _Friday_ for their _Sabbath_. This Prophecy
was fulfilled by _Philip_ the II. King of _Spain_, who drove away all the
_Moores_ out of the South part of it, and took a great many places in the
Coasts of _Barbary_.

    English.

    _Triremes_ full of Captives of all Age.
    Time good for evil, the sweet for bitter,
    Pray to the _Barbarian_, they shall be too hasty,
    Desirous to see the feather complain in the wind.

ANNOT.

Triremes are Galleys with three benches of Oares, the rest is much of the
nature of the former.


XCVIII.

    The clear splendour of the merry Maid,
    Shall shine no more, she shall be a great while without Salt,
    With Merchants, Ruffans, Wolves, odious,

This is concerning a famous beauty, who in her latter age shall
prostitute her self to all comers.

    Fearful Doe, shall be with the Mastiffs,
    The sweet Manna shall no more fall to them,
    There shall be no more watching and keeping of Mastiffs.

ANNOT.

This is a Prognostication of a general peace all _Europe_ over.

_The sweet Manna shall no more fall to them_, signifieth that the
_Europeans_ shall be fed no more with Manna, as the Jews were in the
Desert, but shall pass to the Land of Promise, that is of peace and
quietness.

    The great Empire shall be in _England_,
    The _Pempotan_ for more then three hundred years,
    Great Armies shall pass through Sea and Land,
    The _Portugueses_ shall not be contented therewith.

ANNOT.

This is a favourable one for _England_, for by it the Empire, or the
greatest Dominion of _Europe_ is promised to it, for the space of above
three hundred years, at which the _Portugueses_ or _Spaniards_ shall much
repine.

    Plague and new attempt shall trouble them enclosed,
    The fury of it shall bite in _Aix_ and the places there about,
    Then they of _Phocens_ shall come and double their misery.

ANNOT.

These are names of particular persons that are here threatned of the
Plague, as also the City of _Aix_ Capital of _Provence_, and the Countrey
about it, and after that the City of _Marseilles_ named here _Phocens_,
because they are a Colony of the old _Phocenses_ in _Greece_.

    English.

    By _Ville Franche_, _Mascon_ shall be put in disorder,
    In the Faggots shall Souldiers be hidden,
    The time shall change in prime for the King,
    By _Chalon_ and _Moulins_ they shall be all hewed to pieces.

ANNOT.

_Ville Franche_ is a Town five Leagues from _Lion_; and _Mascon_ another
about the same distance from _Ville Franche_, and _Chalon_ from _Mascon_,
and _Moulins_ from _Chalon_.

The meaning of it is this, that there shall be an attempt from _Ville
Franche_ upon _Mascon_, by Souldiers hidden in Faggots, that shall be
cut off by the succours of those _Chalons_ and _Moulins_; which like
did happen in the time of the Civil Wars in _France_, between the King
and the League, when the Towns stood one against another, but because I
can find nothing of it in the History, I suspend my further judgement
therein.

    Shall cause to fail, brusing hard, to move Faith,
    Son of God! all _Provence_ swallowed up?
    Driven from the Kingdom, raging mad without spitting.

ANNOT.

The curiosity of the Author in striving to begin all his words, in the
two first Verses hath made the tense of this Stanza so obscure, that I
believe no body ever did or shall truely understand it, all what can be
gathered out of it, is great threatning of several calamities, that were
to happen upon _Provence_ his native Countrey, as it did a little while
after his death, by the Civil Wars for Religion.

    Assault farouche en _Cypre_ se prepare,
    La larme a l’œil de ta ruine proche,
    _Bizance_ Classe _Morisque_ si grand tare,
    Deux differens le grand vast par la Roche.

    English.

    A cruel assault is preparing in _Cyprus_,
    Tears in my eye, thou art near thy ruine,
    The Fleet of _Constantinople_ and the _Morick_ so great damage.
    Two differents the great wast shall be by the Rock.

ANNOT.

_A cruel assault is preparing_, signifies the shortness of the time in
which it was to happen, for our Author Prophecied 1555. and _Cyprus_ was
taken by the _Turks_ in the Month of _August_ 1571. _Selymus_ the II.
fifth Emperour of the _Turks_, where the perfidiousness of the Bassa
_Mustapha_ that Besieged it is remarkable, for having the Town delivered
him upon Articles; First, that the Inhabitants of the City yet alive
should enjoy their lives, liberty, and goods, with free exercise of
Christian Religion, that the Governour _Bragadinus_ with the rest of the
Captains and Souldiers might in safty depart with Bag and Baggage, and
at their departure take with them five pieces of Ordinance, and three
Horses, which soever it should please them to make choise of, and that
the _Turks_ should safely conduct them into _Crete_, finding them both
Victual and Shipping; yet all these matters agreed upon, and commenced
into Writting, as also by solemn Oaths on both side confirmed; the
perfidious Bassa nevertheless caused _Bragadinus_ to have his Ears cut
off, then caused him to be set in a Chair, and his skin to be flain off
from him quick, his head to be cut from his dead body, and upon the point
of a Spear to be set upon a high place, his skin also stuffed with Chaff,
he caused to be hanged up at the Yards Arm, and so to be carried about.

    Deux corps un chef, champs divisez en deux,
    Et puis respondre a quattre non ouys,
    Petits pour grands a pertius mal pour eux,
    Tour d’_Aigues_ foudre, pire pour _Eussovis_.

    English.

    Two bodies, one head, fields divided into two,
    And then answer to four unheard ones,
    Small for great ones, open evil for them,
    The Tower of _Aigues_ beaten by Lightning, worse for _Eussovis_.

ANNOT.

Out of this crabbid Stanza we shall pick what we can, and leave the rest
to the judgment of the judicious Reader. First,

_The two bodies, one head_ may be understood either a Monster that was
so, as it did happen once in _Italy_, as _Pareus_ witnesseth; or of the
union of the two Kingdoms of _France_ and _Navarre_, under _Henry_ the
IV. or of _England_ and _Scotland_ under King _James_.

The Tower of _Aiguemortes_ was strucken with the Lightning, a while after
our Author had put out his Prophecies.

    English.

    Sad Councels, unfaithful, malicious,
    Ill advice the Law shall be betrayed,
    The people shall be moved, wild & quarrelsome,
    Both in Countrey and City the peace shall be hated.

ANNOT.

This is plain.

    French.

    Roy contre Roy, & le Duc contre Prince,
    Haine entre iceux dissension, horrible,
    Rage & fureur sera toute Province,

    English.

    King against King, and Duke against a Prince,
    Hatred between them, horrid dissension,
    Rage and fury shall be in every Province,
    Great War in _France_, and horrid changes.

ANNOT.

This is a true picture of the miseries of the Civil Wars in _France_,
when _Charles_ the IX. King of _France_, was against _Henry_ King of
_Navarre_, and the Duke of _Guise_ against the Prince of _Condé_.


VII.

    French.

    L’accord & pache sera du tout rompue,

    L’haine euvieille, toute foy corrompue,
    Et l’esperance, _Marseilles_ sans concorde.

    English.

    The agreement and contract shall be broken in pieces,
    The friendships polluted by discord,
    The hatred shall be old, all faith corrupted,
    And hope also, _Marseilles_ without concord.

ANNOT.

This is a second part of the foregoing.


VIII.

    French.

    Guerre & debats, a _Blois_ guerre & tumulte,
    Divers aguets, adveux inopinables,
    Entrer dedans _Chasteau Trompette_, insulte,
    _Chasteau du Ha_ qui en seront coulpables.

    English.

    War and strifes, at _Blois_ war and tumult,
    Several lying in wait, acknowledgment unexpected,
    They shall get into the _Chasteau Trompette_ by assault,
    And into the _Chasteau du Ha_, who shall be guilty of it.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning the Civil Wars of _France_ between the King
and the League.

He saith, _at ~Blois~ war and tumult_; because the Duke of _Guise_,
and the Cardinal his Brother were both killed there, at the convention
of Estates by the Kings command, which he calleth here _acknowledgment
unexpected_, because the Kingdom did own the fact.

The last two Verses are concerning the two Castles or Fortresses of
_Bourdeaux_, who in those days were sometimes by one party, and sometimes
by another.


LXV.

    French.

    A tenir fort par fureur contraindra,
    Tout cœur trembler, _Langon_ advent terrible,
    Le coup de pied mille pieds te rendra,
    _Girond._ _Garon._ ne furent plus horribles.

    English.

    He shall by fury compel them to hold out,
    Every heart shall tremble, _Langon_ shall have a terrible event,
    The kick shall return to thee a thousand kicks,
    _Girond._ _Garon._ are no more horrid.

ANNOT.

The two last Verses seem to have a relation to the foregoing Stanza,
and to import, that the Governour of _Bourdeaux_ shall compel them to
hold out, and because _Langon_, a Town 20 or 30 Miles distant from
_Bourdeaux_, was of the contrary party, and did annoy sometimes those of
_Bourdeaux_, it is threatned here to have a thousand kicks for one.

_Gironde_ and _Garonne_ are the two Rivers of _Bourdeaux_.

    _Eiovas_ proche, esloigner Lac _Leman_,

    Loin des _Nepueux_, du feu grand _Supelman_,
    Tous de leur suyte.

    English.

    _Eiovas_ near, yet seemeth to be far from the Lake _Leman_,
    Very great preparatives, return confusion,
    Far from the _Neveux_ of the late great _Supelman_,
    All of their train.

ANNOT.

This is a notable one, directly foretelling the Enterprise or Scalado
made by the Duke of _Savoy_, upon _Geneva_: for the better Intelligence
of which, we shall first give the sense word for word, and then set down
the whole History as a piece of Cabinet, that the Reader after so much
tedious and crabbid reading, may have some field to spatiate and recruit
it self.

_Eiovas near_, _Eiovas_ by Anagram is _Savoy_, or the Duke of it, who at
that time was near _Geneva_; _yet seemeth far from the Lake ~Leman~_,
which is the Lake that passeth through _Geneva_, called in Latine _Lacus
Lemannus_. _Very great preparatives_; because at that time he made
great preparations to Scale the Walls of _Geneva_. _Return_; because
he was forced to retire. _Confusion_; because he was confounded in his
undertaking. _Far from the ~Neveux~ of the great ~Supelman~_; that is,
an action much unworthy the Kindred of _Henry_ the IV. called here great
_Supelman_, to whom he was Allied. _All of their Train_; that is, all
that were with him in that undertaking, did partake of his return and
confusion. Now the History is thus.

About the latter end of the year 1600. the Duke of _Savoy_ having done
before all his endeavours to take the City of _Geneva_ by force, did
resolve at last to have it by craft, and stratagem. He did frame a design
full of Courage, Understanding, and Conduct, as well as of misfortune;
it was long a hatching without being discovered, and although it was
known that he caused Ladders to be made, and that he bought every where
men of courage and resolution, and had a great number of them already at
_Chambery_, well payed and maintained, waiting for the ripeness of the
design, though Ignorant of it. No body could believe that it was against
those of _Geneva_; because at that time he did treat with them of the
manner of living friendly, and of the liberty of Trade, having sent to
them for this purpose a few days before the President _Rochette_, to
treat and advise of a manner of living friendly together, for the ease
of the people. They did so much hearten and relish his propositions
and promises, that although Cities of such condition, do not lightly
believe them that have been their Enemies, nevertheless they trusted
to that, and grew careless of their own preservation, thinking that
there was nothing more powerfull for their security than the treaties
of peace between _France_, _Spain_, and _Savoy_, in which they thought
themselves included, under the name of the confederate with the Cantons
of _Switzerland_; insomuch that the Dukes subjects went thither so
familiarly, that the day before this Execution some Gentlemen that knew
something of the design, being come into the Town to buy some Horses,
said they would come again the next day to conclude the Bargain, and
others had kept she same Language for other Wares, so fully perswaded
were they of a success, though Heaven, who laugheth at the thoughts of
the proud, had resolved to humble and abase them.

The Governour of _Lion_ had presently notice that the Duke of _Savoy_
was coming on the side of the Mountain, and carryed with him scaling
Ladders, of which he sent notice to the King, and provided what was
necessary for the defence of _Lion_, although the same Advice said it
was not for _France_; yet all this could not hinder the Execution which
was in the mean time a doing. D’_Albigny_ Lieutenant General of the Duke
in those Countreys he had on this side of the Mountains, had made the
Troops to pass, and for that purpose had assigned them of their Quarters
in the Towns of _Geneva_, in several places, that they might not be
so soon discovered. The Randezvous was at a place called _Chambery_,
the time of the Execution was reserved to the prudence of the Leader.
The time was not according to the precept of the _Parthians_, who ever
fought by night, nor of the _Lacedemonians_, who undertook nothing but
in the time of the full Moon; for it was one of the darkest and longest
nights of all the year, the Troops began their March about six of the
Clock. _Brignoles_ Governour of _Bonnes_, a small Town in _Fossigny_,
distant three Leagues from _Geneva_, was the man that had contributed
most of his own for the performance of this design, whom he thought so
certain, that he said he would die to the world, if he did not live in
_Geneva_. D’_Albigny_ had set up Watches upon all the passes, to stop all
Travellers, for fear notice should be given of their coming; and of that
of the Duke of _Savoy_, to whom the Execution had been represented so
sure and certain, in that he should be there himself to reap the Honour
and profit of it, and to end the Triumph that his Grandfather had begun.
He came over the Mountains with five Gentlemen only in his Company, and
the same day came to _Tremblures_, a Village distant from _Geneva_ about
three Miles; and for all that they could not hinder, but an unknown
Trooper did ride as far as the New-gate, and asked to speak to him that
commanded there, bidding him look to themselves, because the duke of
_Savoy_, wished them no good, and so retreated galloping. This News was
brought to _Blondel_, the fourth Syndic of the Town, and who had the
charge of the Guard that year; he answerd, he would provide for that.
Another came afterwards, and told him that the Dukes Forces were about
the Town, but knew not upon what design, and that himself was at _Bonne_;
he answered, that they were not Birds, and could not fly. Mistrust is
not always be commended; but too much confidence in such business, is
exceedingly dangerous.

Those that were to do the Execution, and to get up first upon the
Ladders, went along by the River of _Albe_, that the noise of the
Waters might hinder the Sentinals to hear them. Two things did happen,
that were an ill Omen for them, they saw in the Skies unusual fires,
a Hare did many times cross their way, and gave them a false Alarm,
and as many things being considered in the night time, do trouble the
imagination, and that fear maketh one think that Bushes are Squadrons,
and Thistles Pikes, as it did happen once at the Siege of _Paris_ by the
_Burgundians_. They did discover about Eleven of the Clock some Posts, to
whom the Cloth-workers of _Geneva_ use to nail their Stuffs to dry them.
Those that went formost would have Charged them, thinking they had been
an Ambuscado; from thence they went all along the _Rhosne_ to the Meadow
of _Plain Palais_. _Brignolet_, and those that were ordained for the
Scalado followed d’_Albigny_, who led them down into the Town-Ditch, on
the side of the _Corraterie_, without being discovered by the Sentinals,
although the Ducks that were in the Ditch, did (for to awake those of
_Geneva_) what the Geese did at _Rome_ against the _French_. They went
over the Ditch upon Hurdles for fear to sink in the Mire, and did set
up three Ladders of a wonderful invention; because they could be easily
carryed upon Mules, and they could be folded into so many pieces, that
they could reach the highest wall that is; and besides that, so strong
and firm, that no Ladder of one piece could be more; they had besides
that provided Hatchets, Hammers, Pincers, and other such Tools, to cut
Iron Chains, break Locks, draw Nails and Bars, they had besides several
Petardoes and Petardo-Masters. Fortune, who hath a great power in such
undertakings, did fail them in their need, after she had brought them to
the middle of the City, and made them masters of the streets for above
two hours.

By one of those Ladders went up about two hundred men, _Brignolet_ was
the first, followed by d’_Attignac_ and _Sonas_, and did carry himself
more valliantly and prudently; having got over the Wall, he surprized
the Sentinal, and drew from him the Watch-word, and his Life, then
threw him over into the Ditch, and stood in his place to stay for the
Round, that he might do as much to him, as he did when it came near him
to give him the Watch-word. D’_Albigny_, and one Father _Alexander_ a
_Scotchman_, and a Jesuite, were at the Ladders foot, incouraging those
that went up. The Boy that carryed the Lanthorn saved himself, and gave
notice to the _Court de Garde_ of what had befallen his Master, at which
the _Court de Garde_ was not much moved. This was a doing between One
and Two of the Clock, expecting that of four, at the which they had
proposed to make their greater attempt, and in the mean while to give
time to the succour to draw near, and to the day to break, because all
Warlike Executions done by night, carry always some confusion with
them. No body had gone to bed in the Town with a thought to be awakened
so soon, they rested upon the assurance of the Peace. The undertakers
had a whole hours time to get up, and as much before they met with any
opposition. If d’_Albigny_ had been Within to husband that time better
than did _Sonas_, _Brignolet_, and d’_Attignac_, they might have cried,
the Town is won. About half an hour past two of the Clock, a Sentinal
that was in the Mints Tower, having heard some noise in the Ditch, shot
off his Gun to give the Alarm, which compelled _Brignolet_ to discover
himself, charging all that was in the _Court de Garde_ of the New-gate,
that he might Plant the Petard, and make way for the main Body that was
in _Plain Palais_. They got very well the _Court de Garde_, but against
the Rule of War, which commandeth to kill all, they let one escape
that had so much wit as to get up, and to let down the Port-Cullis, to
frustrate the effect of the Petard. The Town was at that time full of
Cries and horrid Houlings, of which the _Savoiards_ should have made
their profit, and increased their courage, as it did weaken that of the
Townsmen, that knew not where to run, some crying one way, some another.
The undertakers lost themselves in the appearance of so happy a success,
those that were without should have given the Alarm at some other Gate,
to divide the Forces of the Town, those that were within made no use
of their Hatchets, Hammers and Pincers, they forgot to set some Houses
on fire; the spirit of astonishment seized upon them, having in their
thoughts the Sack and Plunder of the Town, more than the perfection of
their Conquest; they made only use of a certain croaking like Frogs,
as the _Turks_ use the _Bret, Bret_, to animate and rally themselves.
_Brignolet_ being compelled to discover himself, marched towards the New
Gate, distant from that place about 200. Paces, and there was wounded,
and died a little after; the Fight began in the dark, and the _Court de
Garde_ was dispersed, one Souldier hearing them call for the Petard, got
upon the Gate, and cut the Rope that held the Port-Culis, and shut up
the Petard between the Port-Culis, and the Gate which they went about
to break open, with their Hatchets and Hammers, at the first resistance
the Petards Master was killed. The Order is such at _Geneva_, that in
all extraordinary accidents, every Citizen knoweth the place of his
Randezvous, and there goeth with his Arms, and the Town House is never
destitute of Souldiers.

In the mean time the Magistrate cryeth, He that loveth me let him follow
me. Some Countrey Fellows of the Neighbouring Towns, who kept their
watch by turns, being led by some Captains and Citizens, did present
themselves at the New Gate, where they were stoutly received, and beaten
back, and yet the first shot of theirs killed the Petard-Master, who was
much troubled with his Tools. This first Charge would not have driven
them back, if the body of the Citizens had not come, and Charged them so
furiously, that they lost all their Courage; Necessity which strengthens
even those that want Courage, did so animate the Citizens to their
defence, that the undertakers were fained to give back. The more nimble
went again to their Ladders, which proved useless; because the Canon that
was Planted in the Fort of _Loye_, near the Ditch, had broken them; so
that they left four and fifty dead upon the place, and upon the Curtain
of the _Corraterie_, and thirteen that were taken alive. If the Town had
had Souldiers in readiness to make a Sally in that Andabatism, the night
being sometimes favourable to such expeditions, those that were at _Plain
Palais_, would not have retreated in so good an Order.

There were thirteen taken alive, among whom were the Baron of _Attignac_,
the Lord _Sonas_, the Lord _Chaffardon_, upon promise of their Lives, and
to be Prisoners of War, or else they had preserved an Honourable death to
all the promises, to be spared in laying down their Arms; among them was
d’_Attignac_, who fought valiantly, and gave his order of St. _Maurice_
to his man, bidding him save himself, being resolved to die with his
Sword in his hand.

The Lords of _Geneva_ would not use them as Prisoners of War; but as
Thieves and Robbers come into the City over the Walls. They said that the
Duke was too generous a Prince for so wicked and perfidious an action:
there was several Opinions concerning their Sentence of Death, the more
moderate would have them be put to Ransom, others would have them be
kept Prisoners, that they might serve for exchange, if some of the Town
were taken in the continuation of the War; but the more violent did
stir the people, in representing unto them the loss of their Religion,
the ravishing of their Wives and Maids, the Massacre, the Sack and
Plunder of the Town, and their perpetual slavery, and the complaints
of the Widows and Children of those that had been killed, were so much
considered, that the more moderate Opinions did not appear injust, but in
how much they tended to Death. They were Condemned to be Hanged, which
is thought the most Ignominious Death: they desired to have their Heads
cut off as Gentlemen, which was granted, but it was after they were
Hanged. Fifty nine were found killed and wounded, who had all their Heads
cut off. In the Ditch there were some Arms found, thirty dead, and four
wounded, all their Heads were cut off, and set with the rest upon the
Gallows. Of the Citizens of the Town there were seventeen found dead,
most of them killed by their Companions in the dark. Their Names were
_John Canal_, one of the Lords of the Councel, _Lewis Baudiere_, _John
Vandel_, _Lewis Galatin_, _Peter Cabriol_, _Mark Cambiagua_, _Nicolas
Baugueret_, _James Mercier_, _Abraham de Baptista_, _Daniel Humbert_,
_Martin de Bolo_, _Michael Monard_, _Philip Potter_, _Francis Bouzesel_,
_John Buignet_, _James Petit_, _Gerrard Muzy_, and about twenty wounded.
The Sunday after Dinner, about two of the Clock, 67 Heads, as well of
those that were killed, as of those that were Hanged, were fastened upon
the Gallows, and the Bodies thrown into the _Rhosne_. The next _Tuesday_
there was a solemn Fasting day kept, and they began to publish every
where the wonders of this Deliverance.

Here followeth the Copy of their Letter, to the Governour of _Lion_.

My Lord,

_You have known before this by many of your Letters, how his Highness
of ~Savoy~, notwithstanding he knew, and had confessed that we were
included in the Peace made in the year 1600. between his Royal Majesty
of ~France~, and him; hath nevertheless divers times oppressed us,
by detaining our Rents, prohibiting of Trade, other violences and
extortions, refusing to hearken to the just and pressing remonstrances,
which his Majesty hath made him several times in our behalf; but hath
also contrived many designs to surprise us in time of Peace. Now it
is so, that for the encompassing his pernicious design, the Lord
~d’Albigny~, ~Saturday~ last, the Eleventh of this Month, did bring
before our Town, on the side of ~Plain Palais~, about two Thousand men,
Horse and Foot, all choice men, and hath caused to pass about 200. of
them over our Ditch, by the ~Corraterie~, and having set up Ladders one
within another, hath caused them to come into our Town, about three
of the Clock in the Morning, upon ~Sunday~ the Twelfth of this Month,
encouraging them himself, being in the Ditch; so that being come down
into the Town, some went towards our New Gate to force it open, and give
entrance to their Companions, who were in the plain of ~Plain Palais~,
others went towards the Mint Gate, that they might by this means come
into the middle of the Town. But it hath pleased God to look upon us with
his favourable Eye, and to give such a Heart to the Citizens, that they
beat them back, and killed the best part of them taken upon the place,
the rest hath been taken, and since that Hanged by our Order, the rest
threw themselves down from the wall; so that we hear, many of them are
either dead or grievously wounded. It is a wonderfull deliverance of our
God, for which we are particularly bound to Praise him. But as it is
probable, that the said Lord ~d’Albigny~ will continue his ill designs,
by so much the more that we hear his Highness is not far from us, we do
intreat and request by all our affection, that you would be pleased to
consider what prejudice the taking of this place would be to his Majesty,
and to continue us your favour, and assist us with your wise and prudent
advise, ~&c.~_

_Many did judge of the success of this enterprise by the beginning,
and were more forward to write, than to perform well. The King had
notice that the Duke was Master of the Town, and the manner of doing
was represented with so much felicity and facility, that there was less
reason to doubt of it, than believe it. The Truth was not known, but by
the advise of the Governour of ~Lion~, which came before any discourse
that the Town did publish after its deliverance_:

_The Duke went Post back again over the Mountains, and left his Troops
within three miles of ~Geneva~ in three places, at ~Tournon~, ~Fossigny~,
and ~Ternier~, he caused his Embassadours to say to the Lord of ~Berne~,
that he had not made that enterprise to trouble the Peace of the Cantons;
but to prevent ~l’Esdiguieres~ to seize upon it for the King of of
~France~, who should have been so powerfull a Neighbour, as would have
given them great occasion of fears and jealousies_.

_The success of this undertaking made it appear, that God will not have
those Treaties to the assurance of which his name hath been called for
a Witness, to be violated, whatsoever appearance or pretext of Religion
there be._

_Thus Gentle Reader thou seest by all these Circumstances the Truth of
our Authors Prognostication._

This hath a perfect relation to the miseries that followed the general
Massacre of the Protestants in _France_ in the year 1572. when the Rivers
were a stop to the cruelty of the Persecutors, and when so many Houses,
Mannors and Palaces belonging to those of the reformed Religion were
demolished, and to signifie the certainty thereof, he saith in the third
Verse, _take this as an Oracle_.




To the Curious

READER


Gentle Reader,

_Thou shalt take notice, that in this place the covetousness of
Booksellers and Printers, hath in the modern Copies vented new
Prophecies, which they call Prognostications, drawn out of those of
~Michael Nostradamus~, which are so absurd and nonsensical, that they
have been rejected, both by his Son, and the best Wits of this age;
therefore I would not soil the Paper with them, for fear to put such a
course List upon so fine a Cloth, but shall proceed on to give you the
rest of those Prophecies, which truly and undoubtedly belong to our
Author._




Wonderful Prognostications for the Age 1600.

To the King.

Sir,

_Having some years ago recovered certain Prophecies, or Prognostications,
made by the lately Deceased ~Michael Nostradamus~, from the hands of
~Henry Nostradamus~ his Nephew, which he gave me before his death, and
which I have kept secret till now, that I saw they treated of the affairs
of your Estate, and particularly of your Person and Successors, as your
self may see if you please to take the pains to look upon, and wherein
you shall find things worthy of admiration. I have taken the boldness
(though unworthy) to present them to you, transcribed in this little
Book, no less wonderful then the other two which he made, for in it he
hath treated of what shall happen in this Age 1600. not so obscurely as
he hath done formerly but by ~ænigmes~, specifying so clearly the things
he speaketh of, that one may certainly judge of them, as of things that
are already come to pass. Being therefore desirous that your Majesty
should have the first notice thereof, I thought to discharge my duty in
this as one of your most obedient and faithful Subjects, which I intreat
your Majesty would be pleased to agree, obliging so not onely the body of
one of your faithful Subjects already yours, but also the Soul who shall
continue to pray for the health and prosperity of your Majesty, and of
all those that have relation to it, as one that is, and shall ever be_,

    SIR,

        Your most humble, most obedient and faithful Servant and Subject,

                                                                     SEVE.

_A Markdom put into a Boat_, was the Markdom of _Saluces_ in _Italy_,
which the Duke of _Savoy_ had surrepticiously taken from the Crown of
_France_, in the time of the Civil Wars, and would not restore it, for
which there was great Wars between the King of _France_ and the Duke of
_Savoy_, till at last they agreed that the Duke of _Savoy_ should give
in exchange of it the Countrey of _Brescia_; and this is the sense of the
second, third, and half the fourth Verse.

_Galley of ~Florence~ in the Port of ~Marseilles~, a Maid in ~France~_,
signifieth the arrival of _Mary_ of _Medicis_ in the Galleys of _France_,
and her Landing in the Port of _Marseilles_.

_Of the Fort ~Catherine~ the head shall be demolished_; the Duke of
_Savoy_ to plague and bridle those of _Geneva_, upon whom he hath had
always pretentions, had built a strong Fort two leagues from _Geneva_,
called the Fort St _Catherine_, which did so annoy the Town, that they
made their addresses to _Henry_ the IV. who was then in War with the Duke
of _Savoy_, representing to him that they were not able to relieve his
Army with Victuals, because of the said Fort, whereupon _Henry_ the IV.
took it, and demolished it to the ground.

    Que d’or, d’argent sera de pendre,
    Quand Comte voudra Ville prendre,
    Tant de mille & mille Soldats,
    Tuez, noiez, sans y rien faire,
    Dans plus forte mettra pied terre,

    English.

    How much Gold and Silver shall be spent,
    When Earl shall go about to take a Town,
    So many thousands and thousands of Soldiers,

    In a stronger he shall put his foot on ground,
    A Pygmie helped by the _Censuarts_.

ANNOT.

This Stanza and the next are concerning the Town of _Ostend_, which was
Besieged by the Arch-duke, and defended by the States of _Holland_, under
the conduct of Earl _Maurice_ of _Nassaw_.

_In a stronger he shall put his foot on ground_, signifieth that Earl
_Maurice_ during the said Siege, took the _Sluys_ another Town of the
_Spaniards_, thought stronger then _Ostend_. _A Pygmie helped by the_
Censuarts, signifieth that Prince _Maurice_ whom he calleth here a
_Pygmie_ in comparison of the Arch-duke, was helped by the _French_
and _English_, whom he calleth here _Censuarts_, to rime with the word
Soldats in the foregoing Verse.

    Of Canons, and Forts under ground,
    Shall hold five years, all shall be returned,
    And surrendred to the enemies,
    Water after that shall make War against them.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is as well as the former concerning the Town of _Ostend_,
which after three years Siege instead of five (which is falsly printed
here) was surrendred to the Arch-Duke, and presently after like to be
drowned by the Sea.

    To maintain the happy blood of _Bourbon_.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy was concerning _Lewis_ the XIII. King of _France_, son of
_Henry_ the IV. who was born under the Sign of _Libra_, and therefore
called the _Just_; the rest is easie.

of that Government, and the Prince being busie in the Wars of the
_Netherlands_, the said Governour plaid _Rex_ in his absence, so that the
Prince was forced to have him made away privately.

    Post overtaken in the Countrey,
    And the Scrivener shall cast himself into the Water.

ANNOT.

Two notable Histories are contained in this Stanza, the first is of the
Marshal of _Biron_; the second is of _Nicolas_, High Secretary to the
Lord _Villeroy_, who himself was chief Secretary of State to _Henry_ the
IV. and because they are curious ones, and not to be met every where, we
shall set them down:

The first four Verses are concerning the Duke of _Biron_, who by
transposition of letters is called here _Robin_; this man by his Military
Valour and experience, had from a private Gentleman ascended to the
highest degrees of honour and preferment, that his condition was capable
of, for though he were not forty years old, he had attained unto the
greatest dignities of the Kingdom; being fourteen years old, he was made
Colonel of the _Switzers_ in _Flanders_; a little while after he was made
Marshal of Camp, and after Marshal General: he was admitted Admiral of
_France_ in the Parliament of _Tours_, and then Mareshal of _France_ in
that of _Paris_; at the Siege of _Amiens_ he was sole Lieutenant of his
Majesty, though there were many Princes of the Blood in the Army, and to
compleat his greatness, he was made Peer of _France_, and the Barony of
_Biron_ erected into a Dukedom, not contented with all that, he said,
he would not go to the retaking of the rest of the Towns in _Picardy_,
unless his Statue were erected in Brass before the _Louvre_; and in
conclusion, that he had rather die upon a Scaffold, undertaking some
great matters, then to live idle in his own House, and always among these
Bravadoes, he did mix some bold and dangerous words, which he would have
every body to approve of.

When he saw that after the Siege of _Amiens_ the War was at an end, that
_Britany_ was reduced, and that all the Swords were sheathed for a good
while, he thought that having no more occasion to exercise his valour, he
should grow out of credit, and that he should have no more that power,
by which he plaised the King and do without fear all what he did without
Justice. The fire of that great courage finding no work without, began to
work within, that burning desire of being always the first, did fill his
head with flames and smoak of a great design, he complained of the King,
and of the unequal reward of his deserts and services, did publish his
discontents, adding threatnings to his complaints, and spoke of the King
with little respect, that his most intimate friends did judge his words
insolent and dangerous.

It is true it was the vice of his nature, but there were also some of
Fortune, for finding himself filled with all the prosperities, that a
moderate man might wish for in his condition, he found that men loose
themselves by too much happiness. He began then to lend his Ears unto
flatterers, and when they told him that he was the greatest Captain in
_France_, he answered that he would die upon a scaffold, or he would go
beyond the condition of a single Gentleman, that the goodness of his
sword should give him what Fortune had denied; and the Astrologers to
whom he gave great credit, had foretold him in ambiguous terms, that
nothing could hinder him from being a Sovereign, but the blow of a sword
given by a _Burgundian_, and though all his life time he had shewed but
little Devotion and Zeal to Religion, yet from that time that he prepared
his soul to the motion of his ambition, he fained himself very devout and
zealous, and began to wear Beads, that the Baron of _Lux_ had given him
in a Tennis-Court, and to declare himself an irreconcilsable enemy to the
Protestants, seeking every where some discontented Spirits, whom he did
encourage with the hopes of a profitable change.

_La Nocle_ Lord of _la Fin_ was then for the troubles of _Provence_, and
for the quarrel he had with l’_Esdigvieres_, retired into his House,
threatened of ill usage by the King, enemy to some great ones, loaded
with debts and Sutes in Law. The discontented meet always, either by
design or by chance. The Duke of _Biron_ who knew that he had been
deeply engaged in the business of the late Duke of _Alecon_, that he had
Negotiated with the Ministers of the King of _Spain_, and of the Duke of
_Savoy_, during the Siege of _Amiens_, that he was full of discontents,
thought that such a one was seeking for a Master. They spoke together and
mixed their grievances, propounding to seek out of the Kingdom what they
could not find within, and to contract an intelligence with the Duke of
_Savoy_; thus after so many examples of unavoidable dangers, the Duke of
_Biron_ did venture upon a Journey full of Rocks and Shelves, under the
conduct of one who was yet wet with the Shipwrack he had lately made.

The Duke went into _Flanders_, for the execution of the Treaty of
_Vervins_, where one _Picoté_ of _Orleans_ spoke to him, and inspired
into him strange desires of raising his Fortune, with those that knew and
admired his defects. The Duke of _Biron_ did hearken to him, and told him
he would be glad to hear him some other time upon that subject. From that
time forwards the _Spaniards_ thought themselves sure of him, and grew
confident, either to have him, or to destroy him: a _French_ Gentleman,
who because of the Civil Wars was retired into _Flanders_, and had some
imployment in the Arch-Dukes Court, gave the first intelligence of it to
the King, who took it kindly, but sent him word, that the Duke of _Biron_
had too much courage and honesty to harbour such a wickedness; being come
back again from _Flanders_ the King wished him to Marry, but he shewed
that his inclinations tended to some other party, then that which was
offered unto him, and though he made shew to court the Daughter of my
Lady _Lucé_, he nevertheless intended to have the natural Sister of the
Duke of _Savoy_, of which the Knight _Breton_ had spoken to him. _La Fin_
had in charge from the Duke of _Biron_, to do all what he could for his
satisfaction. _Picoté_ had made a Journey into _Spain_, only to know and
receive the propositions. _Farges_ a Monk of the Order of _Fisteaux_,
went into _Savoy_, and from thence to _Milan_ to receive Orders how to
pluck of this Plant out of _France_. Things went very slowly; for the
_Spaniards_ do not easily believe the words of the _French_, unless they
be with great effects of rebellion and change; but the Duke of _Savoy_
being at _Paris_, did wholly put out the Flower de Luces he had in his
Heart, and did dispose him to disturb the King so much at home, that he
should have but little time to dispute him the Markdom of _Suluces_, upon
that hope the Duke of _Savoy_ neglected the Execution of the treaty of
Peace made at _Paris_, the War was proclaimed, and the Duke of _Biron_
took the chief places in _Bresse_. Being at _Pierre Chastet_ in the
beginning of _September_, _La Fin_ came to him, and by his order made two
Journeys to St. _Claude_, where _Roncas_ was. The King had notice of it,
but thought it better to dissemble it than to surprise a man he loved in
his infidelity, he thought enough to bid him come into _Savoy_, and to
rid himself of _La Fin_. He did believe that what the King said to him
out of his affection, proceeded from fear, and kept company still with
_La Fin_, and never went to see the King, but with great many attendants,
refusing to take his lodging near his, that he might have more liberty;
he perswaded the King being at _Annessy_, that he did desire to discover
some passages, and therefore desired to have some guides of the Countrey,
but it was to send safely _Renazé_, _La Fin_’s Secretary to the Duke
of _Savoy_, to give him intelligence in what state the Kings Army was,
and to bid d’_Albigny_ retreat, who otherwise had been defeated. This
was about the time that the Duke of _Biron_ did intreat the King to
bestow the Government of the Citadel of _Bourg_ on him, whom he should
name. It is the Nature of the great ones that serve Princes to believe
they deserve all, and to become more dangerous than Enemies if they are
refused what they ask for. The King did declare, that he would bestow the
place upon _de Boisses_. This denial did so trouble the mind of the Duke
of _Biron_, and put him upon such a strange and diabolical resolutions,
that he resolved one Morning, being yet in his Bed at _Chamont_, to kill
the King, as it is expressed in the depositions of _La Fin_ and _Renazé_,
but this took no effect, himself afterwards did abhor the thought of
it. _La Fin_ also went from the Army to conclude the Bargain with the
Duke of _Savoy_, and the Earl of _Fuentes_, he treated first with the
Duke of the _Spanish_ Embassador at _Yurée_, afterwards at _Thurin_ with
_Roncas_, where also came _Picoté_, bringing the answers of the Councel
of _Spain_, upon the propositions of the Duke of _Biron_, with order to
confer with _La Fin_, and to perswade him to make a Journey into _Spain_.
He said plainly, that the King of _Spain_ was resolved to have the Duke
of _Biron_ at any rate. The Duke of _Savoy_ and the Earl of _Fuentes_
appointed a day to be at _Some_ with _La Fin_ and _Picoté_; there the
minds of every one were clearly expressed and understood.

_La Fin_, who was acquainted with all his secret Councels, told the King,
that the Marriage of the third Daughter of the Duke of _Savoy_, was the
fodder and cement of all the treaty, with a promise of five hundred
thousand Crowns, and all the rights of Soveraignty in _Burgundy_.

While _La Fin_ treated in _Italy_ the capitulation of the Duke of
_Biron_, the treaty of Peace was concluded at _Lyons_.

The Duke of _Biron_ had been always against this Peace; when he saw that
it was concluded, and that the King had heard something of his dealings
with _La Fin_, he fained to be very penitent of it, and asked the King
forgiveness in the Cloister of the _Franciscan_ Friers at _Lyons_, and
intreated him most humbly to forgive the evil intentions that the denial
of the Citadel of _Bourg_ had put into his mind. The King did forgive
him, and told him, that he was glad he had trusted to his clemency, and
in the affection he bore to him, of which he would always give him such
tokens, that he should never have occasion to doubt of it. Leaving the
King, he met with the Duke of _Espernon_, and told him, that he would
impart unto him as unto his best friend, the best fortune that ever he
had in his life, which was, that he had discharged his Conscience to
the King, and that he had forgiven him all what was past. The Duke of
_Espernon_ told him, that he was glad of it, but that it was necessary
he should have his pardon in writing; for such faults could not be so
easily blotted out. What, said he, upon what can I rely better than upon
the Kings word; if the Duke of _Biron_ wanteth an abolition, what shall
others do? So they parted, one thinking that his Lyons Courage ought
not to be used so meanly; the other wiser, remembring that a Lyon is
never so well tamed, but one time or another he will prove still a Lyon,
and at last biteth the hand of him that hath wronged him so fiercely,
that he is for ever avenged of him. The Duke of _Espernon_ had reason
to advise him to take an abolition in writing, and the Duke of _Biron_
was not too blame to trust to the Kings Word, who certainly would have
forgiven that fault, if he had done nothing since to renew the Memory of
it. But here is once more to be observed a passage that containeth all
the signs of an implacable Spirit. The Duke of _Biron_ being sent for by
the King to receive his commands, and the effects of his clemency, went
from _Bourg_, and came to lie at _Vimy_. From thence he wrote a Letter
to _La Fin_ that was at _Milan_, and then went to _Lyons_, where he was
received by the King as the prodigal Son, he stayed some time at _Lyons_,
and went to _Vimy_ again, from whence he wrote another Letter to _La Fin_
by _Farges_. As soon as he came to _Bourg_, he sent to _Bosco_, cousin
of _Roncas_ to advance the business. This negotiation did continue at
_Some_ between the Duke of _Savoy_, the Earl of _Fuentes_, and _La Fin_.
The Earl of _Fuentes_ carryed _La Fin_ to _Milan_, and being desirous
to be better informed, upon some points, and finding _La Fin_ not so
firm in his answers, he thought it not good to trust him wholly with the
secret, and resolved to rid himself of him, therefore he sent him back,
and intreated him to see the Duke of _Savoy_ in his way. He had the
good fortune to go by the way of the _Grisons_, and so through _Basle_,
_Porentru_, and _Besancon_, for _Renazé_ his Secretary, that went through
_Savoy_, was there Arrested and made Prisoner. The work nevertheless
went on; _Alphonsus_, _Casal_, and _Roncas_, did continue it with the
Baron of _Lux_, and in the mean time the Duke of _Biron_ plaid his part,
having sent an express into _Spain_, though he were then with the King,
who loth to loose him, kept him near, carryed him to see the Frontier
Towns, and sent him Embassador into _England_, where he saw the head of
the Earl of _Essex_, a late example of justice upon those who will be
feared by their Masters, and abuse their favour. At his return he made a
Journey into _Gascony_, where he was visited and honoured by the Nobility
of the Countrey, as a Prince; and being come to _Dijon_, he went into
_Switzerland_, to make an end of the renewing of the Alliance between
the King and the _Switzers_, where he continued still his practises with
the Earl of _Fuentes_, to whom he sent his secretary, under pretence
to send his Pages into the Garrisons of _Palma_, for the _Venetians_.
Being come back from _Switzerland_, he came not to the King to give an
account of his negotiation, excusing himself upon the convocation of the
Estates in the Province. The King, that had some notice of these broils
by _Combelles_, was infinitely desirous to speak with _La Fin_ to know
the truth of it. _La Fin_, who was highly incensed, that the Baron of
_Lux_ would have all the fruit of this negotiation, and that _Renazée_
is kept Prisoner in _Savoy_, sent _Cerezat_ to the Duke of _Biron_ to
let him know that he could be no longer his Servant, if his Secretary
was not set at liberty, and that he could no longer defer to go to the
King, desiring also to know what he should say upon the things that were
past. He slighted the first of these propositions, and spoke of _Renazée_
as of one that was not to be reckoned among the living; concerning the
other, he told _Cerezat_ that he was of opinion he might go to the Court
with a small train, and that he should prepare himself at the first to
receive ill language and contempt from the King, which he should sweeten
by intreating him to believe, that the Journey he had made into _Italy_
had no other design than to visit our Lady of _Loretta_: And that passing
through _Milan_ and _Thurin_ he had been chared to propound the Marriage
between him and the third Daughter of _Savoy_, to which he would not
hearken, because the King would take care to provide for him. He did
intreat and adjure _Cerezat_ to tell _La Fin_, that he should rid himself
of all those that travailed with him, and chiefly of a Curate, and that
he should secure his Papers, if he had not rather to burn them. In a
word, to consider, his life, his fortune, his honour, were in his Hands.

_La Fin_ came to Court at the end of Lent, and saw the King at the
Wine-press of _Fountainbleau_, and after that at the mid way. He spake
first to the King, after to _Villeroy_, and after to the Chancellor
in his house at _Fontainbleau_, and with _Rhosny_ in the Forrest, and
with _Sillery_ in the Wine-press; all with horror saw the writings, and
heard his designs. The King could hardly believe such a wickedness; for
who could have believed that he, who had driven the _Spaniard_ from the
Frontiers of _Picardy_, would let him in again by that of _Burgundy_?
that he who had a hundred times beaten and defeated them, could contract
a friendship with them, and conspire with them against the service of his
Prince, and the love of his Countrey? that he who hated them to death,
would have trusted his life in their Hands? He had shewed himself so
much their Enemy, that seeing his Father would not charge the Prince of
_Parma_ in an advantagious place, said aloud, that if he were King for 24
hours, he would cause the head of the Marshall of _Biron_ to be cut off.
He pronounced against his Father the Sentence that was to be executed
once upon him.

_La Fin_ shewed the King so many true and undeniable tokens of this
conspiracy, that he was fained to believe more that he desired. He told
him all what did pass in his Journeys to the Duke of _Savoy_, and the
Earl of _Fuentes_ concerning the Duke of _Biron_, saying, that for his
part he would have been glad that the War had continued, that he might
have benifitted himself therein; but finding that his sacred person was
not excepted, and that there were cruel designs made against it, either
to kill him, or to carry him prisoner into _Spain_, he was resolved to
give him notice of it, choosing rather to disoblige the Servant than
the Master. The King full of clemency and goodness, was extreamly sorry
to see such an unnatural conspiracy: Nevertheless he said, that if the
Conspirators did their duty, and gave him means to prevent the designs of
his Enemies, he would forgive them. If they remember what they owe me, I
will not forget what I owe them; they shall find me as full of clemency,
as they are void of affection: I would not have the Duke of _Biron_ to
be the first example of my Justice, and to be the cause that my Reign,
which hitherto hath been like an Air, calm and pure, should upon a
sudden be disturbed with Clouds and Lightning, and so made a resolution,
that if the Duke of _Biron_ should tell him the truth, he would forgive
him, his Councel was of the same advice, provided he would shew himself
thenceforth as forward for his service against his Enemies, as he had
been earnest to do mischief.

Out of many Papers that _la Fin_ put into the Kings hands, there were
seven and twenty pickt out, which onely spoke of him; the King being
unwilling to discover the rest of the Conspirators, and intending that
the punishment of one should serve for example to all the rest.

The Chancellor kept those Papers with such care, that he caused them to
be sowed in his Doublet, that no body might have a sight of them till it
was time. The Baron of _Lux_ was yet at _Fountainbleau_, when _la Fin_
came thither.

The King told him that he was very well pleased, that _la Fin_ had spoken
to him so honourably and wisely of the Duke of _Biron_, and that he was
confident now, that the intentions of the Duke of _Biron_ were righteous
and sincere. The Baron of _Lux_ did not perceive the Kings anger, so much
the more dangerous that it was hidden; he went back again to _Dijon_
very well pleased, that the things were always in the same state. _La
Fin_ did write to the Duke of _Biron_ that he had satisfied the King
concerning his actions, and had told him onely what might serve for his
justification. The King did manage this business so prudently, that
the success of it was fortunate, he was well informed of all the Dukes
designs, and desired to hear them out of his own mouth, that he might
have occasion to forgive him, for that purpose he sent to him the Lord
d’_Escures_, bidding him to come, because he had a mind to trust him with
the Army that he was raising upon the Frontiers, he excused himself, and
said that the enemy being so near, it would be a shame to him to turn his
back, and that the States of the Province were convented at _Dijon_, and
therefore could not forsake neither the Frontiers nor the States. The
_Vidame_ of _Chartres_ made a Journey to him, and assured him that his
Uncle _la Fin_ had said nothing to his prejudice.

The persuasions of the President _Janin_ were more powerful for
flattering the Duke in his humour, he also made him sensible of the
Kings power and anger in case of refusal; his friends gave him contrary
advices, and desired him not to stir, and to make his peace afar off;
the _Bastille_ is a repairing said they, and the common talk is, that
it is for such one as less thinketh upon it: the King hath been heard
say, that they cut heads in _England_, and that some shall compel him
upon that example to change his wonted Clemency into a just severity:
in conclusion, they advise him to mistrust all things, and to beware of
those that persuaded him to come; others did assure him of the contrary,
and that his coming should dissipate all mistrusts, suspicions and
jealousies.

The Duke of _Biron_ holdeth here the Wolf by the ears, for let him come
or not, there is danger; by not coming he accuseth himself, and the King
swore he would fetch him himself; and in coming, his conscience was a
witness against him, that the same fault can hardly be forgiven twice. He
seeth _la Fin_ retired into his House and living in peace, and hath so
good an opinion of his own Valour, that he thinketh no body so bold as to
seize upon him. The discourses of reason, the discerning of the truth,
serve no more to a wicked and passionate man, then the Wings serve to a
Bird, when they are clogged with Bird-lime. But now we talk of Birds,
there were several ill _Omens_ of his journey, one Bird of Prey called
a Duck was found in his Closet, no body knowing which way it was come
in; he commanded it to be carefully kept and lookt to, but as soon as
the Duke was upon his journey the Bird died. Presently after the Horse
that the Arch-Duke had given him, called the _Pastrave_, became mad,
and killed himself, so did another that was given him by the Duke of
_Florence_, another that the Duke of _Lorrain_ had given him, fell into
a consumption. He came to _Fountainbleau_ when he was no more expected,
and the King was resolved to get on Horseback and to fetch him. As his
Majesty went about six of the Clock into the great Garden, he was heard
to say unto the Lord of _Souvray_, _he will not come_, he had no sooner
ended the words, but the Duke appeared among seven or eight, he drew
near, and being yet a pretty way off, he made three great Congies, the
King did embrace him, and the first words he spoke to the King, were
about the delaying of his coming. The King heard but few words of it,
and took him by the hand to walk, and to shew him his buildings; as he
passed from one Garden into another, the Duke of _Espernon_ took occasion
to salute him, and to whisper him in the ear, that in his coming he had
believed his courage more, then the Councel of his friends.

In all the discourse he had with the King, there was observed a great
coldness in the Kings face, and a great deal of fire in the Dukes words.
The King told him of the evil way which he had taken, the end of which
could be nothing but ruine, despair and confusion. The Duke answered that
he was not come to ask forgiveness, not to justifie himself, with many
other frivolous and impudent words, which the Kings presence and his own
duty ought to have restrained. The time of dinner being come, he asked
the Duke of _Espernon_ to dine with him, because his Train was not yet
come; this was the first fault of his carriage, for he ought to dine at
the Table of the great Master, and to harbour in no other House then that
of the King, seeing his own was not open.

After dinner they came to see the King, who having walked one turn or two
about the dinning-room, entered into his Closet, bidding two or three to
go in with him, and saying nothing to the Duke of _Biron_, who was at the
corner of the Bed near the Chair, taking notice that he was not looked
upon as formerly.

The Marquess of _Rhosny_ went into the Closet, passing by the Duke of
_Biron_ without taking notice of him, and after he had stayed there
about half an hour, he came and saluted the Duke of _Biron_, and told
him the King asked for him; there he was exhorted not to conceal what
time would ere long discover, and of what he was so well informed, that
the desire he had to know it from himself, was meerly because no body
else should take notice of it. The Duke of _Biron_ who thought that _la
Fin_ had revealed nothing, stood still upon the protestations of his
own innocency, beseeching the King to do him justice, of those who went
about to oppress him with unsufferable calumnies, or to permit him to do
himself reason. The King carried him to the Tennis-court, where the Duke
took upon him to order the match, and said that the Duke of _Espernon_
and himself would hold it against the King and the Earl of _Soisson_, the
Duke of _Espernon_ answered presently: you play well, but you do not make
your matches well; which was observed by the King and the standers by.
Supper time being come, he did sup at the Table of the great Master, to
repare the fault he had done in the morning. Every one did perceive that
he was not contented, for he eat little or nothing, and no body spoke to
him, every one holding him already for a cast-away. The King in the mean
while was walking in his Chamber, meditating some great resolution, and
he was heard to say these words, _he must either bow or break_.

That evening past away so quietly, that many thought it would be a
Thunder with much noise and little hurt. The King commanded the Earl of
_Soissons_ to go to the Duke of _Biron_, and to do his best to break the
hardness of his heart, and to draw the truth out of him; he went and
intreated him to satisfie the King in what he desired to know from him,
and to be afraid of the Kings displeasure and indignation. The Duke of
_Biron_ for answer told him, that the King could not complain but of the
good services he had done to him, and that he himself had great occasion
to complain of the King who mistrusted him after so many trials and
experiments of his faithfulness, and that he should never have more of
him then he had at his first coming; the Earl of _Soissons_, seeing his
obstinacy, left him.

The next day early the King walking in the little Garden, sent for the
Duke of _Biron_, and spoke to him a great while, thinking to overcome
his obstinacy, and to give him means to escape the danger he was running
into; he was seen a great while with his Hat off, his eyes lifted up to
Heaven, smiting his breast, and making great protestations to uphold his
innocency; there appeared then in the Kings face a great deal of anger,
and in that of the Duke of _Biron_ a great deal of fire and violence,
all his words were nothing but threatnings, lightnings, ruines, and Hell
against those that had spoken ill of him; from thence he went to dinner,
and met with a man who brought him a Letter, to advise him to look to
himself, he shewed it to the Captain of his Guards, and made slight of
it, and said, he would be beholding to his valor for his life, and not
to a flight; all the afternoon the King stayed in the Gallery, and
spoke four hours to the Lord of _la Curée_, the Queen being present and
speaking never a word; the King was in a great perplexity of mind, before
he could resolve himself. The Lords of _Vileroy_, _Sillery_ and _Geure_
were seen often to go to and fro, which made some suspect, that it was
to begin by the execution in so great a crime; but the King was against
that, such proceedings had been blamed in his Predecessor, he would have
every body to know that he had authority and power enough to exterminate
his enemies, according to the Laws.

The resolution was taken to have him arrested, and also the Earl of
_Auvergne_, the King would not have them to be taken in the Castle, but
in their own Lodgings; the Duke of _Biron_, who was in some suspicion
of it, and had prepared himself to what he could, neither prevent nor
hinder, did imagine that there was no fear of any thing in the Kings
Chamber, and that all the danger should be at the going out, and
therefore by time had provided himself with a short Sword, with which he
promised to make himself room through all dangers. They represented to
the King, that if he were Arrested any where but in the Castle, it could
not be done without bloodshed, and that it was no matter where the Lyon
was taken, so that profit might arise of his prize.

It was perceived that in the same Gallery the King sent for _Vitry_ and
_Pralin_, two Captains of his Guards, and gave them the order he would
have to be observed for the execution of his commands, and then called
for his Supper. The Duke of _Biron_ was at supper in the Lord _Montignys_
Lodging, where he spoke more highly and bravely then ever of his Deserts,
and of the friends he had made lately in _Switzerland_; then began to
fall upon the praises of the late King of _Spain_, extolling his Piety,
Justice and liberality; _Montigny_ stopt him, saying, that the greatest
commendation that could be given to his memory, was, that he had put
his own Son to death, for endeavouring to trouble his Estate; this word
stopt those of the Duke of _Biron_, who answered only with his eyes, and
thought upon it with some amazement. After supper the Earl of _Auvergne_
and the Duke of _Biron_ came to the King, who was walking in the Garden,
the King making an end of his walk did invite the Duke of _Biron_ to
play at Cards, they went into the Queens Cnamber, the Earl of _Auvergne_
passing by the Duke of _Biron_ told him softly, _we are undone_; the Game
begun at the _primara_, the Queen was one of the Gamsters, the Duke of
_Biron_ another, and two more. The King went into his Closet, divided
between two contrary passions; the love he had formerly for the Duke of
_Biron_, the knowledge he had of his valour, and the remembrance of his
services, excluded all thoughts of his Justice; on the other side, the
fear of troubles in his Estate, the horrid effects of so unnatural a
conspiracy did accuse his Clemency of cruelty, if he went about to prefer
the particular good to the publick, he prayed to God to assist him with
his Holy Spirit, to appease the troubles of his soul, and to strengthen
him with a Holy resolution, that he might do what was for the good of his
people, upon whom he Reigned by his only Grace; his prayer being ended,
all the difficulties that troubled his soul vanished away, there remained
only a firm resolution, to put the Duke into the hands of Justice, if he
could not draw the truth out of him; the Game went on still, the King
took sometimes the Queens Cards, expecting the appointed time. The Earl
of _Auvergne_ was gone to his Lodging, the King sent for him, and walked
in the Chamber, while the Duke thought upon nothing but his play. _De
Varennes_ Lieutenant of his Troop faining to take up his Cloak, whispered
him softly that he was undone; this word did trouble him so much, that
he neglected his play, and oversaw himself, the Queen gave him notice of
it; the King did bid them to give over playing, and commanded every one
to retire, he went into his Closet, and took the Dake of _Biron_ with
him, whose good and bad fortune depended from an answer pleasing his
Majesty, who bid him once for all to tell what he had done with the Duke
of _Savoy_ and the Earl of _Fuentes_, assuring him, that his clemency
should be greater than his fault. The Duke of _Biron_ answered the King
more proudly than ever, that it was to press an honest man too much, that
he never had any other design, but what he had told him already. _Would
to God it were so_, said the King. You will not tell me: Farewell, good
night.

As he went out of the Closet, and had passed the Chamber door, he met
_Vitry_, who with his right hand seized upon the Hilt of his Sword, and
with his left upon his right Arm, saying, _The King hath commanded me to
give him an account of your Person, give up your Sword._ _You jeer_, said
the Duke. _No my Lord, he hath so commanded me._ The Duke of _Biron_
answered, _I pray thee let me speak to the King._ No my Lord, the King is
gone to Bed. He saw the Duke of _Monbazon_, and desired him to intreat
the King, that he might surrender it into his own Hands. The King sent
word to _Vitry_ to obey his commands. The Duke was fained to suffer his
Sword to be taken from him; saying, _My Sword that hath done so many good
services!_ Yes my Lord, give me your Sword, said _Vitry_. To me, said the
Duke, that have served the King so well, that my Sword should be taken
from me, my Sword that hath made an end of the War, and given Peace to
_France_, that my Sword, which could not be taken by my Enemies, should
be taken away by my Friends. All these complaints availed nothing; he
ungirted his Sword with his left hand, and gave it to _Vitry_, looking
about if he could seize upon any other, but care was taken for that.

When he saw all the Guards in order in the Gallery, he thought he should
have been Massacred upon the place, and cryed to them, fellow Souldiers
give me a little time to pray to God, and let me have some Firebrand
or Candlestick in my hand, that I may have the Honour to die defending
my self. He was answered, that no Body would offend him, that his best
defence was to obey the King, who commanded to lead him to Bed, you
see said he, how the good Catholicks are used. He was carryed into the
Arms Closet, where he neither slept nor lay down, but past the night in
blasphemies against God, and reviling words against the King.

_Pralin_ was staying for the Earl of _Auvergne_ at the Castle Gate, and
when he offered to go out to his lodging; stay my Lord, you are the Kings
Prisoner. The Earl astonished, answered I, I? and _Pralin_ answered, yes
my Lord, you, I Arrest you by the King, and make you his Prisoner, give
up your Sword, take it said the Earl it never killed any thing but Boars,
if you had given me notice of this, I should have been in Bed and asleep
two hours ago.

The next day about dinner time the Duke of _Biron_ sent word to the King,
that if he did not take care of the Province of _Burgundy_, it would be
lost, because the Baron of _Lux_ would let in the _Spaniards_ as soon as
he should have notice of his detention. The King was very much offended
at this message, and said, see the impudence and boldness of the Duke of
_Biron_, who sendeth me word that _Burgundy_ is lost, if I do not look to
it. His obstinacy hath undone him, if he would have confessed the truth
of a thing that I have under his hand, he should not be where he is. I
wish I had paid 200000. Crowns, and he had given me the means to forgive
him. I never loved any man so much, I would have trusted him with my Son
and my Kingdom. ’Tis true, he hath served me well, but he cannot deny
but that I have saved his life three times; I rescued him once from the
hands of the Enemy at _Fontain Francoise_, so wounded and astonished with
blows, that as I plaid the part of a Souldier to save him, I was also
fained to make that of a Captain to make the retreat; for he told me he
was not in a case to do it.

The _Saturday_ next the prisoners were carryed to _Paris_ by water, and
put into the _Bastille_ in several Chambers. The Duke of _Biron_ was put
into that, called of the Saints famous, for the Prison of the Constable
of Saint _Paul_, executed in the time of _Lewis_ the XI. and the Earl in
the Chamber above him.

The care, the order and vigilancy, with which he was guarded, did put
him in some amazement; for his Guards waited on him without Arms, and
served him with a Knife without a point, which made him say, that it was
the way to the Grave (the place of Execution.) But when he knew that the
Hangman of _Paris_ was a _Burgundian_, he remembred that _La Brosse_ an
Astrologer had foretold him sometimes, seeing his Horoscope, which he
fained to be that of one of his friends, that he should be beheaded, and
_Cæsar_ a Magician, that a blow of a _Burgundian_ given behind; should
hinder him to attain the Kingdom.

The Arch-Bishop of _Bourges_ went to see him, and endeavoured to settle
his Conscience, and to disswade him from some Atheistical opinions that
he had: _Villeroy_ and _Sillery_ went also to see him, and by the Kings
Command, and at his request.

Few days after, the King being at St. _Mourder_, _Fossez_, the _Lords
la Force_, the Earl of _Roussy_, Brother in Law to the Duke of _Biron_,
Saint _Blancard_ his Brother, _Chasteau-neuf_, _Themines_, _Salignac_,
St. _Angel_, _Longuac_, Friends and Kinsmen of the Duke of _Biron_, went
and cast themselves at the Kings feet, to implore his Mercy, and that
he would be pleased to moderate the severity of his Justice, requesting
that the same clemency which he had shewed to many others that had as
grievously offended him, would at least save his life, and confine him
into such a place, where he might do no harm, that their whole Kindred
might not be branded with Infamy, and have a regard to his Fathers
service and his, which though they were not equal to his offence, yet at
least to consider, that he was only guilty for his intention.

The King bid them rise, and told them, that their requests were not
displeasing to him. That he would not be like his Predecessors, who
would not suffer any body to intercede for those that were guilty of
high Treason. The King _Francis_ II. would never give a hearing to the
Wife of the Prince of _Condé_ my Uncle. Concerning the clemency you
would have me shew to the Duke of _Biron_; it should not be clemency but
cruelty, if it were only my particular Interest, I would forgive him, as
I do now with all my heart; but my Kingdom and my Children, to whom I
owe much, are concerned in it; or they might reproach me hence forwards,
that I have tollerated an evil which I might have prevented; my Life,
that of my Children, and the preservation of my Kingdom, are concerned
in it. I will leave it to the course of Justice, you shall see what
Judgement shall be given: I will contribute what I can to his Innocency,
I give you leave to do the same till he be found guilty of high Treason;
for then the Father cannot intercede for the Son, nor the Son for the
Father; the Wife for the Husband, nor the Brother for the Brother. Do
not become odious to me for the love you bear him: As for the note of
Infamy, there is none but himself. Have the Constable of St. _Paul_, from
whom I derive my Pedigree, and the Duke of _Nemours_, of who I am Heir
(both beheaded) left any note of Infamy upon their Posterity, should
not the Prince of _Condé_ my Uncle have been beheaded the next day, if
King _Francis_ the II. had not dyed? Therefore ye that are Kinsmen to
the Duke of _Biron_, cannot be noted with Infamy, if you continue in
your faithfulness, as (I assure my self) you will. And I am so far from
depriving you of your Offices, that if any new one should fall, I would
bestow them upon you: I am more sorry for his fault than you can be; but
to conspire against me that am his King and Benefactor, is a crime that I
cannot forgive, without losing my self, my Wife, my Son, and my Estate,
I know you to be so good _French_ men, that you would not have the last,
and shall take Patience for the first. Thus the King dismissed him, and
sent his Commission to the Court of Parliament, to decide the business.
The Process was framed in the _Bastille_, by the Lords of _Achilles de
Harlay_, first President in the Court of Parliament of _Paris_, _Nicolas
Potier_ second President, _Stephen Fleury_, and _Philibert_ of _Thurin_,
Councellors in the same Court. They asked him if he did not write in
Cyphers, he denyed it, then were shewed unto him several Letters, written
and sealed with his own hand, which did witness his Intelligences with
the _Spaniard_ and the Duke of _Savoy_, and contained advices that he
gave of the wants that were in the Kings Army; How little Money he had
to maintain the War, and to satisfie the _Suitzers_ of the discontent of
the _French_ Nobility, and how several _French_ Troops might easily be
defeated, and that to divert the Kings forces it was necessary to invade
_Provence_, and did much press upon the 50000. Crowns, and the 4000 men
promised or else said, all is lost. Some of these things he confessed,
and did so intangle and contradict himself, that the Commissioners had
pity on his indiscretion.

He was asked what opinion he had of _La Fin_, he said he took him for
an honest Gentleman, his Friend and Kinsman, his Evidences being read
to him, and himself brought face to face, he did with the most horrid
Imprecations and Blasphemies in the World deny them, and charged _La Fin_
with the most horrid Crimes that can be Imagined, calling still God for
a Witness of his Innocency; _La Fin_ stood firm in the confirming of his
Evidence, and did more particularly declare the whole conspiracy. The
Duke answered, that if _Renazé_ were there he would tell the contrary,
_Renazé_, who had a little while before escaped his Prison in _Piemont_,
was brought before him, and confirmed all what _La Fin_ had said.

Next to that was brought one of the Kings waiting men, who witnessed,
that having lyen in his Chamber by the Kings command, the first night of
his Imprisonment he had adjured him, by several offers and promises of
rewards, to give notice to his Secretaries to be out of the way for some
days, and to tell the Earl of _Roussy_ his Brother in Law, that he should
send presently to _Dijon_, to give the same advice to those that were
left there, and above all that if they were examined; they should all
constantly deny that ever he did write in Cyphers.

Thus the business having been thorowly examined, it remained only to
proceed unto Judgment; but the Prisoner being a Peer of _France_, (the
King having erected the Barony of _Biron_ into a Dukedom) by the Laws the
Prisoner could not be judged, but by his Peers, which being summoned,
and not appearing, the Court of Parliament being authorised by the Kings
Commission, proceeded to Judgement.

The 23 of _July_ 1602. the Chancellor, with the _Maisses_ and
_Pontcarré_, Privy Councellors, went to the Parliament, where all
the Chambers were assembled together. There he made known the Kings
intention, in a business, wherein the good of the Kingdom was so
much concerned, and represented on one part the quality of a Person,
commendable for his services; but on the other, the foulness of the
Crime, for the Judgement of which the King did rely upon the integrity
and prudence of the Court. The Kings Attorney, and Soliciter, having
represented to the Court, that the Peers summoned, gave no appearance,
and that the Prisoners petition (who asked for Councel), was not to
be received. The Court proceeded to examine the Evidences, whereupon
they sat three times, after which the Prisoner was brought from the
_Bastille_, by _Montigny_ Governour of _Paris_, and _Vitry_, Captain of
the Kings Guards, in a close Barge, covered with Tapistry, and followed
by two other Barges full of Souldiers, and _Switzers_. He entred into the
Palace, through the Garden of the first President, and rested himself in
one of the Chambers, where he was offered a Breakfast.

The time being come, he was to be heard, the Recorder went and called
him into the Guild-hall, where when he saw one Hundred and twelve Judges
before his face, he was some thing daunted, and was made to sit within
the Bar upon a joint stool; where he sat in such a posture, as stretching
forth his right foot, and having his Cloak under his arm, and his left
hand upon his side, he kept the right one free, either to stretch it
forth to Heaven, or to smite his brest, when occasion served. The
Chancellor did so frame his discourse, that he never named him by his
name, nor that of his qualities.

Of many evidences there was five chiefly urged against him.

The first to have been conversant with one _Picotée_, born in _Orleans_,
and refugied in _Flanders_, to keep intelligence with the Arch-duke, and
to have give him 150. Crowns for two journeys to that end.

The second to have treated with the Duke of _Savoy_, three days after his
arrival to _Paris_ without the Kings leave, and to have offered him all
assistance and service against any person whatsoever, upon the hope or
promiss of marrying his third daughter.

The third to have kept intelligence with the said Duke in taking of the
City of _Bourg_ and other places, giving him advice how he might defeat
the Kings Army, and destroy his person, with many other circumstances to
that purpose.

The fourth to have sent by _Renazée_ a note to the Governour of the Fort
of Saint _Catherine_, promising to bring the King before the said Fort,
so near that he might be either killed or taken, telling what cloths
he himself would wear, and what Horse he would ride, that he might be
distinguished.

To have sent several times _la Fin_ to treat with the Duke of _Savoy_,
and the Earl of _Fuentes_ against the Kings service.

These are the first confessions and acknowledgements that the Prisoner
made before the Commissioners in the Bastille, but now he thinketh, he
may as lightly deny them, as he had unadvisedly before confessed them.

Upon the first Article he answered, that _Picoté_ being once his
Prisoner, had offered his service for the reduction of the Town of
_Seurre_ in _Burgundy_, and that the King had approved of it, that it is
true he had given him the said sum, but it was as a reward for his pains
and charges in this negotiation, which sum he hath charged upon the Kings
account, with some other small ones, laid out by him for the King; that
since the reduction of the said Town he had not seen _Picoté_ but in
_Flanders_, when he went thither Embassadour for the confirmation of the
Peace, where the said _Picotée_ came to him with many others, intreating
him he would be pleased to mediate with the King, for the liberty of
returning into their Countrey, and enjoying their Estates, and that he
did wish them to go to the Lords _Belieure_ and _Sillery_, who would
prescribe them what orders they were to follow in this business, and
never had any other conversation with _Picoté_.

Upon the second, That he could not have treated with the Duke of _Savoy_
three days after his arrival at _Paris_, seeing that himself did not come
there but a fortnigh-after, and that _la Fin_ came but after him, that
all his discourses with him were in publick and before witnesses, and
therefore could not be suspected; that _Roncas_ had sometimes mentioned
to him the Marriage of the third daughter of the Duke, and that he did
impart it to the King; that his Majesty having sent him word by _la
Force_ his Brother in Law, that he did not approve of it, he never
thought of it since; that the intelligence he is accused to have kept
with the Duke of _Savoy_, is confuted enough by what he did, for when the
King had commanded him to wait and keep company to the Duke in his return
from _France_, and to shew him the strongest places upon the Frontiers of
_Burgundy_, he did humbly excuse himself to the King of it, saying, that
he foresaw well enough that the Duke would not keep the Treaty of Peace,
and that it would be a great grief to him to make War against a Prince,
with whom he should have kept company, and made good cheer; and that he
did advise the Baron of _Lux_ to let him see only the weaker places, that
he might not know the strength of the Countrey.

Upon the third, That if he had kept correspondence with the Duke of
_Savoy_, he would not have undertaken the taking of _Bourg_, almost
against the Kings will, without any other help then of those that were
ordinarily with him; that of fourty Convoys that were brought to relieve
the Town, he had routed thirty seven, and the other three entered in his
absence; that the King knoweth very well he was offered 200000. Crowns
to let the succours enter into the Citadel of _Bourg_; that although his
Majesty had commanded him in the time of a Truce made with the Duke of
_Savoy_, to let those of the Citadel of _Bourg_ have every day 400. Loafs
of Bread, 50. bottles of Wine, half an Oxe, and six Sheep, he did only
let them have fifty bottles of Wine and one Sheep, by which means the
Town was surrendred within the time promised; that if he had had any evil
design against the King and Kingdom, he would not so freely and willingly
put the Town into the hands of him that is now Governour of it; that the
Governours of Places that were in the Duke’s service, and are now in that
of the King, can witness whether he shewed them any favour; that for his
giving advice to the Duke to defeat the Regiment of _Chambauld_, he will
prove that _Chambauld_ did not come into the Army, but one Month after
the time mentioned in his Calumny; besides that, this advice was without
appearance of reason, for from _Chambauld_’s quarters to his, there was
at least six days journey, and as much to go to the Duke, and as much
to come back, besides the time required for the marching of the Forces;
therefore all that was a meer invention of _la Fin_.

Upon the fourth, That he intreated his Majesty to call to memory, that he
was the onely man who dissuaded him to go and view the Fort, representing
unto him that there was in it extraordinary good Gunners, and that he
could not view it without great danger, and upon that he offered the King
to bring him the next day the Plat-form of it, and to take it with 500.
Musquettiers, and that himself would be in the Head of them.

Upon the fifth, That it was true all the evil he had done was in two
Months time that _la Fin_ had been with him, during which, he did hearken
and write more then he ought: but that with the same he had written, he
had so long served the King, that it was enough to prove the sincerity
of his intentions; that the refusal of the Citadel of _Bourg_, which he
thought the King had promised him, had put him into such a discontent,
that he found himself in a capacity to hearken to any thing, and to do
any thing, that if he had been a Protestant, it may be the place should
have been refused him no more then it was to _de Boaisse_, who was such
an one, as he told the King himself at _Lyon_; that _la Fin_ had also
once told him, that the King speaking of him, and of his Father, said,
that God had done well for to take him out of this world when he was
killed, for he was a very chargeable and unprofitable servant; and for
the Son, it was not all Gold that shined; that these words had so much
incensed him, that he could have found in his heart to be all covered
with blood. Upon that the Chancellor asked him of what blood he meaned?
he answered, of my own: desiring not to live any longer, after he had
heard such reproches, as blemished the services of his Father and his
own; that nevertheless his anger and discontent went never so far, as to
attempt upon the King; that his fault was only in words, and it may be
little in Writting; that his Majesty seeing with how much ingenuity he
did acknowledge his fault, had forgiven him all what was past, in the
presence of the Lords _Villeroy_ and _Sillery_, and that if since that
time he was found to have done any thing amiss, he would blame his Judges
of Injustice, if they did not condemn him to death, that if he had done
nothing amiss since, he thought the Kings pardon to be sufficient for
what was, and if there was need to ask for it again, his knees were as
supple and plyable as ever.

But a Letter, which he had written to _la Fin_ since the pardon of
_Lyon_, and the Birth of the Dolphin, did spoil all, for it was a
manifest evidence of the continuation of his ill designs, and the
Chancellor having produced it, he answered, he would never deny his
hand, but that _Imbert_ and _Renazée_ Domestick Servants to _la Fin_
could counterfeit it; that though he might have some ill thoughts, he
had always well done; that although the King would not forgive him this
fault, it was not in the power of men to condemn him justly for single
words, which were contradicted by the effects; that his consolation was
in his misfortune, his Judges were not ignorant of the services he had
done to the Kingdom, which he had Sealed with five and thirty wounds;
that his body whose life and death was in the disposition of their
Justice, had not a vain but had bleeded for their service, and to restore
them into their places, from whence the League had driven them; that the
hand which had written the Letters produced against him, was the same
that had done contrary to what it did write; that he had written and
spoke more then he ought, but that it could not be proved he had ever ill
done; that there was no Law that punished with death the lightness of a
single word or motion of the thoughts; that anger and discontent had made
him capable of saying and doing any thing, but that his reason had not
given leave to say or to do, ought but what deserveth to be commended;
which words were as carefully considered, as he repeated them often with
several Oaths and Imprecations.

Upon that the Chancellor having asked him why then he did not open
himself more to the King, who desired him with great affection to do
it at _Fountain-bleau_, seeing he knew in his conscience to have done
nothing against his duty since his pardon. There he cut himself in his
answer, and said he thought _la Fin_ had revealed nothing of what was
between them, and that he had lately assured him so with Oaths and
fearful imprecations, that he would never have thought _la Fin_ had been
such a damnable man, as to reveal that which with so many deep Oaths and
Imprecations they had promised to keep secret between themselves; that
having propounded the question to a Monk of the Order of _Minimes_ at
_Lyon_, whether he might with a safe conscience reveal what was between
them, and what he had promised with Oath to _la Fin_ to keep secret,
because he suspected that _la Fin_ would deceive him, and tell all to
the King, and so ruine him. The _Minime_ had answered, that seeing they
had no more intention to put in execution the things they had projected,
he was not to reveal them, and if _la Fin_ did it, he should go to Hell,
and himself to Heaven; that he did so firmly believe this, that although
the Archbishop of _Bourges_ had visited him in Prison, and alledged many
reasons to the contrary, yet his soul was so settled in that belief, that
he thought it was only the part of an Atheist to swear with intention to
deceive.

Upon this he begin to accuse _la Fin_ of the most execrable crimes that
a man is capable of, saying that he made use of _Renazée_ for _Sodomy_
that he was a Witch, and had ordinary communication with the Devils,
that he had so be witched him with enchanted Waters and Wax Images, that
spoke, that he was constrained to submit himself to all his will; that
he never spoke to him but whispering, and in unknown words, and after
he had kissed him in the left eye, and he could not deny but he had
shewed him a Wax Image, speaking and saying, _Rex impie morieris_, _thou
shalt die ungodly King_, and called him continually his Master, Lord,
Prince and King; that he was a false Coiner, and had persuaded him many
times to attempt upon the King, but that he would never hearken to it,
that the quality of the Accusators was to be considered, who not only
were partners, but instigators of the Fact; that certainly the Duke of
_Savoy_ was his mortal enemy, for having since his pardon left of all
his intelligences with him, and seeing that after a long detention he
had released _Renazée_, to come and to be a witness against him; that
the King had forgiven him at _Lyon_ and that upon his acknowledging many
times to the King, that the refusal of the Citadel of _Bourg_ had very
much incensed him, his Majesty did comfort him with these words. Marshal
never remember _Bourg_, and I will never remember what is past, that in
22 Months after he had not offended, that if he had continued his ill
designs, he might have done it easily in _England_ and _Switzerland_.
That above 100. Gentlemen shall be Witnesses of his first Embassy,
and for the second, he desireth no other Witnesses than the Kings
Embassadors themselves, that if they would be pleased to consider how
he was come, and in what case he had left the Province of _Burgundy_,
it was impossible to have an ill opinion of his designs; for there was
not one Souldier in all the Countrey, and at his going away he gave no
other charge to the Commanders and Captains, than to serve the King
faithfully, that every one disswaded him to come to Court, and in the
way he received many Letters to that purpose, that he was come upon the
Kings word, trusting upon his own Conscience and Innocency. If the King
be not pleased to consider my services (said he to the Court) and those
assurances he hath given me of his Mercy, I acknowledge my self guilty of
Death, and do not expect my life from his Justice, but from yours, (my
Lords) who will remember better than he what dangers I have undergone
for his service. I confess I had a mind to do ill, but I never proceeded
to effects: It would be a hard matter if I should be the first in whom
thoughts should be punished; Great offences require great clemency. I
do implore that of the King, and nevertheless I am the onely one in
_France_, that is made an example of his severity, and that can have no
hope in his clemency, which he never denyed to those that had done worse:
However I trust more in you my Lords, than I do in the King, who having
heretofore looked upon me with his Eyes of love, looketh upon me now with
those of his anger, and thinketh it a Vertue to be cruel unto me, and a
Vice to excercise upon me the act of clemency.

Thus pleaded the Prisoner, with so much eloquency and boldness, that if
his Judges had not seen evidently the truth of the fact, under his own
Hand and Seal, the respect of his first condition might have perswaded
them to believe his Innocency, and to take compassion of his ruined
fortune.

The Court did hear him as long as he would speak, with so much patience,
that never a man had the like audience. The Prisoner spoke so much, that
his last reasons were found contrary to his first, his allegations did
not shew his Innocency; for the Embassadors themselves which he took for
Witnesses of his carryage in _Switzerland_, did report many words of his,
which shewed his anger and passion. Besides the King had not given his
word, that he might come in Safety, and those Letters which he alleadged
for his justification, did prove the continuation of his treacherous
designs, seeing that he had sent _la Fin_ and _Hebert_, to _Turin_ and
_Milan_, since the pardon, He could not then expect but Justice, in a
case where neither passion nor favour could alter Judgment: Nevertheless
he shewed himself much satisfied with his answers, and therefore being
come back again to the _Bastille_, he passed the rest of that day, and
the two next, to relate unto his Guards the questions of the Court and
his answers therereunto, counterfeiting the gesture and the words which
he Imagined the Chancellor had spoken after his going away, though that
grave and venerable old man neither said nor did any thing, but what
was becoming to his Age and quality, having shewed himself as full of
compassion, as the prisoner was of his vanity; for when he was nearer to
death he thought less upon it, and thinking himself the only man capable
of commanding an Army, he found some fault in those that were thought
capable of it, saying, that one was unhappy in his undertakings, the
other was not respected by the Souldiers, such a one was a brave man, but
he wanted experience, and another that hath both was a Protestant. To
conclude, he did so please himself with his own praise and deserts, that
he thought no body could come near him, and that he was so useful to the
Kingdom, that it would be a great Crime to think to undo him.

He had spoken so long the 27 of the Month, that there was no time left
to gather the Voices: The Chancellor therefore went into the Palace the
29 following to gather the Voices of the Judges. _Fleury_ the reporter
of the Proces, did conform his opinion to the conclusions of the Kings
Attorney, all the rest agreed to it, either by Words or by Signs, and
all the proofs necessary for the verification of a Crime meeting in this
case, as his Answers, Confessions, Writings, Letters, Instructions, and
Evidence of Witnesses not reproached; It was found, that the unnatural
Conspiracy against the State, the detestable attempt upon the Kings
Person, makes him guilty of high Treason in the first and second degree.

He confesseth he had evil intentions, it is enough, the Laws do punish
the Councels, the resolutions, and the effects; for if the Traitor be not
prevented, time may give him the opportunity to accomplish his Design
and Will, and the Will of a Subject in point of State, doth depend
immediately upon that of the Prince. He sayeth moreover, that without the
Kings Mercy he is undone, and that if he would have put in Execution the
ill designs that were propounded to him against his Majesty, he should
have been gone long ago: Did he ever give notice of them to the King or
to any body else. If the Prisoner had brought to pass his intent, we
might have said, farewell State, farewell Justice, it is too late to
believe the Conspiracy against Princes, when they are murdered by the
Conspirators.

He hath well Served the King, it is true; but his Offices and Dignities
did call him to that Duty, he hath had notable rewards for it, and from
the time that he hath shewed himself so unfaithfull, he hath diminished
the lustre of his deserts. His deserts had made him capable of the first
dignities of the Kingdom, but the merit of them is vanished away, by the
greatness of his Crime.

And what is the State beholding to him, if after he hath contributed
so much for its restauration, he goeth about to turn up side down the
Foundation of it, and to betray it to the Enemies. It is nothing to begin
well unless you end well, the actions are judged by the end: Those that
have deserved best of the States, are the most severely punished when
they fall into Sedition and Rebellion. There is many sheets of Paper in
the Hands of the Court, containing in them one hundred advices given to
the Enemy, the least of which is capable to make him guilty.

The Prisoners quality is not considerable in this case; Justice is blind
to all distinctions, and rather considereth the offence according to
the quality of the offender; Crimes of high Treason are not considered
by things past, but by things present and that are to come; we must not
put in an account what he hath done, but what he had a mind to do. The
quality of a Duke and Peer of _France_, of Knight of the Kings Order, of
Marshal, doth not exempt him from the Law, and from being judged as an
Enemy to the State, and to the Majesty of the Prince, seeing he would
have troubled the State, and attempted upon the Kings person. Who in
_France_ besides is more obliged to the King? the greater then is the
Obligation, the greater the ingratitude. God forbid that the respect of
the quality should stop the course of Justice: a Limb must be cut off to
save all the body.

But his offence hath been forgiven: The pardon cannot extend but to the
things that are confessed; but he acknowledgeth himself that he hath not
told all, therefore he hath confessed as little as he could, his own
confessions Witness, he only asked forgiveness, that he might continue
his Crimes with more security: Besides, he would not acknowledge his
fault to the King, for all the King promised to forgive him, and lately
he told the Court, he did not believe that _la Fin_ had revealed what was
secret between them; and thought he would have kept his word, which he
had confirmed with so many Oaths, and that if he had doubted of it, he
would have cast himself at his Majesties Feet as readily as he, and asked
him forgiveness. It followeth then that there was some thing left behind
that was not confessed: Thus he accuseth himself, thinking to excuse his
fault; besides, he mistaketh himself thinking to persuade the Court,
that since the pardon he hath done nothing amiss, for the Pardon was in
_January_ 1600. and here be Letters of _September_ last, by which he
recalleth _la Fin_, telleth him, he will think no more upon the Vanities
that were past since, God was pleased to have given the King a Dolphin.
It is apparent then that he hath employed _la Fin_ at least since the
Pardon, till the birth of the Dolphin, and _la Fin_ maintaineth that
there was a note quite to the contrary, and that they did continue their
intelligences and practises unknown to the King. That the Duke did recal
him, fearing he should discover the Conspiracy, when a man continues in
his faults and abuseth his Pardon, the last fault payeth for all.

Besides, the Court hath not seen that Pardon, he oughted to have produced
it in writing under the Kings Hand and Seal, and to forgive him once
more, would put him into such a condition, as to contrive always Treasons
against the State; the remedy of a present evil is not to be neglected
upon the hope of an uncertain good; he is in a case to be no more useful;
nothing can be expected from his courage but revenge; he that can bring
no profit by his virtue and faithfulness, must do it by being made an
exemple.

Such were for the most part the reasons of the Court, according to which,
and to the conclusions of the Attorney General, the Chancellor did
pronounce Sentence of death against the Prisoner; some were of opinion
that _la Fin_ should be arrested, as one that could not justifie himself,
for having concealed such a damnable Conspiracy, till he saw that the
_Spanish_ affairs went to wrack. The Chancellor did moderate these
opinions, representing that the Conspiracy was not yet wholly discovered,
and that such things would hinder the rest of those that knew some thing
of it to reveal it; that a man that saveth the Kings Person and his
Estate, ought rather to be rewarded then punished. And in confirmation of
this, the King sent Letters to _la Fin_, by which he assured him, that
such a service done to him and his Kingdom, should never prove his ruine.

The Court stayed onely for the Kings intention upon the execution of the
Sentence, which _Sillery_ had carried to St. _Germain_. The Scaffold was
ready to be set up in the place of _Greve_, but the execution might have
proved dangerous, in the middle of so much people of different humors and
tempers; and already there was a rumour, as if some body should throw
him a Sword, with which he should make himself a passage, or else have
died with a blow less shameful then that of the Hangman; upon his friends
intreaty the execution was ordered to be done in the _Bastille_.

The next day about noon, the people knowing that the Sentence was past,
went some to the _Greve_, thinking that the execution should be done
there, others to St. _Antony_ street, to see the Prisoner pass by; he
saw from his Chamber that multitude, and guessed that he was to be the
Spectacle of those Spectators; here the anguish of the Grave began to
beset him, and drawing a consequence from the shadow of death, that the
body was not far of; he sent _Baranton_ a _Scotish_ Gentleman to intreat
the Marquess of _Rhosny_ to come to see him, or if he could not come, to
sue for his Pardon to the King. He sent him answer, he could do neither,
and that he was extreamly sorry for his misfortune, that if he had
believed him at his coming to Court, he should have confessed what the
King did desire to know of him, for by concealing of it, he did hinder
the King to give him his life, and all his friends to sue for it.

The next day last of _July_ 1602. the Chancellor, the first President,
_Sillery_, three Masters of Requests, some Officers of the Chancery,
_Rapin_ Lieutenant of the short Gown, his Lieutenant, _Daniel Voisin_
Register of the Court of Parliament, six Sergeants, and seven or eight
more went to the Bastille, about ten of the Clock in the morning, as
soon as they were come in the Chancellor commanded that the Prisoners
Dinner should be carryed, without giving him notice of his coming, and
in the mean time he and the first President made a List of those whom
they would have to be present in that action: Some Presidents, three
Masters of Requests, three Auditors, six Serjeants of the Parliament,
the Lieutenant Civil, the Kings Attorney at the _Chastelet_, _Rapin_ and
his Lieutenant, the Knight of the Watch, the Prevost of the Merchants,
four Aldermen, four Councellors of the City, and some few others, to the
number of fifty.

About noon the Prisoner looking through the Grates of his Chamber
Windows, perceived the Wife of _Rumigny_, Captain of the Castle, weeping
with her hands up and guessed that those Tears were drawn by the
compassion of his Fortune. He was confirmed in his opinion, when he saw
the Chancellor followed by the Serjeants, _Rapin_ and his Lieutenant, and
some others go through the _Bastilles_ Yard into the Chappel, then he
began to cry aloud, O my God I am a dead man, ah, what injustice it is to
put an Innocent Person to death, thereupon he intreated _Rumigny_ to tell
his Brothers, Sisters and Kindred, that they should not be ashamed of his
death, because he was Innocent of that he was accused.

The Chancellor commanded he should be brought down into the Chappel,
where as soon as he saw the Chancellor, are you come, said he, to
pronounce me my death: The Chancellor saluted him, then put on his Hat,
the Prisoner stood bare headed, and began to speak first. Ah my Lord
Chancellor, is there no pardon? is there no Mercy? such and such (whom
he did name one after another) have committed such offences and yet have
been pardoned. What? you that look like an honest man, have you suffered
that I should be so miserably condemned? ah! my Lord, if you had not
told the Court that the King would have me to die, they would not have
condemned me so. My Lord, my Lord, you could have hindred that evil, and
you have not done it, you shall answer for that injustice before all the
rest of the Judges that have condemned me, and saying so, he stroke the
Chancellor upon the Arm. Ah! what a great service the King doth this
day to the King of _Spain_, to rid him of such an Enemy as I was, might
I not have been kept within four Walls, till some occasion had offered
where I might have been useful? Ah my Lord, have you forgot my fathers
love to you so much, as not to give notice to the King of what I say,
and what dammage he suffereth in loosing me: I am yet as willing as ever
to do Service to the Kingdom, you could let him know so much, he hath
so good an opinion of you, I am sure he would believe you: A Messenger
could quickly go thither and back again; what shall a thousand Gentlemen
my Kinsmen say? doth he think that after my death they can do him any
service? and what if I had been guilty, would I have come upon those
false assurances that President _Janin_ that great Cheat gave me, when
he told me, that businesses were so ill mannaged in _France_, that it
was fit I should see the King and tell him of it, who at my perswasion
would settle them in better order: I have neglected all the advices of my
friends to hearken unto his perswasions. I have trusted to that cursed
Traitor _la Fin_, who writ to me that I could come in all safety, and
that he had told the King nothing but of the Marriage that was propounded
to me with a daughter of _Savoy_, that the King would receive me with
all kindness. What then? the goings to and fro of many, the reasons
of those who advised me to come, and the Kings Letters, were they all
baits to catch me: I am well served to have trusted to much upon his
Word, I could have sought and got other securities, if I had not trusted
to my Innocency; I am come upon the confidence of my integrity since
his pardon. Ah! doth he not know that he hath forgiven me; I have lied
some evil designs, I have hearkened, I have written, I have spoken, I
confessed them all at _Lyon_, he did assure me never to remember it, and
did exhort me that from hence forwards I should commit nothing that
might compel me to have recourse to his clemency: Nevertheless I am now
accused of things that are blotted out by his pardon; I have not offended
him since, unless it be in that I desired War rather than Peace, because
my humour is not peaceable, had not the King at that time reason to
approve of it? if this Crime deserveth death I fly to his clemency, I
implore his Mercy. The Queen of _England_ told me, that if the Earl of
_Essex_ would have humbled himself, and asked forgiveness, he should have
obtained it: I do, being Innocent, what he would not do being guilty. Ah!
Shall all Mercy be put out for me; those that have done worse have found
Grace and Mercy: I perceive what it is, I am not the more guilty but the
most unhappy, and the King, who hath been so sparing of his Subjects
lives, hath a mind to be prodigal of mine.

To conclude, he forgot nothing of what might be said by a soul pierced
with grief spite, anger, and violent threatning, in exclamations and
revilings against the King and his Parliament, in reproaches against the
Chancellor, that he had more contributed to his condemnation than to his
absolution, in words that are not fit to be spoken nor related.

His words ran so fast that the Chancellor could not stop them:
Nevertheless he took occasion to tell him, his passion suggested him many
things without appearance of reason, and against his own judgment, that
no body had known his defects better than he, and that he could have
wished his faults had been as unknown as dissembled, that the knowledge
of them had been so visible and apparent, that his Judges had more ado
to moderate his punishment than to inflict it. That Sentence was given
upon the proofs of several attemps he had made against the Kings Person
and his Estate, and for having kept intelligence and correspondency with
the Enemies of the Kingdom, of which he had been found guilty, that if he
had concealed the truth in the answers to his accusations, he should now
reveal it being so near to his end, and that for these causes the King
did ask his Order of Knighthood, and his staff of Marshal of _France_,
with which he had formerly honoured him: He pulled the Order out of his
Pocket and put it into the Chancellors hands, Protesting and Swearing
upon the Salvation of his Soul, that he never had broken the Oath he made
in receiving it, that (it is true) he had desired War more than Peace;
because he could not preserve in Peace, the reputation he had got in War,
as for the Staff, he never carryed it: Nevertheless by the Oath that the
Knights of the Holy Ghost take, they are bound to take no Pension, Wages
nor Money from forrain Princes, and to engage themselves in no bodies
service but the Kings, and faithfully to reveal what they shall know to
be for or against the Kings service.

After that the Chancellor exhorted him to lift up his thoughts from Earth
to Heaven, to call upon God, and to hear patiently his Sentence.

My Lord (said he) I beseech you do not use me as other men; I know what
my Sentence beareth, my accusations are false, I wonder the Court would
Condemn me upon the Evidence of the most wicked and detestable man that
is alive; he never came near me without Witchcraft, nor never went from
me till he had bewitched me, he did bite my left ear off, and made me
drink inchanted waters, and when he said, that the King had a mind to rid
himself of me, he called me his King, his Benefactor, his Prince, his
Lord, he hath communication with the Devils, and hath shewed me a Wax
Image, speaking these words in Latine, _Rex impie morieris_, ungodly King
thou shalt die. If he hath had so much power by his Magick, as to make
an inanimate body to speak, it is no wonder that he should make my Will
conformable to his.

Here the Chancellor stopt him, and told him, that the Court had well
considered his answers, and his Letters, that he ought not to find fault
with his Sentence, that it had done him the same justice as a Father
should do to his son, if he had offended in the like manner. He had
scarce spoken these words when the other answered, what Judgment? I
have been heard but once, and had no time to tell the fiftieth part of
my justification; if I had been heard at large, I could have made it
clearly appear that _la Fin_ is such a one as I say; what Judgment upon
the Evidence of a Bougerer? of a Rogue that hath forsaken his Wife, of
a treacherous and perfidious man, that had Sworn so many times upon the
Holy Sacrament, never to reveal what was between us, of a Knave that
hath so often counterfeited my Hand and Seal: It is true, I have written
some of those Letters that were shewed me, but I never intended to put
them in Execution: and the rest are falsified: Is there not many that
can counterfeit so well the Hand and Seal of others, that themselves can
scarce distinguish them. It is well known that the Lady _Marchioness_
of _Vernevil_ hath lately acknowledged that to be her own hand, which
she had never written. My Heart and my Actions have sufficiently
countervailed the faults of my Hand, and of my Tongue. Besides, the King
hath forgiven me, I do implore his Memory for a Witness. You say I have
been found guilty to have attempted upon the Kings Person; that is false,
that never came into my mind, and I knew nothing of it till that _la Fin_
did propose it to me before St. _Katherines_ Fort, six or seven days
after the Siege, if I had been thus minded, I could have easily brought
it to pass; I was the only man that hindred the King to go before the
Fort: If my services had been taken into consideration, I should not have
been thus condemned: I believe that if you had not been present, the
Parliament would not have judged me so rigorously; I wonder that you,
whom I thought to be prudent and wise, have used me so cruelly; it would
have been more honourable for your quality and old age to implore for me
the Kings Mercy, than his Justice. There is Dungeons here where I might
have been kept bound hand and foot; I should have at last that comfort to
pray for those who should have got me that favour from the King. If I had
been but a single Souldier, I should have been sent to the Galleys; but
because I am a Marshal of _France_, I am thought to be as dangerous a man
to the State, as I have been useful heretofore. My life is sought after,
I see there is no Mercy for me; the King hath often forgiven those,
who not only intended to do evil, but had done it; this Vertue is now
forgotten, he giveth occasion now to the World to believe, that he never
used clemency or forgiveness, but when he was afraid. I was of opinion,
that if I had killed one of his Children he would have forgiven me. Is it
not pity that my Father should have run so many dangers, and at last died
in the field to keep the Crown upon his Head, and that now he should take
my head off my Shoulders, is it possible he should forget the services I
have done him? doth he not remember the conspiracy of _Mantes_, and the
dangers he should have been in if I had taken the Conspirators part? Hath
he forgotten the Siege of _Amiens_, where I have been so often among the
fire and Bullets, neglecting my own life to preserve his, I have not a
Vein but hath been open to preserve his own Blood, I have received five
and thirty wounds to save his life; he sheweth now that he never loved me
but when he had need of me, he taketh away my head, but let him beware
that the Justice of God doth not fall upon his. My Blood shall cry for
revenge for the wrong that is done me to day, I call the King of _Spain_
and the Duke of _Savoy_ to Witness, if I know any thing what is laid to
my charge. _La Fin_ himself did shew me sometimes a Catholick List of
about fourscore Gentlemen, who received Pension from the King of _Spain_,
I had never so much curiosity as to read it; let him be put to the rack
he shall tell many particularities of it; the King within a little while
shall perceive what he getteth by my death; I shall at last die a good
Catholick, and constant in my Religion, I believe that’s the cause of my
death.

The Chancellor seeing that all his discourses were full of passion,
vanity and repetitions, and void of reason, and were like an impetuous
Torrent that cannot be stopt, and that all his words were nothing but
reproaches against the King and the Court of Parliament, blasphemies
against God, and execrations against his Accusers; said that his business
called him away, and that in his absence he would leave him two Divines
to comfort him, and to dispose his soul to leave quietly this World, for
the enjoying of a better.

As the Chancellor was going out, the Prisoner begged of him that he might
have the liberty to make his Will, because he did owe much, and much
was owing to him, and he desired to satisfie every body. The Chancellor
answered, that the Recorder _Voisin_ should stay with him to write his
Will under the Kings good pleasure. And as the Chancellor spoke to
_Voisin_, the Prisoner turning to _Roissy_, Master of Requests, asked him
if he were, one of those that had condemned him: my Father hath loved
you so much, that though you were one, yet should I forgive you. _Roissy_
answered, my Lord, I pray God Almighty to comfort you.

They went out, and he with a quiet mind and free from passion, did
dictate his Will in what form he would, with the same _Garbe_, as if he
had been making a Speech at the head of an Army; he remembred his friends
and servants, and did not forget the Baron of _Lux_, whom he loved above
all the rest. He lest eight hundred Livers a year to a Bastard of his,
whom he begot of a woman that he left with Child of another, to which
child he left a Mannor near _Dijon_ that had cost him six thousand
Crowns, he disposed all the rest of his Debts, and answered modestly, and
without confusion to all the Notes and Bills that were brought him about
his affairs. Took three Rings off his fingers, and intreated _Baranton_
to give them to his Sisters, two to the Countess of _Roussy_, and the
other to that of Saint _Blancard_, desiring they would wear them for
his sake; he distributed in Alms about 200. Crowns that he had in his
Pocket, fifty to the _Capuchines_, fifty to the _Fueillants_, fifty to
the _Minimes_, and the rest to several poor people.

The Will being made, the Recorder put him in mind how my Lord Chancellor
had told him he was condemned to death, and that according to the
ordinary forms of the Law, he must have his Sentence read to him; that
this action required humility, therefore willed him to kneel before the
Altar, leaving off hence forth all thoughts of this World, to think upon
the Father of Mercies; he kneeled with the right knee upon the first step
of the Altar, and heard it read as followeth:

    _Seen by the Court, the Chambers being assembled together,
    the Process extraordinarily made by the Presidents and
    Councellors, appointed by the King under his Letters Patents,
    dated the 18 and 19 of ~June~, at the request of the Kings
    Sollicitor General, against the Lord ~Charles~ of ~Gontault~
    of ~Biron~, Knight of both Orders, Duke of ~Biron~, Peer and
    Marshal of ~France~, Governour of ~Burgundy~, Prisoner in the
    Castle of ~Bastille~, accused of high Treason, Informations,
    Interrogations, Confessions and denials, Confrontations, and
    Witnesses, Letters, Advices, and Instructions given to the
    Enemies, and acknowledged by him, and all what the Solliciter
    General hath produced. Sentence of the 22 of this Month, by
    which it was ordered, that in the absence of the Peers of
    ~France~ summoned, it should be further proceeded to Judgment
    Conclusions of the Kings Sollicitor, the accuser being heard
    and interrogated, all things being duly considered, hath been
    concluded, that the said Court hath declared, and declareth the
    said Duke of ~Biron~, attainted and convicted of high Treason,
    for the conspiracies by him made against the Kings Person and
    Estates, Proditions and Treaties with his Enemies, when he
    was Marshal of the Army of the said King, for reparation of
    which Crime, the said Court hath deprived and depriveth him
    of all his Estates, Honours and Dignities, and hath condemned
    and condemneth him to be beheaded upon a Scaffold, which for
    that purpose shall be erected in the place of ~Greve~, hath
    declared, and declareth, all and every one of his Goods,
    moveable or unmoveable, in whatsoever places scituated and
    seated, to be acquired and confiscated to the King, the Mannor
    of ~Biron~, deprived for ever of the Title and Dukedom and
    Peerage, and altogether all his other Goods, immediately holden
    from the King, reunited to the Crown again. Done in Parliament
    the last day of ~July 1602~. Signed in the Original by ~de
    Belieure~, Chancellor of ~France~, Councillor in the Court,
    Reporter of the Process._

He was not moved at these words, _attainted and convicted of high
Treason_, but at these, _against the Person of the King_, he fell into
a rage, and Swearing as he had done many times before, and shall do
hereafter with great Oaths and Imprecations, there is no such thing, said
he to the Recorder, it is false, blot out that; he was also very angry,
hearing that he was to be executed in the place of _Greve_, thinking that
for several respects he was to be distinguished from the common sort of
people, and Swore again, that he would not go thither, and that he had
rather to be torn in pieces by wild Horses, and that it was not in the
power of all those that stood by to carry him thither, then he was a
little appeased, when _Voisin_ told him, that the King had done him that
favour to change the place of Execution, and that it was to be done in
the _Bastille_. The confiscation of his Goods, and the revenues of the
Dukedom of _Biron_ to the Crown, was the last point of the Sentence that
vexed him. What? said he, doth the King intend to grow rich out of my
poverty? The Lordship of _Biron_ cannot be confiscated, I only possessed
it by substitution of my Brethren, what shall my Brethren do, the King
ought to have been satisfied with the loss of my life.

The Sentence being pronounced, _Voisin_ did exhort him again to renounce
all the vanities of the world, to take no other care but of the
Salvation of his Soul, which was to be first by reconciling himself to
God Almighty, and that there was two Divines for that purpose, and that
according to the usual forms of Executions, he would be pleased to suffer
himself to be bound. That word of Execution did seem so horrid to him,
that he fell into a new rage, Swearing, that he would never permit so
infamous a person to touch him, otherwise than with the Sword, and that
he had rather be hewen in pieces. To keep him from falling into a further
despair, _Voisin_ left him, with his Divines, _viz._ _Garnier Almonec_,
and Confessor to the King, and after that Bishop of _Montpelier_, and
_Magnan_, Curate of St. _Nicolas_ in the fields at _Paris_, who began
to talk boldly to him of his death, and to disvest himself of all his
thoughts, as he had done of his Goods, and to take no other care than
that of his Soul, whereupon he fell into a passion again, Let me alone
(said he) it is I that must think upon my Soul, you have nothing to do
with it, I had no need of you, you shall not be troubled to hear my
confession; what I speak aloud is my confession, I have been these eight
days a confessing my self, and the last night, me thought I saw the
Heavens opened, and that God lent me his Hand; my Keepers heard me laugh
for joy in my sleep. The Divines did not loose Courage for all that, but
more and more intreated him to consider, that he was no more what he had
been before, that within one or two hours he should be no more, that he
must change to be for evermore, that his Soul was ready to appear before
the fearfull Throne of the living God, to be rewarded with a more happy
life than that he had hitherto passed; or be condemned to an Eternal
pain and that in comparison of that which he was to suffer now, it was
no more than the slight pricking of a Pin, and having in some measure
appeased him, they left him to examine his Conscience, while _Voisin_
went to give notice of his refusing to be bound; the Chancellor doubted
whether he should be compelled to it; the first President said, that it
was dangerous to let him loose; _Sillery_ having learned of _Voisin_ that
the Prisoner was at that time very quiet, said, that if they went about
to bind him, he would break all the bonds of Patience, and should never
be brought to Execution but in a rage and dispair; according to that
opinion he was left free in his body, that he might be the more free in
his thoughts.

Which were more to the World, and to the setling of his affairs, than to
the saving of his Soul, which he had neglected all his life time, and
shewed himself utterly ignorant of the principles of his Religion, for
which he said a little before, he was put to death, and those that were
present related, that his Prayers made him appear more a Souldier than a
Christian; he prayed in commanding, and commanded in praying.

His Confession being ended, he walked in the Chappel with one hand upon
his side, and with the other holding the strings of his Shirt, did
unbutton and button again his Doublet. _Voisin_ being come back told
him, that the Chancellor and the first President were very glad to hear
of his Patience, and of his constant resolution to die. He talked much
of the Money he had at _Dijon_, of the worth of his Jewels, and of what
was owing to him, and what himself did owe, he desired that some Sums of
Money should be paid to certain Gentlemen, that had no Obligation for it:
But still he broke forth into exclamations concerning his Innocency, and
execrations against _la Fin_, asking if it should not be lawfull for his
Brothers to prosecute him, and to cause him to be burnt.

Upon this, those that kept him during his Imprisonment, came to take
their leave of him, every one having his left hand upon the handle of his
Sword, and Tears in his Eyes, he moved them to compassion by the sight of
his present condition, and exhorted them to serve the King faithfully,
against whom he had said he had done nothing amiss, and complained that
he could find no Mercy at his Hands, intreated them to pray to God for
him, and to oblige them to that, distributed among them all his Cloaths
and linnen, and Watches; he desired also the Knight of the Watch to tell
the King, that his Servants knew nothing of his Affairs, that the Earl of
_Auvergne_ was not to be questioned upon that account: He intreated much
one exempt of the Guards to go to the said Earl, and tell him he had laid
nothing to his charge, and that he went to die without any grief, but of
the loss of his friendship, and that the shortness of his life would not
give him leave to shew in effect how much he was his servant. The Earl
sent him word, that he did accept of his farewell, as of an intimate
friend; and that he remained behind to lament all the days of his life
the loss he suffered in him, intreated him to leave him his Bastard Son,
to have him brought up with his own Children. After this the Prisoner saw
a Gentleman belonging to the Duke of _Mayene_, and entreated him to tell
his Master, that if ever in his life he had given him some occasion not
to love him, that he prayed to believe that he would die his servant, as
also of the Duke of _Aiguillon_, and Earl of _Sommerive_ his Children; he
likewise intreated _Arnaut_, Secretary to the Marquess of _Rhosny_, to
remember his last commendations to his Master, and desire him to remember
not so much him that went to die, as his Brethren whom he left behind,
that he had him in opinion of a good and usefull servant to the King, and
repented much he had not believed his Councel.

About three of the Clock the Chancellor and the first President went
up again into the Chappel, and finding him in a good disposition, did
fortifie his resolution by their discourses, and desiring to know more
particularities from his own mouth, sent all the standers by away, except
the Divines and the Recorder: They did exhort him to consider, that the
days of man are limited, that the end of his days depended from the
Providence of the Almighty, who would take him out of this world before
some great and long misery should make him weary of it. He answered, no,
no my Lords, do not trouble you about comforting me and strengthning me
against the fear of death, I have not been afraid of it these 20 years;
you have given me 40 days to study it, but I could not believe that
having not been in the power of my Enemies to take away my life, I should
be so miserable as to loose it by the consent of my friends; having said
this they left him, and took their leaves of him with Tears in their
Eyes, he would not suffer them to depart till they had received a new
Protestation of his, that he never had attempted any thing against the
King, Swearing, that if he would have done it, the King should not have
been alive three years ago.

As they were going out of the _Bastille_ with _Sillery_, he sent the
Knight of the Watch to intreat the Chancellor, that his Body might be
buried at _Biron_, in the Sepulchre of his Ancestors, and that he would
desire the King to give to his younger Brother some Office in the house
of the _Dolphin_, and shewing by his Countenance, Carryage, and Words, to
care as little for death as one that is a great way from it gave cause to
suspect, that he was not out of hope to obtain his pardon from the King,
or to escape by some extraordinary means.

The Divines did exhort him to keep nothing back of what might serve for
the discharging of his Conscience, and to consider, that they could give
him absolution for no more than what he did confess. Although, said he,
the King causeth me to die unjustly, nevertheless I have served him with
so much affection and obedience, and I have near my death so much good
will and affection for him, that if I knew any thing against his Person
or State, I would tell it freely, and upon that whispered some things to
his Confessors, which _Voisin_ did presently write.

Being about five of the Clock, _Baranton_ was sent to tell him it was
time to go; let us go said he, seeing I must die, and desired he would
charge his Brothers from him, to remain faithful to the King, and not to
go to Court, till time had blotted, or at least lessened the shame of
his death. He kneeled before the Altar, and having ended his Prayer, he
desired the Company to pray for him.

Coming out of the Chappel, he met the Executioner, who offered to follow
him, and he thinking it was to bind him; keep off, (said he) and do not
touch me till it be time; I shall go willingly to die without troubling
any body; but it shall never be said that I am dead like a Slave, or
a Thief, and swore by God that if he came near him he would strangle
him. The Divines exhorted him going down the stairs to resist those
impaciencies and temptations of the Devil, who striveth most to deviate
the Soul from her Salvation, when as he hath most need of the Divine
assistance to withstand his assaults, remonstrating also unto him, that
all his violences and passions could not hinder the Soul to depart from
a place where she was but a Tenant at Will. He hearkened to them, and
saying three times ah, ah, ah, raising his voice at every one, he said,
is there no Mercy in the world, I see to day, that all the world hath
forsaken me.

He came into the Yard, and seeing the Lieutenant of the City, in whose
house the King had put _la Fin_, to secure him from all attempts, My Lord
Lieutenant (said he) I am very much your friend, take heed to have any
thing to do with that Witch and Magician that lyeth at your house, if you
meddle with him he will undo you.

The Scaffold was set up in the corner of the Yard, over against the
Garden gate, six foot high, and seven long, without any Ornament or
distinction. He kneeled upon the first step, lifted up his Eyes to Heaven
and made a short Prayer, like a Souldier, and went up as couragiously
as if he had gone to an assault, clad in a Gray Taffety Suit, with a
black Hat on his Head, but as soon as he saw the Executioner, he looked
furiously upon him, and bid him stand aside till he were ready to receive
the last stroke: He threw his Hat, his Handkarchief, and Doublet to the
first that would take it, nevertheless one of the Executioners men was
nimbler than all the rest, and looking upon the Souldiers that kept the
Gate armed, with Musquets and Fire-locks. Ah! said he, must I die? is
there no pardon? if at least some of those good fellows would shut me
(opening his Breast) he should oblige my very much, what pity is it to
die so miserably, and of so shameful a blow, then directing his speech
to the Spectators, he said, I have put my Soul into such a state as she
ought to be to appear before the face of Almighty God, but I pity that
of the King, who causeth me to die unjustly: I have erred I confess,
but I never attempted anything against the Kings Person, he should have
been dead ten years ago if I would have believed the evil Councel that
was given me concerning that the trouble and distress of his Soul was so
great, that a little while before he said three years, and now he says
ten; the Divines having setled him a little once more, he received their
absolution.

The Executioner then presented unto him a Frontlet, but it proved to him
a new wound, an increase of grief, and swore if he toucht him any other
way than with the Sword he would strangle him, & thereupon he asked
again for his own Handkarchief to make use of it, his hollow and gastly
Eyes shewed he was not in his right mind. _Voisin_ intreated him to be
patient, and to raise his thoughts to the place where his Soul was to go,
and to be attentive to the reading of his Sentence. He was unwilling to
hear the repetition of his Crimes, and to have occasion to exclaim again
against the Iniquitie, of those that had condemned him, against the Kings
cruelty, as he called it, that would not grant him his pardon, and that
this was to make him feel death before death. _Voisin_ answered, that it
could not be done otherwise. He answered that every body knew for what
reason he was there and then as if it were by confession, he said, _well,
read_, and thereupon held his Peace till _Voisin_ came to these words,
_for having attempted against the Kings Person_; for then he fell into a
passion again, as he had done before, and said, that it was false, that
this never came into his mind, that as God was his Judge, he would be for
ever deprived of his Grace if it were true, that since two and twenty
Months he had done nothing against the Kings service, that it is true he
had written some Letters, but that the King had forgiven him, protesting
and calling the Spectators to Witness, that it was the truth what he
spoke, as he would answer it before God, and spoke so many words, and so
fast that neither he nor the Sheriff could be understood.

The Sentence being read, the Divines did admonish him to leave all
Earthly thoughts, to implore the assistance of Heaven, and to resign his
Soul to the Eternal providence of the Almighty, and his Body to what the
Law had ordained of it, he made some Prayer to God, and bound his Eyes
with his own Handkarchief, and asked the Executioner in what place he was
to put himself, the Executioner pointing with his finger, said, there
my Lord; he pulled off his Handkarchief in a rage, and where is that
there, said he? thou seest I am blind fold, and thou shewest me as if I
could see; he bound himself again, and bid the Executioner to dispatch
quickly: The Executioner told him he ought to kneel, for fear he should
do something amiss. No, no, said he, I shall not stir, if thou canst not
do it at one blow do it at thirty, he was intreated again to kneel, which
he did, and spoke these Imperious words, dispatch, dispatch, then rose
up again, and untied his Handkarchief, and by casting his Eyes upon the
Executioner, made the people believe, that either he had a mind to seize
upon the Sword, or that he was terribly afrighted by the approaches of
Death, and began again his former complaints, is there no pardon? must
I die so miserably? after so many services. The Executioner intreated
him to suffer his hairs behind to be cut off; he began to swear again
fearfully, that if he toucht him otherwise than with the Sword, he would
strangle him. The Divines told him that he was too carefull of his Body,
he would hear no more of that, but fell into a rage, and swore, that he
would not be toucht by so Infamous a Person as long as he was alive, that
if they did provoke him too much, he would strangle half the Company, and
oblige the other half to kill him, those that were upon the Scaffold went
down and left him with the Executioner, who repented himself heartily
that he had taken the care of him unbound.

The Divines went up again upon the Scaffold, and desired him for the
love of God to resolve to step over that pass, which was necessary for
every man to do, and with some few other words, whispered into his ears,
did calm him a little, and made him resolve to undergo the Execution,
after he had made many complaints, and shewed great fears of dying. A
strange thing that as stout and valiant a man as ever was born, who had
so many times cast himself amongst the greatest dangers, without any fear
or apprehension, as if there was no death for him, should shew himself
now so fearful at the coming of it; we may judge by this, that the
apprehension of death is incomparably greater when it cometh upon a cold
blood, and those that know what his Chirurgion was wont to say, shall
less wonder at it; for he said, that the Duke of _Biron_ used to wonder
at himself, that being not afraid of the thrust of a Sword, nevertheless
he was very timerous at the pricking of a Launcet, when he had occasion
to be let blood: Whereupon we must confess, that the greatest courage,
and most undaunted stoutness of a man, is nothing in comparison of human
Natures weakness.

The Divines judging him to be out of fear, gave him his last absolution,
he kneeled again, and cried aloud three times, _My God, my God, my
God, have Mercy upon me_, then turning to the Executioner, he took the
headband that he had in his hand, and intreated _Baranton_ to do him
that last curtesie as to lift up his hairs behind, which _Baranton_
did, and the Duke himself did tie the Handkarchief about his Eyes. The
Divines seeing him in that good disposition, did assure him, that he
was ready to go to Heaven, and to see God, and to enjoy his Glory. Yes,
said he, Heaven is open to receive my Soul, and so stooped his neck for
the Executioner to do his office. The Executioner considering, that he
had untied himself three times before, and might do so again for the
fourth, thought fitting to entertain him with fair words, to desire his
forgiveness, and to put him in mind of saying his last Prayer, in the
mean time he beckened to his man, who was at the foot of the Scaffold,
to reach him the Sword, which no sooner was in his hand, but the Duke of
_Birons_ Head was off his Shoulders, it fell from the Scaffold to the
ground, and was thrown again by the Executioners man upon the Scaffold,
the Body was stript to its Shirt, and wraped in a Sheet, and the same day
buried, about nine of the Clock at night, in St. _Pauls_ Church, without
any shew or Ceremony. Thus ended the Tragical History of the Duke of
_Biron_.

Now follows the two last Verses of this Prophecie.

    _A Post overtaken in the Countrey,_
    _And the Scrivener shall cast himself into the Water._

Which as we have said before, were concerning _Nicolas L’oste_, Secretary
to the Lord _Villeroy_, chief Secretary of State. The History therefore
is thus.

The _French_ Embassador at _Madrid_, complained once to _Henry_ the
IV. he was so ill informed, and so late of Affairs, that the King of
_Spain_’s Ministers knew them before him: The King was a great while
troubled before he could discover the spring of that infidelity, at last
it came out in this manner. _Villeroy_ that great Oracle of _France_,
and the most confident Secretary to the King, had among his servants
one _Nicolas l’Oste_, born at _Orleans_, in whom he did confide so much
the more, because his Father had been the most part of his life in his
service.

The Lord _Rochepot_ going Embassador into _Spain_, _Oste_ desired to be
admitted into his Family, to serve him as his secretary, that he might
the better fit himself for publick employment. _Villeroy_’s commendation
got him easily that employment, by which in a few Months he became so
capable of the _Spanish_ Tongue and manners, that no body could have
distinguished him from a natural _Spaniard_. The Embassador having sworn
in the name of the most Christian King the treaty of Peace made at
_Veruins_, the King of _Spain_ presented him with a rich Chain of Jewels,
and with six other of Gold, valued at 150. Crowns apiece, to bestow upon
as many of his own servants as he should think fit.

The pride and presumption of this young man was such as to perswade him
he deserved one of them, and chiefly because one of his fellows was
thought worthy of it, but his Master did not think so, and thus he was
neglected.

Thus envy and jealousie were the Windows by which the Devil crept into
his soul; the vanity, lying, pride, and debauchery gave him a full
admittance, he had spent all his Money to buy the love of a Courtisane,
and wanted means to follow that course which he had no mind to leave off.
His Masters neglecting of him, had extraordinarily vexed him, but he
comforted himself that he knew his secrets, and that in revealing them to
the King of _Spains_ Ministers he shot two Birds with one shot; for he
should avenge himself of that contempt he had received, and should have a
way to continue his amorous expences. With that intention he made himself
known to _Don Franchese_ one of the Secretaries of State, and told him
what means he had to serve the King of _Spain_, and to shew him proofs of
that service and affection he had vowed to him long before, by imparting
to him all the Letters that the Embassador did both send and receive from
the King his Master.

_Don Franchese_ heard this proposition as from a young man, whose Brains
were not well settled, or perhaps did abhor such infidelity, therefore
told him coldly, that the Catholick King was in so good amity with the
most Christian one, that he desired to know no more of his business, than
what his Embassador should tell him.

L’_Oste_ did not despond for all this, but went to _Don Ydiaques_ another
Secretary of State, who knowing how important it is for a Prince to know
the secrets of his Neighbours, and that the slighting of such an offer
would be prejudicial to the King his Masters Service, did hearken unto
this Traitor, approved of his design, and exhorted him to persevere in
the good affection he shewed to the King of _Spains_ service, promised to
acquaint the King with it, and to procure him such a reward, as he should
have reason to be satisfied with.

The Councel agreed that L’_Oste_ should be incouraged, and _Don
Ydiaques_, presented him to the Duke of _Lerma_, to whom he shewed
the Alphabet of Cyphers, with which his Master writ his Letters into
_France_, and for a further proof unciphered the last Letter that the
King of _France_ had sent. The Duke exhorted him to continue his good
Will, gave him 1200. Crowns for an earnest of the Bargain, with a promise
of as much for a yearly pension, besides a considerable gratification he
was to expect from the King.

Since that time the _French_ Embassador received no Letters but they
were presently imparted to the _Spanish_ Councel: But the Lord _la
Rochepot_ being called back into _France_, L’_Oste_ lost the conveniency
of prosecuting his Treasons, and consequently the hopes of his promised
reward, therefore sought means to come again into his first Masters,
that is, _Villeroy_’s service, but he was a while kept back from it by
reason of a difference between his Mother and _Villeroy_, about some
rest of Accounts; but L’_Oste_ had rather take that loss upon him than
to be deprived of that occasion. The Embassador himself gave him a large
Testimony Of his ability and faithfulness, and was Instrumental for his
re-admission into that service.

Thus being re-established, he became more diligent and sedulous than ever
before, and not only writ more Letters than any of his fellows, but also
offered them his service to help them, that he might have a more perfect
knowledge of all transactions, and so impart them to the _Spaniard_,
and so visited and conferred with _Taxis_ the _Spanish_ Embassador at
_Paris_, and after that with his successor, _Don Baltazar de Cuniga_,
with so much cunning and secrecy, that the Councel of _Spain_ received
his Letters, before _des Barreaux_ the _French_ Embassador at _Madrid_,
could receive those of the King.

_Des Barreaux_ sent word to the King, that when he propounded any thing,
according to his Majesties command, to the Councel of _Spain_, he found
them always preadvised, and could not find out by what means; certainly
said the King, there must be some in my Councel that keep a strict
intelligence with the _Spaniard_, and I can not tell whom to suspect.
Providence doth often draw good effects out of the worse causes, and
permitteth that the wicked should disclose one anothers wickedness, as
a Nail driveth out another. _Loste_ had revealed himself familiarly to
one _Raffis_, formerly Secretary to the Lord _Lansac_, a fugitive into
_Spain_, for many Treasons, and exempted from pardon; but the _Spaniard_
had begun to cut him short of his former Pensions, since the Treason of
the Baron of _Fontanelles_, Governour of _Dornavenest_ in _Brittanny_,
in which the said _Raffis_ had been a principal Actor, though in vain,
so that since, the Councel of _Spain_ looked upon him as an unprofitable
servant, and withdrew their Pension.

_Raffis_ finding himself near a great want and misery, thought this
occasion might be a means to prevent it, and to procure his return into
his native Countrey, by doing so great a service to his Prince; therefore
he went to one of the _French_ Embassadors most faithful servants, and
told him his grief, for having had a share in so many Treasons and
Rebellions in _France_, which he acknowledged God had into his particular
protection, that he was resolved to blot out the memory of them by a
notable service done to the King and Kingdom, but that could not be,
unless he had first obtained pardon for all his former misdemeanors.

This being told to the Embassadour, he heard _Raffis_, who told him in
general that the King was betrayed, and his most secret Councel bewrayed,
but that he could not name the Traitor, no not to his Majesty himself,
before he had his pardon: that being done, he would wholly withdraw
himself from those whom he knew certainly to be enemies to the Kingdom.
The Embassadour sent an express to the King to give him notice of it. The
King sent him full power to treat with _Raffis_, with promiss to ratifie
whatsoever he should promiss to _Raffis_; _Raffis_ could not make good
his accusation, but by two Letters written by _Loste_, to a great friend
of his, named _Blas_, which Letters he knew to be in a Box of _Blas_,
who lodged with him; therefore upon some pretext or another, they found
means to send _Blas_ as far as l’_Escurial_. In his absence _Raffis_ and
_Descardes_ Secretary to the Embassadour, broke open the Box, and took
out the Letters, by which _Loste_ did much magnifie the liberalities of
_Spain_, as being above his desert and expectation; with this proofs
and the Embassadors Letters, _Raffis_ fained to go to a Monastery near
_Madrid_, and there make his devotions upon Palm-Sunday, as he was wont
to do, but he went directly to _Bayone_, where he met with _Discardes_
upon a set day. _Blas_ came back after Palm-Sunday, and finding his Box
open, and his companion run away, he suspected the matter, and gave
notice of it to the _Spanish_ Ministers, who presently dispatched two
Courriers to the _Spanish_ Embassador at _Paris_, to give him notice
that a man was gone from _Madrid_; who would discover _Loste_ and his
practises, therefore he should give him notice of it, and bid him look to
himself, and that in case he should be taken, to keep secresie.

_Descardes_ and _Raffis_ came to _Paris_ the _Wensday_ after Easter, and
carried themselves with all faithfulness in this occasion, but not with
all the prudence that could have been desired. _Villeroy_ was going the
same day to lie at his own House, between _Paris_ and _Fountain-bleau_,
where the Court was then; they met with him at _Juvisy_, and waited on
him as far as _Villeroy_, but told him nothing of the occasion of their
coming by the way, till they presented him with the Embassadors Letters,
which was a notable fault, for he would certainly have neglected all
other business to secure his man, who was then doing his devotions at the
Charter-house of _Paris_.

The next day _Villeroy_ was the first that told the King of the coming of
_Raffis_, and of the perfidiousness of his own servant. As he was going
back to his Lodging, notice was given him that two _Spanish_ Courtiers
were arrived at the Post-house; he commanded one of the Commissioners
of the Post-house, that he should cause them to withdraw into a Room,
and that no body should speak with them; he charged also _Descardes_,
that he should spy the coming of _Loste_, that he should keep him close
company, and send him presently notice of his arrival. The Commissioner
and _Descardes_ did commit here another great fault, for _Loste_ being
come to the Post-house about noon, this silly Commissioner told him that
there were arrived two _Spanish_ Courtiers who asked for him, that they
had Letters for him, and more then that, suffered him to go into their
Chamber and see them, he saluted them, and one of them whispered him in
the ear that he was undone if he did not save himself presently, and
that _Raffis_ had discovered him; fear and astonishment with his guilty
conscience, persuaded him easily to look to himself.

Nevertheless, he settled his countenance the best he could, he went out
with an intention to take his Horse again, which he had sent before, and
so save himself; _Descardes_ and _Raffis_ perceived him, _Descardes_ came
and saluted him, and thinking perhaps that he was strong enough to give
an account of him, neglected to send word to _Villeroy_, who was then
in his Closet with the Bishop of _Chartres_; _Descardes_ presence was a
great thorn in _Loste_’s foot, to be rid of him, he said he was going to
his Master, who stayed for him; _Descardes_ offered to accompany him: he
answered, he had not dined, and that believing it was past Dinner time
at home, he would go into some Cabaret to look for a Dinner, the other
answered I have not dinned neither, we shall dine together. _Loste_ found
another excuse, and said my Boots hurt me, I pray give me leave that
I may go and pull them off; _Descardes_ answered, he must needs drink
with him. Thus arguing together, they came to _Villeroy_’s Lodging,
where _Descardes_ thinking to have him sure, left him in the Room, not
knowing that the _Spanish_ Courtiers had talked with him, and came near
the Closet to give notice of it to _Villeroy_; but as soon as he saw
himself rid of _Descardes_, he went down into the Stable, and finding
his Horse yet Sadled he Mounted, and with all speed rid to _Paris_;
_Villeroy_ in the mean time having notice that his man was come, he
commanded they should bring them in; but he was not to be found, nor his
Horse neither, no body knowing which way he was gone. _Villeroy_ told
the King that his man was escaped, they sent after him on all sides, and
_Villeroy_ particularly sent all his Servants after into all the ways.
_Loste_ coming to _Paris_ about nine of the Clock at night, went to take
counsel of the _Spanish_ Embassadour, and before day, went out habited
like a _Spaniard_, with the Embassadors Steward, and took his way towards
_Meaux_, with an intent to get into _Luxembourg_ by Poste.

That every one might endeavour the apprehending of that Traitor, it was
spread abroad that one of _Villeroy_’s Secretaries had attempted upon
the Kings Person, and notice was given of his Stature, Age, Cloaths and
Horse. The Sheriffs of every Countrey were in quest, and all Post-Masters
were forbidden to let out any Horses, but that of _Meaux_ had notice
of it too late; _Loste_ was got on Horseback already, but assoon as he
began to gallop, his Horse fell to the ground, and was an ill _Omen_
to the Rider; he got up again, and shewed so much fearfulness in his
Countenance, that the Postillion himself thought he had committed some
notorious villany, which he did run for. Being come home, he gave
notice of it to his Master, who suspecting him to be the man enquired
off, he gave notice of it to the Sheriff, who presently made after him
at the second Ferry of _la Ferte soubs Jouare_, where he was Crossing
the River; the Sheriff cried after the Ferry man to come back, but
the fear of his life, which the two run aways put him into, prevailed
upon him, above the Sheriffs commands, being got over, and judging that
their Post-Horses should be quickly overtaken by those of the Sheriff,
they forsook them and the Postillion; and trusted to their heels in the
darkness of the night among the Bushes and Brambles that are upon the
River _Marne_. The Sheriff scattered his men all about, caused fires to
be made, and raised up all the Countrey people thereabout; the _Spaniard_
ran over the Champion Countrey, and _Loste_ went from Bush to Bush, and
whether accidentally or wilfully he fell into the River _Marne_, where he
was drowned; the next day his Hat was found between two posts, and his
body two days after not far from that place.

Thus you may plainly see the full event of those two famous Prophecies,
contained in this sixth Stanza.


VII.

    French.

    La Sangsue au Loup se joindra,
    Lors qu’en Mer le bled defaudra,
    Mais le grand Prince sans envie,
    Par Ambassade luy donra,
    De son bled pour luy donner vie,
    Pour un besoing s’en pourvoira.

    English.

    The Leech will joyn it self to the Wolf,
    When in the Sea Corn shall be wanting,
    But the great Prince without envy,
    By Embassy shall give him,
    Of his Corn to give him life,
    Of which in his need he shall make provision.

ANNOT.

By the _Leech_ is understood the _Spaniard_. By the _Wolf_ is meant the
_French_, by reason of the multitude of those Creatures in that Kingdom;
the meaning therefore of this Prophecy is, that there should be a great
famine in _Spain_, wherein the _Spaniard_ should be constrained to
make his application to the _French_ for relief of Corn, which should
be granted him. This happened in the year 1665 for you must understand
that most of these last Prophecies were to be fulfilled in the Reign of
_Henry_ IV.

    French.

    Un peu devant l’ouvert commerce,
    Ambassadeur viendra de _Perse_,
    Nouvelle au Franc Pais porter,
    Mais non receu vaine esperance,
    A son grand Dieu sera l’offense,
    Feignant de le vouloir quitter.

    English.

    A little before that Trade shall be open,
    An Embassador shall come from _Persia_,
    To bring news into _France_,
    But he shall not be received, O vain hope!
    To his great God shall the offence be,
    Faining that he would leave him.

ANNOT.

In the year 1608. the year before the Truce was concluded between the
_Spaniard_ and the _Hollanders_, by which all free Commerce was opened
through _Europe_. The King of _Persia_ being then in War with the great
_Turk_, sent an Embassador to all the Christian Princes, and chiefly into
_France_, to move them to make a diversion in so fit a time, but he could
prevail nothing, and went back again _re infecta_, which he thought to be
a great injury done to his Prophet _Mahomet_.


IX.

    French.

    Deux Estendars du costé de l’_Auvergne_,
    Senestre pris, pour un temps prison regne,
    Et un Dame enfant voudra mener,
    An Censuart, mais discouvert l’affaire,
    Danger de mort, murmure sur la Terre,
    Germain, _Bastille_, Frere & Sœur prisonier.

    English.

    Two Standards in the County of _Auvergne_,
    The left one taken, for a while Prison shall reign,
    And a Lady shall endeavour to carry a child
    To the Censuart, but the plot being discovered,
    Danger of Death, murmur upon Earth,
    Own Brother, _Bastille_, Brother and Sister prisoners.

ANNOT.

This Stanza being most obscure and difficult, cannot be understood so
well by parcels, as by laying down the whole _Synopsis_ of it, which I do
the more willingly, because I think it will be delightful to the Reader,
and that the whole being known, the meaning of every particular will
easily be understood.

_Charles_ the IX. King of _France_, the last of the House of _Valois_
left only one natural Son, called the Earl of _Auvergne_, who had a
Sister by the Mothers side, that was called _Henrietta de Balzac_
Duchess of _Verneuil_, once Mistriss to _Henry_ the IV. by whom she had
upon promiss of marriage one Son, at this time Duke of _Verneuil_, and
Governour of _Languedoc_; but this promiss being made void by Act of
Parliament, _Henry_ IV. married _Mary_ of _Medicis_, by which he had
issue _Lewis_ the XIII. and other children: now upon the discontent
of the Marshal of _Biron_, the Dutchess of _Verneuil_, the Earl of
_Auvergne_ her Brother, and their party joyned with him for the promoting
of the Duke of _Verneuil_’s interest to the Crown, whereupon the King
sent for the Earl of _Auvergne_, who was then in his County a hundred
Leagues from _Paris_; but the Earl trusting more the good will of the
Citizens of _Clermont_ in _Auvergne_ who loved him, then to the Kings
Clemency, neglected to come, whereupon the King sent again the Lord
d’_Escures_, with a pardon for what was past; he promised to come when
he should see his pardon Signed and Sealed in good form; the King was
offended at his proceeding, and took it very ill that a Subject of his
would capitulate with him, who intended to deal plainly and sincerely;
the King nevertheless past that over for many considerations, one of
them was that the Earl was of the blood of _France_, and brother by the
Mother to one that had been his Mistress, besides that he was a Prince
endowed with many good qualities, most of which did Sympathise with those
of the King, thus the King sent him his Pardon as well for what was
past, as for the present, but with this proviso that he should come; for
all this, he did not stir out of _Clermont_; the King seeing that, did
resolve to have him at any rate: there was several propositions made for
to take him: at Hunting, at running of the Ring, at some Banquet, in the
Fields, in the City; all these ways might be suspected by the Earl, but a
new one was found out, of which he himself was the Author; the Troop of
the Duke of _Vendosme_ was preparing for to Muster, the Earl intreated
d’_Eurre_ Lieutenant of the said company, that it might be in the Fields
by _Clermont_ towards _Nonnain_, because he intended to take revenge
in the behalf of a Lady, upon the Inhabitants of that place. The King
sent directions and orders to d’_Eurre_, how he should govern himself
in that action, and gave him for Associates, _la Boulaye_, Lieutenant
of the Marquess of _Verneuil_’s Troop, and _Nerestan_ Colonel of a Foot
Regiment. By the Kings advice they imparted the business to the Viscount
of _Pont du Chasteau_, to the Baron of _Canillac_ and some others, that
had authority in that Province, and were devoted to the Kings service,
and all keeping religiously the Laws of silence. The 12 of _November_ the
Troop met at the Rendezvous; the Earl came thither by times with two only
of his followers, thinking that the Troop should not be ready so soon,
and so he should have pretext either to go back to _Clermont_, or to go
on further to visit his Mistress. The prudence and diligence of those
that managed the business did prevent him, and begot a suspition in him,
for he was seen to truss up his Cloak and to try whither his sword did
not stick to the Scabbard. D’_Eurre_ went to him, and having complemented
him rode on his left hand, while the Troop was setting in order;
_Nerestan_ came to salute him on the other side, and rode on his right
hand, being followed by three stout Souldiers, habited like Lackeys, and
appointed for this action. The Viscount of _du Pont du Chasteau_ and his
brother rode out of the Troop and encompassed him on all sides. One of
the Souldiers laid hold on the Horses Bridle; d’_Eurre_ at the same time
laid hold on his Swords Hilt, saying, my Lord, we are commanded by the
King to give him an account of your person, and we intreat you to submit
unto his Majesties good pleasure, that we may have no occasion to use
you otherways then we desire. _Maison-ville_ and _Liverne_ who were his
two followers drew their Swords, thinking to make him way to escape, but
some shot spent upon them, made them presently retire and run away. He
was put upon a Trumpeters Nag as far as _Briare_, and thence conducted to
_Montargis_ in a Coach, and afterwards by water to _Paris_ and put in the
Bastille.

By this History, and the explication of the word _Censuart_, which is an
ancient word derived from the Latine word _Censor_; and taken here for
the Kingly office, the whole Prophecy is easily understood, and obvious
to the meanest capacity.

    A great deal of trouble before the end of it.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy is concerning _Mary Stuart_ Queen of _Scots_ put in Prison
by Queen _Elizabeth_, who is called here the opponant Queen, to the
Embassy that the said Queen of _Scots_ sent for relief to the King of
_France_, called here the great Physitian.

    Durant le Siecle on verra deux ruisseaux,

    Par le _Gardon_ bien souvent travaillez,
    Six cens & quattre, _Ales_ & trente Moines.

    English.

    In this Age two Rivolets shall be seen,
    To overflow a whole Countrey with their waters,
    And to drown by Rivolets and Fountains,
    _Coups_, and _Monfrein_, _Beccoiran_ and _Alais_,
    By the _Gardon_ often troubled,
    Six hundred and four _Alais_, and thirty Monks.

ANNOT.

An Age is the space of one hundred years, the meaning therefore of this
is, that within the Age following, his Prophecies namely as he saith
after, in the year 1664. there shall be great Inundation in _Languedoc_,
caused by the overflowing of two small Rivers, besides that of _Gardon_,
which Inundation shall drown these following places, _Coups_, _Monfrein_,
_Becoyran_ and _Alais_, besides, and Abbey wherein there was 30. Monks,
but of this I could find nothing in the History, therefore those that
live about those places must make it good.

    The quarrel of two great Lords,
    Shall be near _Gevaudan_,
    In a Church after the Offering,
    A murder committed, the Priest shall ask,
    And quaking for fear, shall save himself.

ANNOT.

This (like the former) is a particuler accident, of which the publick
History taketh no notice; it seemeth that in the year 1665. in
_Gevaudan_, a Province of _France_ near _Languedoc_, there was a great
quarrel between two Lords who meeting at Church, did about the time of
the Offering set one upon another, and one of them was killed, whereupon
the Priest being terrified, ran away.

    By the potent Emperour General,
    To whom in the world there is not his like or equal,
    Wherefore every one yieldeth obedience to him.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie was concerning the Duke of _Savoy_ and _Henry_ the IV. for
about that time mentioned by the Author, after the death of Marshal _de
Biron_, who sided with the Duke of _Savoy_ (which death is called here
Gall put into an Egg;) the Duke of _Savoy_ refused to perform the treaty
concerning the restitution of the Marquisate of _Saluces_, wherefore
_Henry_ the IV. went and subdued most of his Countrey, and compelled him
to give the Province of _Bresse_ instead of the said Marquisate.

    Beginning again more than ever,
    Six hundred and five about the Spring,
    The taking and retaking shall be,
    Souldiers in the fields till Winter,
    And after that shall begin again.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is about the same subject as the precedent. By the great
Siege here is meant the Siege of _Montpelian_, the strongest place in
_Savoy_, which _Henry_ the IV. took, and by it compelled the Duke of
_Savoy_ to an agreement. The rest is easie.

ANNOT.

The three first Verses are concerning _Clement_ the VIII. who was elected
Pope about that time, and was Instrumental to make a Peace between the
King of _France_ and the Duke of _Savoy_, and was Pope a good while.

By the great Ship is meant the Church, of which he is called Master. The
rest is easie.

    Shall take the unction of the Sovereign,
    Or in six hundred and six in _June_,
    Great joy shall be to the Great ones, and to the Commons,
    Great feats shall be after this great Baptism.

ANNOT.

In the year 1606. the 14 of _September_, instead of which the printer
hath put _October_, the Dolphin of _France_, _Lewis_ the XIII. son to
_Henry_ the IV. was Christened with his two Sisters at _Fountainbleau_,
and because the Ceremonies were extraordinary, and our Author calleth
this a great Baptism, it will not be amiss for the satisfaction of the
curious Reader, to give here succinctly a description of it.

In the great quadrangle of the Castles Yard, was erected a great
Theatre, all spread and hanged with most rich Carpets and Hangings, in
the middle of which Theatre was a square of thirty foot on each side,
with rails about it, all covered with Carpets, in the front of it was
erected an Altar, adorned with the Ornaments belonging to the Order of
the Holy Ghost, behind the Table was a Footstool of three steps, spread
with Carpets, and in the middle of the Footstool was a kind of a Stand,
covered with a Silver Cloth, upon which were the Fount, covered with a
most exquisite Towel, and a Canopy over it, on both sides of the Altars
were two Scaffolds for two Quires of Musick, and a little lower on the
right hand a Bench covered with Carpets for the Prelates to sit, among
which were three Archbishops, nine Bishops and three Abbots, on the
left hand were the Lords of the Councel, and before the Altar was the
Cardinal of _Gondy_, encompassed with Almoners and Chaplains, and a great
multitude of spectators seated upon Benches, in form of a Theatre, round
about the Theatre were the guard of _Switzers_, having every one a Torch
in his hand.

The Dolphin and his Sisters were in their Chambers upon Beds of State,
with their Robes lined with Hermines, and were brought to the quadrangle,
the waiting Gentlemen going before with Torches in their hands, with the
Bed Chamber men, and Gentlemen of the Chamber, five Drums, Waits, and
Trumpeters, Heralds, and the Knights of the Holy Ghost, with the three
Honours; in the first, for the youngest Daughter, the Ewer, the Bason,
the Pillow, the Wax Taper, the Chrisme, the Saltseller, were carryed
by the Baron, Son to Marshal _de la Chastre_, by the Lords _Montigny_,
_la Rochepot_, _Chemerand_, _Liencourt_, _Fervacques_, and the Lady was
carryed by the Marshal of _Bois Dauphin_, followed by _Charles_ Duke of
_Lorrain_ Godfather, and of _Don Juan de Medicis_, Brother to the great
Duke of _Tuscany_, representing _Christian_, Daughter to the Duke of
_Lorrain_, and Wife of the great Duke. After that followed the Dutches
of _Guise_, the Countesses of _Guiche_, of _Saulx_, the Marchioness
_Monlaur_, and other Ladies.

The Marshals of _Laverdin_, and of _la Chastre_, the Dukes of _Silly_,
of _Monbazon_, of _Espernon_, of _Esguillon_ did the same office for
the elder Lady. The Lord of _Ragny_ carryed her for _Diana_ Dutchess
of _Angoulesme_, who did represent the _Infanta_, _Clara_, _Eugenia_,
_Eusabella_, Archidutchess of _Austria_, followed by the Dutchess of
_Rohan_, _Montmorency_, _Mayenne_.

The third Honour for the Dolphin was carried by the Earl of _Vaudemont_,
the Knight of _Vendosme_ his elder Brother, the Duke of _Mensier_, the
Earl of _Soissons_, and the Prince of _County_, all three Princes of the
Blood, and the Dolphin was carryed by the Lord _Souvray_ his Governour,
in the room of the Prince of _Condé_, first Prince of the Blood, who
because of his sickness could do him no other service then to hold him
by the hand. The Duke of _Guise_ carryed his Train, and the Cardinal of
_Joyouse_ followed him, representing the Pope _Paul_ the V. then followed
_Eleonor_ Wife to _Vincent_ Duke of _Mantua_, and the Princess of the
Blood, all richly attired.

The Dolphin being brought upon the Table of the quadrangle, the Cardinal
of _Gondy_ appointed for this Ceremony, came near him; and having heard
him answer pertinently to the questions asked by the Almoner according to
the usual forms, and to say the Lords Prayer and the Creed in Latine, he
was exercised, appointed, and by the Cardinal of _Joyouse Legat_, named
_Lewis_.

The Ladies were afterwards brought upon the Table, and the eldest,
named _Elizabeth_ by the Dutchess of _Angoulesme_, representing the
Archidutchess her Godmother, without any Godfather.

The youngest was named by _Don Juan_ of _Medicis_ (representing the great
Dutchess) _Christierne_.

At Supper the King was waited upon by the Princess of his Blood;
the Prince of _Condé_ served for Pantler, the Prince of _Compty_
for Cupbearer, the Duke of _Monpensier_ for Squire Carver, the Earl
of _Soissons_ for high Steward, the Duke of _Guise_ and the Earl of
_Vondemont_ waited upon the Queen, and the Duke of _Sully_ waited upon
the Legat. The Godfathers sat, and after them the Princesses, Ladies
and Lords of high quality, at the great Ball the Duke of _Lorrain_ did
precede by the Kings order, for the only consideration that he was
Godfather.

The next day there was a runing at the Ring, and at night the Duke of
_Sully_ caused an artificial Castle to be assaulted with an innumerable
quantity of Squibs, Chambers, Canon shots, and other Fire Works, but
never any thing was seen more incredible or wonderful, then the beauty,
ornament and lustre of the Princesses and Ladies of the Court; The Eyes
could not stedfastly behold the splendor of the Gold, nor the brightness
of the Silver, nor the glittering of Jewels; the Princes and Lords did
out vie one another who should be most richly attired, among the rest
the Duke of _Espernon_ had a Sword valued at 30000. Crowns, and upon the
Queens Gown were 32000. Pearls, and 3000. Diamonds.


XVII.

    French.

    Au mesme temps un grand endurera,

    Mais peuapres sans faire long sejour,
    Deux se donront l’un l’autre de la teste.

    English.

    At the same time a great one shall suffer,
    Joyful, sickly, shall not see the year compleat,
    And some others who shall be of the feast,
    A feast for one only at that day,
    But a little while after without long delay,
    Two shall knock one another in the head.

ANNOT.

This Stanza hath relation to the precedent, for about the time of, or a
little before that famous Christning died Pope _Leo_ the IX. formerly
called Cardinal of _Florence_, who did not live a whole year in the
papacy; and is called here _Joyful_, _Sickly_, because though infirm, he
did much rejoyce in the obtaining of it; those others that were of the
Feast, were some Cardinals of his party, who died also within the same
year.

The two last Verses signifie the differences that happened, between
_Paul_ V. his Successor, and the Common-wealth of _Venice_ presently
after his death.

    French.

    Considerant la triste _Philomele_,

    Shortning by such means her days,
    Six hundred and five shall see the end,
    Of her torment, then the Cloath Woven,
    By her sinister means shall have help.

ANNOT.

This sad _Philomela_ was _Henrietta_ of _Balzac_ Daughter to _Francis_ of
_Balzac_, Marquess of _Entragues_, and Mistress to _Henry_ the IV. who
being found guilty of a Conspiracy against the State, was confined to the
Abbey of the Nuns of _Beaumont lez Tours_, where she was seven Months,
after which the King taking pitty of her, passed a Declaration, wherein
in respect of his former Love, and of the Children that he had by her,
he forgave her all what was past, did abolish and suppress for ever the
Memory of the Crime that she was accused off, and did dispense her from
appearing before the Parliament, who in her absence did Register her
Letters of Pardon the 6. of _September_ 1605. Thus Reader you may see how
punctual was our Author in his Prognostications.

    Six hundred and five, six hundred and six and seven,
    Will shew us unto the year seventeen,
    The anger of the bontefeu, his hatred and envy,
    Under the Olive-Tree a great while hidden,
    The Crocodile upon the ground hath hidden,
    What was dead, shall then be alive.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is so difficult, signifieth nothing but the confusions that
have happened in _France_ from the year 1605. to the year 1617. which
would be too tedious and prolix here to relate, the Reader may see them
in the _French_ History.

    He that hath many times,
    Been in the Cage and in the Woods,
    Cometh again to his first being,
    And shall go out a little after with his life safe,
    And not able yet to know himself,
    Shall seek a subject to be put to death.

ANNOT.

This is yet concerning the Earl of _Auvergne_ half Brother to the
Dutchess of _Verneuil_, who for his misdemeanours having been put several
times in the Bastille, and set free again, nevertheless was attempting
still some new thing, which might have endangered his life.

    The Author of evils shall begin to Reign,
    In the year six hundred and seven, without sparing,
    All the subjects that belong to the Leech,
    And afterwards shall come by little and little,
    To the free Countrey to kindle again his fire,
    Going back again from whence it came.

ANNOT.

The Author being a zealous Roman Catholick, calls here the _Hollanders_
the Authors of evils, who in the year 1607 and 1608. made a grievous War,
and had several successes against the _Spaniard_, with the help of the
_French_ and _English_, till the year 1609. when by the mediation of the
_French_ and _English_ Embassadors, the Truce was concluded at _Antwerp_,
between the Arch-duke and the States of the _United Provinces_, the
Articles of it to the number of 38. were solemnly proclaimed and
published the ninth of _April_, and ratified by the King of _Spain_ in
the Month of _July_ next ensuing.

    La fin conduit les homines sur la Terre,

    English.

    He that shall say discovering the business,
    How of the dead, can make a death well,
    Strokes of a Dagger by one that hath been induced to it,
    His end shall be worse then he hath caused to be done,
    The end leadeth all men upon the Earth,
    Espied every where, as well by day as by night.

ANNOT.

This Stanza is wholly abstruse and Enigmatical, therefore I will not
pretend to expound it, but leave the interpretation to those that have
more time and leasure then I.

    French.

    Quand la grand Nef, la prove & Gouvernail,

    English.

    When the great Ship, the Prow, and Rudder,
    Of the _French_ Countrey, and her vital Spirit,
    Being tossed by Baks and Waves,
    Six hundred and seven, and ten, a heart beset,
    And by the ebbing of his body afflicted,
    Her life being upon this, evil knotted again.

ANNOT.

This Stanza signifieth the great troubles that were in _France_ from the
year 1610 in which _Henry_ the IV. died, to the year 1617. in which the
Marshal d’_Ancre_ was killed.

This man was named _Concino Concini_ a _Florentine_ born, who in a little
time was grown very great, and from a base extraction had ascended to
the dignity of Marshal of _France_, by the favour of the Queen Regent
_Mary_ of _Medicis_, and grew so rich, that he offered to the King to
maintain at his own charge 6000. foot, and 800. Horses for four Months
together; he had made himself Master of many strong Places in _Picardy_
and _Normandy_, went about to buy the Government of several Provinces,
did dispose of the Kings Exchequer at his pleasure, and spent vast sums
of money at his Masters charge. His insolencies were the cause of his
ruine, when he thought least of it; for he threatned every one with words
and deeds, so far as to say, that he would cause them to eat up their
fingers, that should oppose his Will, and so caused many Officers and
Souldiers of the contrary party to be put to death. The King _Lewis_
the XIII. was particularly informed of the unsufferable pride and
misdemeanors of this Marshal, and that his design was to keep up the War
in _France_, to continue his Authority and Power; therefore the King
commanded _Vitry_, the Captain of his Guards, to apprehend him. This was
a difficult thing, because that the Marshal (besides his Menial servants)
had always twelve Guards wearing his Livery, that were desperate fellows;
there was also another difficulty, because no body could tell, when or
at what time he would come to the _Louvre_; nevertheless at last he came
to it, upon the 24. of _April_ 1617. attended with a great Train and
his Guards; the great Gate was opened to him, and presently shut again,
_Vitry_ drew near to him, and holding his staff to him, said, _I arrest
you in the Kings name_, upon these words the Marshal stept back, as if
it were to make resistance, saying, _Me?_ whereupon those that were with
_Vitry_ shot three Pistols at him, one did hit him in the Heart, the
other in the Head, and the third in the Belly, so that he fell down dead
immediately upon his left side, a certain Lord that was on his right hand
speaking with him, fell down also without any hurt, but his followers
seeing him dead run away.

This death was the cause of great alteration, in the publick Government.
The body of the said Marshal was buried at St. _Germain de l’Auxerrois_,
but the people digged it out, and dragged it to the new Bridge, where
they hanged it by the feet upon a Gibbet, having cut off his Nose,
his Ears and his privy parts, then they took him down, and dragged him
through the Town, and afterwards burnt it. Thus did perish he that was
worth about two Millions of Pounds Sterling, and pretended to make his
house perpetual and Sovereign. The new Officers that had governed the
State from the 24 of _November_ to the 24 of _April_ 1617. were arrested
in their houses, and the old ones put in again, and the Princes called
back again to the Court.


XXIV.

    French.

    Le _Mercurial_ non de trop longue vie,
    Six cens & huit & vingt, grand maladie,
    Et encor pis danger de feu & d’eau,
    Son grand amy lors luy sera contraire,
    De tels hazards se pourroit bien distraire,
    Mais bref, le ser luy sera son Tombeau.

    English.

    The _Mercurial_ not too long lived,
    Six hundred and eight and twenty, a great sickness,
    And what is worse a danger of fire and water,
    His great friend then shall be against him,
    He might well avoid those dangers,
    But a little after, the Iron shall make his Sepulcher.

ANNOT.

This is concerning _Lewis_ the XIII. King of _France_, who fell
dangerously sick of the Plague at _Lions_, about the year 1628. after
that went with his Army into _Savoy_, where he escaped many dangers of
fire and water. As for the Verse it must not be understood, as if he had
been killed, but that the cares he took about his Armies should shorten
his days. The fourth Verse is to be understood of the Lord _Bellingham_,
then favorite to the King, who forsook him in his sickness, for which he
was afterwards disgraced, and could never come into favour again.


XXV.

    French.

    Six cens & six, six cens & neuf,
    Un Chancelier gros comme un Bœuf
    Vieux comme le _Phœnix_ du Monde,
    En ce Terroir plus ne luira,
    De la Nef doubly passera,
    Au Champs _Elysiens_ faire ronde.

    English.

    Six hundred and six, six hundred and nine,
    A Chancellor big as an Oxe,
    Old as the _Phœnix_ of the World,
    Shall shine no more in this Countrey,
    Shall pass from the Ship of forgetfulness,
    Into the _Elysian_ Fields to go the round.

ANNOT.

Six and nine joyned together makes 15. the meaning of this therefore is,
that about the year 1615. should die the Chancellor of _France_, who was
then _Nicolas Brulart_ Lord of _Sillery_ a very corpulent man.


XXVI.

    French.

    Deux freres sont de l’ordre Ecclesiastique,
    Dont l’un prendra pour la _France_ la pique,
    Encor un coup si l’an six cens & six,
    N’est afflige d’une grand maladie,
    Les Armes en main jusques six cens & dix,
    Gueres plus loing ne s’estendant sa vie.

    English.

    Two Brothers are of the Ecclesiastical Order,
    One of which shall take up the Pike for _France_,
    Once more, is in the year six hundred and six,
    He be not afflicted with a great sickness,
    The Weapons in his hands till six hundred and ten,
    His Life shall reach not much further.

ANNOT.

In the year 1606. there was two Brothers of the House of _Joyeuse_, one
called _Francis_ Cardinal of _Joyeuse_, and the other a Capuchin Frier,
the rest of the Brothers being dead without issue; Father Angel got a
dispensation from the Pope to go out of his Covent, and to Marry, that
the Family might not be extinguished, and so turned Courtier and Souldier
again, till he had got a Daughter, who was afterwards married to the Duke
of _Guise_; after that, remembring his Vows, he turned Capuchin again,
and a little while after died, coming from _Rome_ to _Paris_.


XXVII.

    French.

    Celeste seu du costé d’Occident,
    Et du Midy courir jusqu’au Levant,
    Vers demy morts sans point trouver racine,
    Troisiesme Age a _Mars_ le Belliqueux,
    Des _Escarboucles_ on verra briller feux,
    Age _Escarboucle_, & a la fin famine.

    English.

    A Cœlestial fire on the West side,
    And from the South shall run to the East,
    Warm, half dead, and incapable to find Roots,
    The third Age to _Mars_ the Warriour,
    Out of _Carbuncles_ fires shall be seen to shine,
    The Age shall be a _Carbuncle_, but in the end famine.

ANNOT.

This signifies nothing but the troubles that were all _France_ over, from
the year 1620. to the year 1628. when _Rochel_ was taken, and the great
famine that was in the year 1626.


XXVIII.

    French.

    L’An mil six cens & neuf ou quatorziesme
    Le vieux _Charon_ sera Pasques en Caresme,
    Six cens & six par escrit le mettra,
    Le Medecin de tout cecy s’estonne,
    A mesme temps assigné en personne,
    Mais pour certain l’un deux comparoistra.

    English.

    In the year a thousand six hundred and nine or fourteen,
    The old _Charon_ shall Celebrate _Easter_ in Lent,
    Six hundred and six shall put it in writing,
    The Physician wondereth at all this.
    At the same time being Cited in person,
    But for certain, one of them shall appear.

ANNOT.

This signifieth that about the time mentioned by the Author, some great
one should be very sick in Lent, and should eat flesh, which is called
here to _Celebrate Easter in Lent_; and that his Physician wondering
at it should fall sick himself, and that without fail, one of them two
should die.


XXIX.

    French.

    Le Griffon Se peut apprester,
    Pour a l’ennemy resister,
    Er renforcer bien son Armée,
    Autrement l’Elephant viendra,
    Qui d’un abord le surprendra,
    Six cens & huit, Mer enflammée.

    English.

    The Griffin may prepare himself,
    To resist the Enemy,
    And to strengthen his Army,
    Otherways the Elephant shall come,
    Who on a sudden shall surprise him.
    Six hundred and eight, the Sea shall be inflamed.

ANNOT.

By the Griffin was meant the _Hollanders_, who were warned here to beware
of the Elephant, that is, the _Spaniard_, and to strengthen their Army
for fear of being surprised.

The last Verse signifieth, that in the year 1608. there should be a
notable Sea-fight, which was then frequent enough between the said
_Hollanders_ and _Spaniard_.


XXX.

    French.

    Dans peu de temps Medicin du grand mal,
    Et la Sangsue d’ordre & rang inegal,
    Mettront le feu a la branche d’Olive,
    Poste courir d’un & d’autre costé,
    Et par tel feu leur Empire accosté,
    Se rallumant du franc finy salive.

    English.

    Within a little while the Physician of the great disease,
    And the Leech, of order and rank unequal,
    Shall set fire to the branch of Olive,
    Posts shall run to and fro,
    And with such fire their Empire acquainted,
    Shall kindle again with the _French_ finished spittle.

ANNOT.

By the Physitian of the great disease, is meant the King of _France_;
and the Leech the King of _Spain_, so that it is foretold here, how they
shall set fire to the branch of Olive, that is, shall break the Peace and
fall to War, which in the year 1636. when upon the imprisoning of the
Archbishop of _Triers_ by the King of _Spain_, because he had put himself
under the _French_ Protection, the King of _France_ sent an Armv of
40000. men in the _Low-Countreys_, to come with the Prince of _Orange_ at
_Mastricht_, which quarrel hath continued till the Marriage of the King
of _France_ with the Infanta of _Spain_, Daughter to _Philip_ the IV. The
last Verse is forced in, only to make up the rime.


XXXI.

    French.

    Celuy qui a les hazards surmouté,
    Qui fer, feu, eau, na jamais redouté,
    Et du Pais bien proche du _Basacle_,
    D’un coup de fer tout le Monde eftonné,
    Par Crocodil estrangement donné,
    Peuple ravy de voir un tel spectacle.

    English.

    He that hath overcome the dangers,
    That hath never feared Iron, Fire nor Water,
    And of the Countrey near the _Basacle_,
    By a stroke of Iron (all the World being astonished),
    By a Crocodile strangely given,
    People will wonder to see such a spectacle.

ANNOT.

This Prophecy may admit of two Interpretations; the first, that
_Henry_ the IV. who was born in the Province of _Bearn_, not far from
_Thoulouze_, the chief City of _Languedoc_, wherein there is a place upon
the River called _Basacle_, where the Mills are, who was stobbed with a
knife by _Francis Ravillac_ in the year 1610.

The other is of the last Duke of _Montmorency_, who being Governour of
_Languedoc_, took up Arms against the King, in the behalf of the Duke of
_Orleans_, for which he was beheaded at _Thoulouse_ at the solicitation
of Cardinal _Richelieu_, which happened about the year 1632.


XXXII.

    French.

    Vin a foison tres-bon pour les Gendarmes,
    Pleurs & soupirs plaintes, cris, & alarmes,
    Le Ciel fer ses Tonnerres pleuvoir,
    Feu, eau, & sang le tout meslé ensemble,
    Le Ciel de Sol en fremit & en tremble,
    Vivant na veu ce quil pourra bien voir.

    English.

    Plenty of Wine, very good for Troopers,
    Tears, and sighs, complaints, cries, and alarums,
    Heaven shall cause its Thunders to rain,
    Fire, water and blood, all mixed together,
    The Suns Heaven, quaketh and shaketh for it,
    No living man hath seen what he may see then.

ANNOT.

This great plenty of Wine happened in the year 1634. at which time there
was in _France_ such plenty of Grapes, that half of them perished for
want of Vessels to put them in, and I remember very well, that then
whosoever would bring a Poinchon Vessel, which is the third part of a
Tun, might have it filled with Grapes for half a Crown, and that being
my self at that time at a Town of _Burgundy_, called _Beaune_, where
the best Wine of _France_ groweth, four of us had one Pottle of Wine
_English_ measure for one half penny. The rest signifieth no more but
the miseries that happened in _Germany_, by the Wars that the King of
_Sweden_ brought in about the same time.


XXXIII.

    French.

    Bien peu apres sera tres-grand misere,
    De pou de Bled qui sera sur la Terre,
    De _Dauphiné_, _Provence_ & _Vivarois_,
    Au _Vivarois_ est un pauvre presage,
    Pere du fils sera _Antrophophage_,
    Et mangeront Racine & gland du Bois.

    English.

    A little after shall be a great misery,
    Of the scarcity of Corn that shall be upon the ground
    Of _Dauphine_, _Provence_, and _Vivarois_,
    In _Vivarois_ is a poor presage,
    Father of son shall be Antropophage,
    And shall eat Roots and Acorns of the Wood.

ANNOT.

This came to pass when the Duke of _Rohan_ headed the Protestant party,
and made those Provinces the seat of the Civil Wars in _France_, about
the year 1640. or 1642.


XXXIV.

    French.

    Princes & Seigneurs tous se feront la guerre,
    Cousin Germain, le Frere avec le Frere,
    Finy l’Arby de l’heureux de _Bourbon_,
    De _Hierusalem_ les Princes aimables,
    Du fait commis enorme & execrable,
    Se ressentiront sur la bourse sans fond.

    English.

    Princes and Lords shall war one against another
    Cousin German, the Brother against the Brother,
    The Arby finished of the happy _Bourbon_,
    The Princes of _Hierusalem_ so lovely,
    Of the enormous and execrable fact committed
    Shall ressent upon the bottomless Purse.

ANNOT.

This foretelleth of the Wars that were to be between the Princes and
Lords a little after the death of _Henry_ the IV. when the Marshal
d’_Ancre_ took upon him the administration of affairs by the favour of
the Queen Regent _Mary_ of _Medicis_.


XXXV.

    French.

    Dame par mort grandement atristée,
    Mere & tutrice au lang qui la quittée,
    Dame & Seigneurs faits enfants Orphelins,
    Par les Aspics & par les Crocodiles,
    Seront surpris forts bourgs, Chasteaux & Villes,
    Dieu tout puissant les garde des malins.

    English.

    A Lady by death greatly afflicted,
    Mother and Tutor to the Blood that hath left her,
    Ladies and Lords made Orphans,
    By Asps and by Crocodiles,
    Shall strong holds, Castles and Towns be surprised,
    God Almighty keep them from the wicked.

ANNOT.

That great Lady afflicted by death, and Mother and Tutor to the Blood
that left her was _Mary_ of _Medicis_, Wife to _Henry_ the IV. who after
the death of her Husband was much troubled in her regency by her own Son
_Lewis_ the XIII. and several great Lords of his party whence did follow
the Battle of _Pont de Cé_.


XXXVI.

    French.

    La grand rumeur qui sera par la _France_,
    Les impuissans voudront avoir puissance,
    Langue emmiellée & vrais Cameleons,

    Pyes & Geais, rapporteurs de nouvelles,
    Dont la morsure semblera Scorpions.

    English.

    The great rumor that shall be through _France_,
    The impuissants would fain have power,
    Honey Tongues, and true Camelions,
    Bourefeux, and lighters of Candles,
    Magpies and Jays, carriers of news,
    Whose biting shall be like that of Scorpions.

ANNOT.

This hath a relation to the precedent, and expresseth further the misery
of those times.


XXXVII.

    French.

    Foible & puissant seront en grand discord,
    Plusieurs mourront avant faire l’accord,
    Foible ou puissant vainqueur se fera dire,
    Le plus puissant au jeune cedera,
    Et le plus vieux des deux decedera,
    Lors que l’un d’eux envahira l’Empire.

    English.

    The Weak and powerfull shall be at great variance,
    Many shall die before they agree,
    The weak shall cause the powerful to call him Victor,
    The most potent shall yield to the younger,
    And the older of the two shall die,
    When one of the two shall invade the Empire.

ANNOT.

This Prophecie is not come to pass yet (for all I know) therefore I leave
the interpretation to every ones liberty.


XXXVIII.

    French.

    Par Eau, & par fer & par grand maladie,
    Le Pourvoieur a l’hazard de sa vie,
    Scaura combien vaut le Quintal de Bois,
    Six cens & quinze ou le dixneufiesme,
    On gravera d’un grand Prince cinquiesme,
    L’Immortel nom sur le pied de la Croix.

    English.

    By Water, by Fire, and by great sickness,
    The Purveyor to the hazard of his life,
    Shall know how much is worth the Quintal of Wood,
    Six hundred and fifteen, or the nineteen,
    There shall be graven of a great Prince the fifth,
    The immortal name upon the foot of the Cross.

ANNOT.

By the Purveyor is meant the King of _France_, as we have said before.

The great Prince the V. was _Paul_ the V. who was foretold he should die
about the year 1615. 1619.


XXXIX.

    French.

    Le Pourvoieur de Monstre sans pareil,
    Se sera voir ainsy que le Soleil,
    Montant le long la ligne Meridienne,
    En poursuivant l’Elephant & le Loup,
    Nul Empereur ne fit jamais tel coup,
    Et rien plus pis a ce Prince n’avienne.

    English.

    The Purveyor of the Monster without equal,
    Shall shew himself like the Sun,
    Ascending in the Meridional line,
    In persecuting the Elephant and the Wolf,
    No Emperour did ever such an act,
    I wish nothing worse may happen to that Prince.

ANNOT.

This is a Prophecie of the glorious success that _Lewis_ the XIII. was to
have against the _Spaniard_ in _Italy_, and the Protestant party at home.


XL.

    French.

    Ce qu’en vivant le Pere n’avoit sceu,
    Il acquerra ou par guerre ou par feu,
    Et Combatra la sangsue irritée,
    Ou jouira de son bien paternel,
    Et savory du grand Dieu Eternel,
    Aura bien tost sa Province heritée.

    English.

    That which while he lived the father did not know,
    He shall get it either by Water or by Fire,
    And shall fight with the angry Leech,
    Or shall enjoy his Paternal goods,
    And be favorised by the great Eternal God,
    Shall quickly become Heir of his Province.

ANNOT.

This concerneth the present King of _France_ _Lewis_ the XIV. who hath
lately got by Fire and Sword those Provinces in the _Low Countreys_, to
which he laid claim by his Wives Title, which his father never knew nor
attempted.


XLI.

    French.

    Vaisseaux Galeres avec leur Estendar,

    Mais a la fin unie a la Coronne.

    English.

    Ships and Galleys with their Standard,
    Shall fight near the Mountain _Gilbatar_,

    But at last shall be united to the Crown.

ANNOT.

This Prophecieth the reduction of the City of _Pampelona_, the chief City
of the Kingdom of _Navarre_, under the obedience of the King of _France_
and _Navarre_.


XLII.

    La grand Cité ou est le premier homme,
    Bien amplement la ville ie vous nomme,
    Tout en alarme, & le Soldat es Champs,

    English.

    The great City where the first man is,
    Fully I name the Town to you,
    Shall be alarmed and the Souldier in the field,
    Shall be by Fire and Water greatly afflicted,
    And at last shall be helped by the _French_,
    But it shall be from six hundred and ten years.

ANNOT.

That great City where the first man is, is _Amsterdam_, because the first
Letter and the last Sylable of it maketh _Adam_: But of her affliction
by Fire and Water, and of her being relieved by the _French_ in the year
1610. I can find nothing in the History; those that are better furnished
with Books than I am, may chance to satisfie themselves and others,
better than I can do.


XLIII.

    French.

    Le petit coin Provinces mutinées,
    Par forts Chasteaux se verront dominées,

    Once more by the Military Troops,
    Within a little while shall be strongly Besieged,
    But shall be helped by a great one,
    That hath made his entry in _Beaucaire_.

ANNOT.

This little Corner and Provinces revolted are _Holland_, and the rest of
the United Provinces, who are threatned here with many troubles, as they
did suffer till the Peace of _Munster_.

That great man that helped them, was the King of _France_.


XLIV.

    French.

    La belle Rose en la _France_ admirée,
    D’un tres-grand Prince a la fin desirée,

    And of such deeds the end shall be seen.

ANNOT.

I think this needeth no further explication, then that I have given upon
the 31. Stanza.


XLVI.

    French.

    Les Pourvoieux mettra tout en desroute,
    Sangsue & Loup, en mon dire escoute,
    Quand _Mars_ sera au Signe du _Mouton_,
    Joint a _Saturne_, _Saturne_ a la Lune,
    Alors sera ta plus grande infortune,
    Le Soleil lors en exaltation.

    English.

    The Purveyor shall put all in disorder,
    Leech and Wolf, do ye hearken to me,
    When _Mars_ shall be in the Sign of _Aries_,
    Joyned with _Saturn_, and _Saturn_ with the Moon,
    Then shall be thy greatest misfortune,
    The Sun being then in its exaltation.

_Savoy_.


XLVII.

    French.

    Le grand d’_Hongrie_ ira dans la Nacelle,

    The new born shall make a new War,
    To his Neighbour, whom he shall Besiege,
    And the black one with his Highness,
    Shall not suffer to be overpressed,
    During three years he shall keep his Men in order.

ANNOT.

This is concerning the King of _Bohemia_, and his War with the Emperour,
who is called here the _great one of Hungary_, because he is King of it;
_the black one with his Highness_, is the Pals-grave, who after three
years broils was defeated at the Battle of _Prage_.


XLVIII.

    French.

    Du vieux _Charon_ on verra le Phœnix,

    English.

    _Venus_ and _Sol_, _Jupiter_ and _Mercury_,

    A great Alliance shall be made in _France_,
    And on the South the Leech shall do the same,
    The fire extinguished by this extreme remedy,
    Shall plant the Olive-Tree in a firm ground.

ANNOT.

By the consent of all Astronomers, those four benigne Planets augment
generation.

That great Alliance mentioned here, by which the fire was extinguished,
and the Olive-Tree planted in a firm ground, is the Marriage of the
present King of _France_, _Lewis_, the XIV. with the Infanta of _Spain_,
by which all differences were composed, and the Peace firmly settled.


L.

    French.

    Un peu devant ou apres l’_Angleterre_,

    Faute de pain, bondance de cousteau.

    English.

    A little while before or after, _England_,
    By the death of the Wolf being put as low as the ground,
    Shall see the fire resist against the water,
    Kindling it again with such force,
    Of humane blood, upon the humane bark,
    That want of bread and abundance of knives shall be.

ANNOT.

The meaning is, that a little while after or before the said match
mentioned in the foregoing: _England_ was or should be brought as low as
the ground, and that there should be abundance of humane blood spilled,
and a great decay of Trade, with Wars, which is that he calleth, Want of
Bread and abundance of knives.

    La Ville qu’avoit en ses ans,
    Combatu l’Injure du temps,
    Qui de son Vainqueur tient la vie,
    Celuy qui premier la surprit,
    Que peu apres _Francois_ reprit,
    Par Combats encore affoible.

    English.

    The City that had in her years,
    Resisted the injury of the times,
    And oweth her life to him that overcame her,
    Being the first that surprised it,
    Which a little while after _Francis_ took again,
    Being yet weakened with fightings.


LII.

    French.

    La grand Cité qui n’a Pain a demy,
    Encor un coup la saint _Barthelemy_,
    Engravera au profond de son Ame,
    _Nismes_, _Rochelle_, _Geneve_ & _Montpelier_,
    _Castres_, _Lion_, _Mars_ entrant au _Belier_,
    S’entrebattront le tout pour une Dame.

    English.

    The great City that hath not bread half enough,
    Shall once more engrave
    In the bottom of her soul St. _Bartholomew_’s day,
    _Nismes_, _Rochel_, _Geneva_ and _Montpelier_,
    _Castres_, _Lion_, _Mars_ coming into _Aries_,
    Shall fight one against another, and all for a Lady.

ANNOT.

That great City mentioned here, is _Paris_, which is threatned of another
St. _Bartholomew_’s day, which was fatal to the Protestants in _France_,
for upon that day in the year 1572. there was a general Massacre made
of them through all _France_, insomuch, that in _Paris_ alone there was
above ten thousand slain.

As for those Towns here named that are to fight about a Lady, I cannot
guess what Lady it should be, unless he meaneth the _Roman_ Church.

    French.

    Plusieurs mourront avant que Phœnix meure,
    Jusques six cens septante est sa demeure,
    Passé quinze ans, vingt & un, trente neuf,

    Et le second au fer, danger de vie,
    Au feu a l’eau est subjet a trenteneuf.

    English.

    Many shall die before that Phœnix dieth,
    Till six hundred and seventy he shall remain,
    Above fifteen years, one and twenty, thirty nine,
    The first shall be subject to sickness,
    And the second to Iron, a danger of life,
    Thirty nine shall be subject to fire and water.

ANNOT.

By the Phœnix is meant a Pope, because there is but one of that kind at
once, the meaning of the rest is unknown to me.


LIV.

    French.

    Six cens & quinze vingt, grand Dame mourra,
    Et peu apres un fort long temps pleuvra,

    Many Countreys as _Flanders_ and _England_,
    Shall by fire and Iron be afflicted,
    And a good while Besieged by their Neighbours,
    So that they shall be constrained to make War against them.

ANNOT.

What that great Lady was, that should die in the year 653. is not easie
to guess, there being many in every Countrey that died that year. The
rest is easie, and we have seen the truth of it in our days, and may see
it hereafter.


LV.

    French.

    Un peu devant ou apres tres grand’ Dame,
    Son ame au Ciel, & son corps soubs la lame,

    Et a deux grands le dueil delaissera.

    English.

    A little while before, or after, a very great Lady,
    Her soul in Heaven, and her body in the Grave,

    Tears and sighs of a Lady in her youth,
    And shall leave the mourning to two great ones.

ANNOT.

This may be understood of the death of _Anna_ of _Austria_, Queen of
_France_, who left in mourning two great ones, _viz._ her two Sons
_Lewis_ the XIV. King of _France_, and _Philip_ of _Bourbon_ Duke of
_Orleans_.

Or of the death of the Queen Dowager of _England_, _Henrietta Maria_,
who also was much lamented, and left in mourning two great ones, _viz._
_Charles_ the II. King of _England_, and _James_ Duke of _York_ his
Brother.

    Tost l’Elephant de toutes parts verra,
    Quand Pourvoyeur au Griffon se joindra,

    Shall do great feats near the _Holy Land_,
    Great Standarts upon the Earth and the Sea,
    If the Ship hath been with Child of two Brothers.

ANNOT.

The Elephant is the Emperor, the Purveyor the King of _France_, the
Griffin the _Hollanders_; the meaning then is that the Emperor shall go
to ruine, when the _French_ and the _Hollanders_ shall joyn together.

And that there shall be great Wars and Fightings in the Holy Lands, both
by Sea and Land, when two Brothers of great quality shall go in one Ship.

    Peu apres l’Alliance faite,

    A little while after shall die.

ANNOT.

This is concerning a match that shall be made between the _French_ King,
and some Lady of another Countrey, which Match shall be disturbed by the
Emperour, and the Bride shall die a little while after her Marriage.


LVIII.

    French.

    Sangsue en peu de temps mourra,
    Sa mort bon signe nous donra,

    The _French_ shall have power over them.

ANNOT.

The _Leech_ was _Philip_ the IV. the last King of _Spain_, who died a
little while after he had Married his Daughter to _Lewis_ the XIV. now
King of _France_, by which Marriage the Peace was made between the two
Kingdoms, in the Island of the _Conference_, upon the Borders of _France_
and _Spain_. By his death and that Match is foretold the encrease and
happy condition of the Kingdom of _France_.
