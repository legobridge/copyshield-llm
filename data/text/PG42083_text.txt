_Text format:_

In the printed book, line numbers were squeezed in wherever there was
room. For the e-text, they have been regularized to the EETS-standard
multiples of 4. Line divisions and page numbers were retained for use
with the Index and linenotes, except that some very short words have
been moved up or down to avoid awkward gaps. Headnotes have been
moved to the nearest convenient line break.

Italics representing expanded abbreviations are shown in b{ra}ces.
Other italics are shown conventionally with _lines_. Superscripts are
shown with ^ (caret); they always continue to the end of the word.
Oversized initial letters are shown with double leading ++ as ++A. In
the Appendix, decorative final letters are shown with single + as dar+,
sprong+. Italic thorn (þ) and yogh (ȝ) seem to have been unavailable to
the printer; both letters have been formatted to match the surrounding
text.

The inverted semicolon (rare) is shown in brackets as [;]. All other
bracketed letters or letter groups are in the original.

In the primary text, anomalous spellings with initial “u” or non-initial
“v” are not individually noted. Other errors, whether corrected or not,
are listed at the end of the e-text.

For this e-text, Chaucer’s translation of the _Consolatio_ is given
twice: first as printed, with all notes and apparatus, and then as text
alone.]

INTRODUCTION.


When master hands like those of Gibbon and Hallam have sketched the life
of _Boethius_, it is well that no meaner man should attempt to mar their
pictures. They drew, perhaps, the most touching scene in Middle-age
literary history,--the just man in prison, awaiting death, consoled by
the Philosophy that had been his light in life, and handing down to
posterity for their comfort and strength the presence of her whose
silver rays had been his guide as well under the stars of Fortune as the
mirk of Fate. With Milton in his dark days, Boece in prison could say,--

                                  ‘I argue not
  Against Heaven’s hand or will, nor bate a jot
  Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer
  Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?
  The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied
  In liberty’s defence, my noble task,
  Of which all Europe rings from side to side.’

For, indeed, the echoes of Boethius, Boethius, rang out loud from every
corner of European Literature. An Alfred awoke them in England, a
Chaucer, a Caxton would not let them die; an Elizabeth revived them
among the glorious music of her reign.[I-1] To us, though far off, they
come with a sweet sound. ‘The angelic’ Thomas Aquinas commented on him,
and many others followed the saint’s steps. Dante read him, though,
strange to say, he speaks of the Consolation as ‘a book not known by
many.’[I-2] Belgium had her translations--both Flemish[I-3] and
French[I-4]; Germany hers,[I-5] France hers,[I-6] Italy hers.[I-7] The
Latin editors are too numerous to be catalogued here, and manuscripts
abound in all our great libraries.

No philosopher was so bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of
Middle-age writers as Boethius. Take up what writer you will, and you
find not only the sentiments, but the very words of the distinguished
old Roman. And surely we who read him in Chaucer’s tongue, will not
refuse to say that his full-circling meed of glory was other than
deserved. Nor can we marvel that at the end of our great poet’s life, he
was glad that he had swelled the chorus of Boethius’ praise; and ‘of the
translacioun of Boece de Consolacioun,’ thanked ‘oure Lord Ihesu Crist
and his moder, and alle the seintes in heuen.’

The impression made by Boethius on Chaucer was evidently very deep. Not
only did he translate him directly, as in the present work, but he read
his beloved original over and over again, as witness the following list,
incomplete of course, of passages from Chaucer’s poems translated more
or less literally from the _De Consolatione_:

    [Footnote I-1: Other translations are by John Walton of Osney, in
    verse, in 1410 (Reg. MS. 18, A 13), first printed at Tavistock in
    1525, and to be edited some time or other for the E.E.T.S. An
    anonymous prose version in the Bodleian. George Coluile, alias
    Coldewel, 1556; J. T. 1609; H. Conningesbye, 1664; Lord Preston,

    anon. 1792 (Lowndes).]

    [Footnote I-2: Dante, in his _Convito_, says, “Misimi a legger
    quello _non conosciuto da molti_ libro di Boezio, nel quale
    captivo e discacciato consolato s’avea.”]

I. LOVE.

  Wost thou nat wel the olde clerkes sawe,
  That who schal yeve a lover eny lawe,
  Love is a grettere lawe, by my pan,
  Then may be yeve to (of) eny erthly man?

    (_Knightes Tale, Aldine Series_, vol. ii. p. 36, 37.)

  But what is he þat may ȝeue a lawe to loueres. loue is a gretter
  lawe and a strengere to hym self þan any lawe þat men may ȝeuen.

    (_Chaucer’s Prose Translation_, p. 108.)

  _Quis legem det amantibus?
  Major lex amor est sibi._

    (Boeth., lib. iii. met. 12.)


II. A DRUNKEN MAN.

  A dronke man wot wel he hath an hous,
  But he not[I-8] which the righte wey is thider.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 39.)

  _Ryȝt as a dronke man not nat[I-9] by whiche paþe he may retourne
  home to hys house._

    (Chaucer’s Trans., p. 67.)

  _Sed velut ebrius, domum quo tramite revertatur, ignorat._

    (Boeth., lib. iii. pr. 2.)

    [Footnote I-8: The Harl. MS. reads _not nat_, to the confusion of
    the metre.]

    [Footnote I-9: = ne wot nat = knows not.]


III. THE CHAIN OF LOVE.

  The firste moevere of the cause above,
  Whan he first made the fayre cheyne of love,
  Gret was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
  Wel wist he why, and what therof he mente;
  _For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
  The fyr, the watir, the eyr, and eek the lond
  In certeyn boundes, that they may not flee._

    (_Knightes Tale_, p. 92.)

  That þe world with stable feith / varieth acordable chaungynges //
  þat the contraryos qualite of elementȝ holden amonge hem self
  aliaunce perdurable / þat phebus the sonne with his goldene
  chariet / bryngeth forth the rosene day / þat the mone hath
  commaundement ouer the nyhtes // whiche nyhtes hesperus the eue
  sterre hat[h] browt // þat þe se gredy to flowen constreyneth with
  a certeyn ende hise floodes / so þat it is nat l[e]ueful to
  strechche hise brode termes or bowndes vp-on the erthes // þat is
  to seyn to couere alle the erthe // Al this a-cordaunce of thinges
  is bownden with looue / þat gouerneth erthe and see / and [he]
  hath also commaundementȝ to the heuenes / and yif this looue
  slakede the brydelis / alle thinges þat now louen hem to-gederes /
  wolden maken a batayle contynuely and stryuen to fordoon the
  fasoun of this worlde / the which they now leden in acordable
  feith by fayre moeuynges // this looue halt to-gideres poeples /
  ioygned with an hooly bond / and knytteth sacrement of maryages of
  chaste looues // And loue enditeth lawes to trewe felawes // O
  weleful weere mankynde / yif thilke loue þat gouerneth heuene
  gouerned yowre corages /.

    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, bk. ii. met. 8.)

  Quod mundus stabili fide
  Concordes variat vices,
  Quod pugnantia semina
  Fœdus perpetuum tenent,
  Quod Phœbus roseum diem
  Curru provehit aureo,
  Ut quas duxerit Hesperus
  Phœbe noctibus imperet,
  Ut fluctus avidum mare
  Certo fine coerceat,
  Ne terris liceat vagis
  Latos tundere terminos;
  _Hanc rerum seriem ligat,
  Terras ac pelagus regens,
  Et cœlo imperitans amor._
  Hic si fræna remiserit,
  Quicquid nunc amat invicem,
  Bellum continuo geret:
  Et quam nunc socia fide
  Pulcris motibus incitant,
  Certent solvere machinam.
  Hic sancto populos quoque
  Junctos fœdere continet,
  Hic et conjugii sacrum
  Castis nectit amoribus,
  Hic fidis etiam sua
  Dictat jura sodalibus.
  O felix hominum genus,
  Si vestros animos amor,
  Quo cælum regitur, regat.

    (_Boeth._, lib. ii. met. 8.)

  Love, that of erth and se hath governaunce!
  Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye!
  Love, that with an holsom alliaunce
  Halt peples joyned, as hym liste hem gye!
  Love, that knetteth law and compaignye,
  And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle!

    (_Troylus & Cryseyde_, st. 243, vol. iv. p. 296.)

  That, that the world with faith, which that is stable
  Dyverseth so, his stoundes concordynge;--
  That elementz, that ben so discordable,
  Holden a bond, perpetualy durynge;--
  That Phebus mot his rosy carte forth brynge,
  And that the mone hath lordschip overe the nyghte;--
  Al this doth Love, ay heryed be his myght!

  That, that the se, that gredy is to flowen,
  Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so
  Hise flodes, that so fiersly they ne growen
  To drenchen erth and alle for everemo;
  And if that Love aught lete his brydel go,
  Al that now loveth asonder sholde lepe,
  And lost were al that Love halt now to kepe.

    (_Ibid._ st. 244, 245.)


IV. MUTABILITY DIRECTED AND LIMITED BY AN IMMUTABLE AND DIVINE
INTELLIGENCE.

  That same prynce and moevere eek, quod he,
  Hath stabled, in this wrecched world adoun,
  Certeyn dayes and duracioun
  To alle that er engendrid in this place,
  Over the whiche day they may nat pace,
  Al mowe they yit wel here dayes abregge;
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  Than may men wel by this ordre discerne
  That thilke moevere stabul is and eterne.
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  And therfore of his wyse purveaunce
  He hath so wel biset his ordenaunce,
  That spices of thinges and progressiouns
  Schullen endure by successiouns
  And nat eterne be, withoute any lye.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92, 93.)

  Þe engendrynge of alle þinges quod she and alle þe progressiouns
  of muuable nature. and alle þat moeueþ in any manere takiþ hys
  causes. hys ordre. and hys formes. of þe stablenesse of þe deuyne
  þouȝt [and thilke deuyne thowht] þat is yset and put in þe toure.
  þat is to seyne in þe heyȝt of þe simplicite of god. stablisiþ
  many manere gyses to þinges þat ben to don.

    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, bk. iv. pr. 6, p. 134.)


V. THE PART IS DERIVED FROM THE WHOLE, THE IMPERFECT FROM THE PERFECT.

  Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,
  That every partye dyryveth from his hool.
  For nature hath nat take his bygynnyng
  Of no partye ne cantel of a thing,
  But of a thing that parfyt is and stable,
  Descendyng so, til it be corumpable.

    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92.)

  For al þing þat is cleped inperfit . is proued inperfit by þe
  amenusynge of perfeccioun . or of þing þat is perfit . and her-of
  comeþ it . þat in euery þing general . yif þat . þat men seen any
  þing þat is inperfit . certys in þilke general þer mot ben somme
  þing þat is perfit. For yif so be þat perfeccioun is don awey .
  men may nat þinke nor seye fro whennes þilke þing is þat is cleped
  inperfit . For þe nature of þinges ne token nat her bygynnyng of
  þinges amenused and inperfit . but it procediþ of þingus þat ben
  al hool . and absolut . and descendeþ so doune in-to outerest
  þinges and in-to þingus empty and wiþ-oute fruyt . but as I haue
  shewed a litel her byforne . þat yif þer be a blisfulnesse þat be
  frele and vein and inperfit . þer may no man doute . þat þer nys
  som blisfulnesse þat is sad stedfast and perfit.’

    (bk. iii. pr. 10, p. 89.)

  Omne enim quod imperfectum esse dicitur, id deminutione perfecti
  imperfectum esse perhibetur. Quo fit ut si in quolibet genere
  imperfectum quid esse videatur, in eo perfectum quoque aliquod
  esse necesse sit. Etenim perfectione sublata, unde illud, quod
  imperfectum perhibetur, extiterit, ne fingi quidem potest. _Neque
  enim ab diminutis inconsummatisque natura rerum cepit exordium,
  sed ab integris absolutisque procedens in hæc extrema atque effœta
  dilabitur._ Quod si, uti paulo ante monstravimus, est quædam boni
  fragilis imperfecta felicitas, esse aliquam solidam perfectamque
  non potest dubitari.

    (_Boeth._, lib. iii. pr. 10.)


VI. GENTILITY.

  For gentilnesse nys but renomé
  Of thin auncestres, for her heigh bounté
  Which is a straunge thing to thy persone.

    (_The Wyf of Bathes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 241.)

  For if þe name of gentilesse be referred to renoun and clernesse
  of linage. þan is gentil name but a foreine þing.

    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 78.)

  _Quæ_ [nobilitas], _si ad claritudinem refertur, aliena est._

    (_Boethius_, lib. iii. pr. 6.)


VII. NERO’S CRUELTY.

  No teer out of his eyen for that sighte
  Ne cam; but sayde, a fair womman was sche.
  Gret wonder is how that he couthe or mighte
  Be domesman on hir dede beauté.

    (_The Monkes Tale_, vol. iii. p. 217.)

  Ne no tere ne wette his face, but he was so hard-herted þat he
  myȝte ben domesman or iuge of hire dede beauté.

    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 55.)

  Ora non tinxit lacrymis, sed esse
  Censor extincti potuit decoris.

    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. met. 6.)


VIII. PREDESTINATION AND FREE-WILL.

In ‘Troylus and Cryseyde’ we find the following long passage taken from
Boethius, book v. prose 2, 3.

Book iv. st. 134, vol. iv. p. 339.

  (1) Syn God seth every thynge, out of doutaunce,
      And hem disponeth, thorugh his ordinaunce,
      In hire merites sothely for to be,
      As they shul comen by predesteyné

136

  (2) For som men seyn if God seth al byforne,
      Ne God may not deseyved ben pardé!
      Than moot it fallen, theigh men hadde it sworne,
      That purveyaunce hath seyn befor to be,
      Wherfor I seye, that, from eterne, if he
      Hathe wiste byforn our thought ek as oure dede,
      We have no fre choys, as thise clerkes rede.

137

  (3) For other thoughte, nor other dede also,
      Myghte nevere ben, but swich as purveyaunce,
      Which may nat ben deceyved nevere moo,
      Hath feled byforne, withouten ignoraunce;
      For if ther myghte ben a variaunce,
      To wrythen out fro Goddes purveyinge,
      Ther nere no prescience of thynge comynge;

138

  (4) But it were rather an opinyon
      Uncertein, and no stedfast forseynge;
      And certes that were an abusyon
      That God shold han no parfit clere wetynge,
      More than we men, that han douteous wenynge,
      But swich an erroure upon God to gesse
      Were fals, and foule, and wikked corsednesse.

139

  (5) They seyn right thus, that thynge is nat to come,
      For that the prescience hath seyne byfore
      That it shal come; but they seyn that therfore
      That it shal come, therfor the purveyaunce
      Woot it bifore, withouten ignorance.

140

  (6) And in this manere this necessité
      Retourneth in his part contrarye agayn;
      For nedfully byhoveth it not to be,
      That thilke thynges fallen in certeyn
      That ben purveyed; but nedly, as they seyne,
      Bihoveth it that thynges, which that falle,
      That thei in certein ben purveied alle.

141

  (7) I mene as though I labourede me in this,
      To enqueren which thynge cause of whiche thynge be;

  (8) As, whether that the prescience of God is
      The certein cause of the necessité
      Of thynges that to comen ben, pardé!
      Or, if necessité of thynge comynge
      Be cause certein of the purveyinge.

142

  (9) But now nenforce I me nat in shewynge
      How the ordre of causes stant; but wel woot I
      That it bihoveth that the bifallynge
      Of thynges, wiste bifor certeinly,
      Be necessarie, al seme it nat therby
      That prescience put fallynge necessaire
      To thynge to come, al falle it foule or faire.

143

 (10) For, if ther sit a man yonde on a see, [seat]
      Than by necessité bihoveth it,
      That certes thyn opinioun soth be,
      That wenest or conjectest that he sit;
      And, further over, now ayeinwarde yit,
      Lo right so is it on the part contrarie,
      As thus,--nowe herkene, for I wol nat tarie:--

144

 (11) I sey, that if the opinion of the
      Be soth for that he sit, than seye I this,
      That he moot sitten by necessité;
      And thus necessité in either is,
      For in hym nede of sittynge is, ywis,
      And in the, nede of soth; and thus forsoth
      Ther mot necessité ben in yow bothe.

145

 (12) But thow maist seyne, the man sit nat therfore,
      That thyn opinioun of his sittynge sothe is;
      But rather, for the man sat there byfore,
      Therfor is thyn opinioun soth, ywys;
      And I seye, though the cause of soth of this
      Cometh of his sittynge, yet necessité
      Is interchaunged both in hym and the.

146

 (13) Thus in the same wyse, out of doutaunce,
      I may wel maken, as it semeth me,
      My resonynge of Goddes purveiaunce,
      And of the thynges that to comen be; . . .

147

 (14) For although that for thynge shal come, ywys,
      Therfor it is purveyed certeynly,
      Nat that it cometh for it purveied is;
      Yet, natheles, bihoveth it nedfully,
      That thynge to come be purveied trewly;
      Or elles thynges that purveied be.
      That they bitiden by necessité.

148

 (15) And this sufficeth right ynough, certeyn,
      For to distruye oure fre choys everydele.

  (1) Quæ tamen ille ab æterno cuncta prospiciens providentiæ cernit
  intuitus, et suis quæque meritis prædestinata disponit. . . . .
  (_Boethius_, lib. v. pr. 2.)  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

  (2) Nam si cuncta prospicit Deus neque falli ullo modo potest,
  evenire necesse est, quod providentia futurum esse præviderit.
  Quare si ab æterno non facta hominum modo, sed etiam consilia
  voluntatesque prænoscit, nulla erit arbitrii libertas;

  (3) Neque enim vel factum aliud ullum vel quælibet existere
  poterit voluntas, nisi quam nescia falli providentia divina
  præsenserit. Nam si res aliorsum, quam provisæ sunt detorqueri
  valent, non jam erit futuri firma præscientia;

  (4) Sed opinio potius incerta; quod de Deo nefas credere judico.

  (5) Aiunt enim non ideo quid esse eventurum quoniam id providentia
  futurum esse prospexerit; sed e contrario potius, quoniam quid
  futurum est, id divinam providentiam latere non possit.

  (6) Eoque modo necessarium est hoc in contrariam relabi partem;
  neque enim necesse est contingere quæ providentur, sed necesse est
  quæ futura sunt provideri.

  (7) Quasi vero quæ cujusque rei causa sit,

  (8) Præscientiane futurorum necessitatis an futurorum necessitas
  providentiæ, laboretur.

  (9) At nos illud demonstrare nitamur, quoquo modo sese habeat ordo
  causarum, necessarium esse eventum præscitarum rerum, etiam si
  præscientia futuris rebus eveniendi necessitatem non videatur
  inferre.

  (10) Etenim si quispiam sedeat, opinionem quæ eum sedere conjectat
  veram esse necesse est: at e converso rursus,

  (11) Si de quopiam vera sit opinio quoniam sedet eum sedere
  necesse est. In utroque igitur necessitas inest: in hoc quidem
  sedendi, at vero in altero veritatis.

  (12) Sed non idcirco quisque sedet, quoniam vera est opinio: sed
  hæc potius vera est, quoniam quempiam sedere præcessit. Ita cum
  causa veritatis ex altera parte procedat, inest tamen communis in
  utraque necessitas.

  (13) Similia de providentia futurisque rebus ratiocinari patet.

  (14) Nam etiam si idcirco, quoniam futura sunt, providentur: non
  vero ideo, quoniam providentur, eveniunt: nihilo minus tamen a Deo
  vel ventura provideri, vel provisa evenire necesse est:

  (15) Quod ad perimendam arbitrii libertatem solum satis est.

    (lib. v. pr. 3.)

See _Chaucer’s Boethius_, pp. 154-6.


IX. THE GRIEF OF REMEMBERING BYGONE HAPPINESS.

  For, of fortunes scharp adversité,
  The worste kynde of infortune is this,
  A man to han ben in prosperité,
  And it remembren, when it passed is.

     (_Troylus and Cryseyde_, bk. iii. st. 226, vol. iv. p. 291.)

  Sed hoc est, quod recolentem me vehementius coquit. Nam in omni
  adversitate fortunæ infelicissimum genus est infortunii, fuisse
  felicem.[I-10]

    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. pr. 4.)

    [Footnote I-10: Cf. Dante, _Inferno_, V. 121.

              Nessun maggior dolore
      Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
      Nella miseria; e ciò sa ’l tuo Dottore.]


X. VULTURES TEAR THE STOMACH OF TITYUS IN HELL.

  ----Syciphus in Helle,
  Whos stomak fowles tyren everemo,
  That hyghten volturis.

    (_Troylus and Cryseyde_, book i. st. 113, p. 140.)

  Þe fowel þat hyȝt voltor þat etiþ þe stomak or þe giser of ticius.

    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 107.)


XI. THE MUTABILITY OF FORTUNE.

  For if hire (Fortune’s) whiel stynte any thinge to torne
  Thanne cessed she Fortune anon to be.

(Compare stanzas 120, 121, p. 142, and stanza 136, p. 146, of ‘Troylus
and Cryseyde’ with pp. 31, 33, 35, and p. 34 of Chaucer’s Boethius.)

    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. prose 4.)

  Anxia enim res est humanorum conditio bonorum, et quæ vel nunquam

    (_Ib._)

  O, brotel wele of mannes joie unstable!
  With what wight so thow be, or how thow pleye,
  Oither he woot that thow joie art muable,
  Or woot it nought, it mot ben on of tweyen:

  That he hath veray joie and selynesse,
  That is of ignoraunce ay in distresse?

  The drede of lesyng maketh hym that he

  And if to lese his joie, he sette not a myte,
  Than semeth it, that joie is worth ful lite.

XIII. FORTUNE.

         ----Fortune

  And, when a wight is from hire whiel ithrowe,

    (_Troylus and Cryseyde_, bk. iii. st. 254, vol. iv. p. 299.)

  She (Fortune) vseþ ful flatryng familarité wiþ hem þat she
  enforceþ to bygyle.

    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 30.)

  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  She lauȝeþ and scorneþ þe wepyng of hem þe
  whiche she haþ maked wepe wiþ hir free wille  .  .  .  . Yif þat a
  wyȝt is seyn weleful and ouerþrowe in an houre.

    (_Ib._ p. 33.)

In book v., stanza 260, vol. v. p. 75, Chaucer describes how the soul of
Hector, after his death, ascended ‘up to the holughnesse of the seventhe
spere.’ In so doing he seems to have had before him met. 1, book 4, of
Boethius, where the ‘soul’ is described as passing into the heaven’s
utmost sphere, and looking down on the world below. See _Chaucer’s
Boethius_, p. 110, 111.

Ætas Prima is of course a metrical version of lib. ii. met. 5.

Hampole speaks of the wonderful sight of the Lynx; perhaps he was
indebted to Boethius for the hint. --(See _Boethius_, book 3, pr. 8,
p. 81.)

I have seen the following elsewhere:

  (1) Value not beauty, for it may be destroyed by a three days’
  fever.

    (See _Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 81.)

  (2) There is no greater plague than the enmity of thy familiar
  friend.

    (See _Chaucer’s_ translation, p. 77.)

       *       *       *       *       *

Chaucer did not English Boethius second-hand, through any early French
version, as some have supposed, but made his translation with the Latin
original before him.

Jean de Méung’s version, the only early French translation, perhaps,
accessible to Chaucer, is not always literal, while the present
translation is seldom free or periphrastic, but conforms closely to the
Latin, and is at times awkwardly literal. A few passages, taken
haphazard, will make this sufficiently clear.

Many of the above examples are very bald renderings of the original, and
are only quoted here to show that Chaucer did not make his translation
from the French.

Chaucer is not always felicitous in his translations:--thus he
translates _clavus atque gubernaculum_ by _keye and a stiere_ (p. 103),
and _compendium_ (gain, acquisition) by _abreggynge_ (abridging,
curtailment), p. 151. Many terms make their appearance in English for
the first time,--and most of them have become naturalized, and are such
as we could ill spare. Some few are rather uncommon, as _gouernaile_
(gubernaculum), p. 27; _arbitre_ (arbitrium), p. 154. As Chaucer takes
the trouble to explain _inestimable_ (inæstimabilis), p. 158, it could
not have been a very familiar term.

Our translator evidently took note of various readings, for on p. 31 he
notes a variation of the original. On p. 51 he uses _armurers_
(= armures) to render _arma_, though most copies agree in reading
_arva_.

There are numerous glosses and explanations of particular passages,
which seem to be interpolated by Chaucer himself. Thus he explains what
is meant by the _heritage of Socrates_ (p. 10, 11); he gives the
meaning of _coemption_ (p. 15); of _Euripus_ (p. 33); of the _porch_
(p. 166).[I-11] Some of his definitions are very quaint; as, for
instance, that of Tragedy--‘_a dité of a prosperité for a tyme þat endiþ
in wrechednesse_’ (p. 35). One would think that the following definition
of Tragedian would be rather superfluous after this,--‘_a maker of dites
þat hyȝten_ (are called) _tregedies_’ (p. 77).

  _Melliflui . . . oris Homerus_

is thus quaintly Englished: _Homer wiþ þe hony mouþe, þat is to seyn.
homer wiþ þe swete dites_ (p. 153).

       *       *       *       *       *

The present translation of the _De Consolatione_ is taken from
Additional MS. 10,340, which is supposed to be the _oldest_ manuscript
that exists in our public libraries. After it was all copied out and
ready for press, Mr Bradshaw was kind enough to procure me, for the
purpose of collation, the loan of the Camb. University MS. Ii. 3. 21,
from which the various readings at the foot of the pages are taken.

Had I had an opportunity of examining the Cambridge MS. carefully
throughout before the work was so far advanced, I should certainly have
selected it in preference to the text now given to the reader. Though
not so ancient as the British Museum MS., it is far more correct in its
grammatical inflexions, and is no doubt a copy of an older and very
accurate text.

The Additional MS. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the
force of the final _-e_. Thus he adds it to the preterites of strong
verbs, which do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak
verbs where it is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles (of
weak verbs), where it is superfluous. The scribe of the Cambridge MS. is
careful to preserve the final _-e_ where it is a sign (1) of the
definite declension of the adjective; (2) of the plural adjective;
(3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of the preterite of weak verbs; (5) of
present participles;[I-12] (6) of the 2nd pers. pret. indic. of strong
verbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older vowel ending.

The Addit. MS. has frequently _thilk_ (singular and plural), and _-nes_
(in _wrechednes_, &c.), when the Camb. MS. has _thilke_[I-13] and
_-nesse_.

For further differences the reader may consult the numerous collations
at the foot of the page.

If the Chaucer Society obtains that amount of patronage from the
literary public which it deserves, but unfortunately has yet not
succeeded in getting, so that it may be enabled to go on with the great
work which has been so successfully commenced, then the time may come
when I shall have the opportunity of editing the Camb. MS. of Chaucer’s
Boethius for that Society, and lovers of Early English Literature will
have two texts instead of one.

    159.]

    _-yngë_.]

    [Footnote I-13: It is nearly always _thilkë_ in the Canterbury
    Tales.]




APPENDIX TO INTRODUCTION.


The last of the ancients, and one who forms a link between the classical
period of literature and that of the middle ages, in which he was a
favourite author, is Boethius, a man of fine genius, and interesting
both from his character and his death. It is well known that after
filling the dignities of Consul and Senator in the court of Theodoric,
he fell a victim to the jealousy of a sovereign, from whose memory, in
many respects glorious, the stain of that blood has never been effaced.
The _Consolation of Philosophy_, the chief work of Boethius, was written
in his prison. Few books are more striking from the circumstances of
their production. Last of the classic writers, in style not impure,
though displaying too lavishly that poetic exuberance which had
distinguished the two or three preceding centuries, in elevation of
sentiment equal to any of the philosophers, and mingling a Christian
sanctity with their lessons, he speaks from his prison in the swan-like
tones of dying eloquence. The philosophy that consoled him in bonds, was
soon required in the sufferings of a cruel death. Quenched in his blood,
the lamp he had trimmed with a skilful hand gave no more light; the
language of Tully and Virgil soon ceased to be spoken; and many ages
were to pass away, before learned diligence restored its purity, and the
union of genius with imitation taught a few modern writers to surpass in
eloquence the Latinity of Boethius. --(Hallam’s _Literature of Europe_,
i. 2, 4th ed. 1854.)

The Senator Boethius is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could
have acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy orphan, he
inherited the patrimony and honours of the Anician family, a name
ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the
appellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a
race of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the
Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the Republic. In
the youth of Boethius the studies of Rome were not totally abandoned; a
Virgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the
professors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in
their privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the
erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his ardent
curiosity; and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious
years in the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the
learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples. The reason and
piety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion of
mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the Academy, but he
imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method, of his dead and living
masters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtle sense of
Aristotle with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.
After his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his
friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a palace
of ivory and [glass] to prosecute the same studies. The Church was
edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian,
the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the Catholic unity was
explained or exposed in a formal treatise by the _indifference_ of three
distinct though consubstantial persons. For the benefit of his Latin
readers, his genius submitted to teach the first elements of the arts
and sciences of Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras,
the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy
of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with the
commentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the
indefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he alone was esteemed
capable of describing the wonders of art, a sun-dial, a water-clock, or
a sphere which represented the motions of the planets. From these
abstruse speculations, Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he
rose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were
relieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might
compare to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in
the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was felt and
rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius was adorned
with the titles of consul and patrician, and his talents were usefully
employed in the important station of master of the offices.
Notwithstanding the equal claims of the East and West, his two sons were
created, in their tender youth, the consuls of the same year. On the
memorable day of their inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from
their palace to the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people;
and their joyful father, the true Consul of Rome, after pronouncing an
oration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a triumphal
largess in the games of the circus. Prosperous in his fame and fortunes,
in his public honours and private alliances, in the cultivation of
science and the consciousness of virtue, Boethius might have been styled
happy, if that precarious epithet could be safely applied before the
last term of the life of man.

A philosopher, liberal of his wealth and parsimonious of his time, might
be insensible to the common allurements of ambition, the thirst of gold
and employment. And some credit may be due to the asseveration of
Boethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the divine Plato, who enjoins
every virtuous citizen to rescue the state from the usurpation of vice
and ignorance. For the integrity of his public conduct he appeals to the
memory of his country. His authority had restrained the pride and
oppression of the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered
Paulianus from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often
relieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were exhausted
by public and private rapine; and Boethius alone had courage to oppose
the tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by conquest, excited by avarice,
and, as he complains, encouraged by impunity. In these honourable
contests his spirit soared above the consideration of danger, and
perhaps of prudence; and we may learn from the example of Cato, that a
character of pure and inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by
prejudice, to be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities
with public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the
infirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the mildest
form of a Gothic kingdom, even the weight of allegiance and gratitude,
must be insupportable to the free spirit of a Roman patriot. But the
favour and fidelity of Boethius declined in just proportion with the
public happiness; and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and
control the power of the master of the offices. In the last gloomy
season of Theodoric, he indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his
master had only power over his life, he stood without arms and without
fear against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to
believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his own. The
Senator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the presumption of
_hoping_, as it was said, the liberty of Rome.

“If Albinus be criminal,” exclaimed the orator, “the senate and myself
are all guilty of the same crime. If we are innocent, Albinus is equally
entitled to the protection of the laws.” These laws might not have
punished the simple and barren wish of an unattainable blessing; but
they would have shown less indulgence to the rash confession of
Boethius, that, had he known of a conspiracy, the tyrant never should.
The advocate of Albinus was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the
guilt of his client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery)
was affixed to the original address, inviting the emperor to deliver
Italy from the Goths; and three witnesses of honourable rank, perhaps of
infamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs of the Roman
patrician. Yet his innocence must be presumed, since he was deprived by
Theodoric of the means of justification, and rigorously confined in the
tower of Pavia, while the senate, at the distance of five hundred miles,
pronounced a sentence of confiscation and death against the most
illustrious of its members. At the command of the Barbarians, the occult
science of a philosopher was stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and
magic. A devout and dutiful attachment to the senate was condemned as
criminal by the trembling voices of the senators themselves; and their
ingratitude deserved the wish or prediction of Boethius, that, after
him, none should be found guilty of the same offence.

While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the
sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the
_Consolation of Philosophy_; a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure
of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the
barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The celestial
guide, whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended
to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his
wounds her salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity
and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy
of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her
gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed
them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly
disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness,
since they had left him virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended to
heaven in search of the SUPREME GOOD; explored the metaphysical
labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and free-will, of time
and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect
attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and
physical government. Such topics of consolation, so obvious, so vague,
or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature.
Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labour of thought;
and the sage who could artfully combine in the same work the various
riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed
the intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of
evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed,
and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord
was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened till his
eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered
in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired. But his
genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of
the Latin world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the
most glorious of the English kings, and the third emperor of the name of
Otho removed to a more honourable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,
who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honours of martyrdom
and the fame of miracles. In the last hours of Boethius, he derived some
comfort from the safety of his two sons, of his wife, and of his
father-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the grief of Symmachus was
indiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to lament, he
might dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was dragged in
chains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of
Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged
senator.--Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall_, 1838, vol. vii. p. 45-52 (without
the notes).

    times when she raised her head higher than the heavens.]

    folly, and by her help Socrates triumphed over an unjust death.]

    and Stoics wanted to get a part.]

    [Sidenote: Philosophy withstood them, whereupon they tore her
    robe, and, departing with the shreds, imagined that they had got
    possession of her.]

          ¶ Þei

    laboured under difficulties on account of being her disciples.]

    [Sidenote: It is the aim of Philosophy to displease the wicked,
    who are more to be despised than dreaded, for they have no
    leader.]

    [Sidenote: If Philosophy is attacked by the wicked, she retires
    within her fortress, leaving the enemy busy among the useless
    baggage, and laughing to scorn such hunters of trifles.]

          ¶ And if þei somtyme                                       220

    patiently the injuries offered him.]

    obtained, leaves nothing more to be desired.]

          [And blysfulnesse] is swiche a goode

    that this good lies in the _reverence_ and _esteem_ of their
    fellow men, strive to acquire honourable positions.]

    which are falsely supposed capable of satisfying our desires?]

    affirmed than this.]

    [Sidenote: Turn your mind’s eye upon the reverse of all this
    _false felicity_ and you will perceive _the true happiness_.]

  þe causes of þe false blysfulnesse

    [Sidenote: True felicity consists in a state of sufficiency, of
    power, and honour--as well as of a shining reputation and every
    desirable pleasure: and I must confess that true felicity is that
    which is bestowed by these advantages, as they are in reality all
    one and the same.]

          ¶ For but yif I be by-giled.

    conviction, provided you add but one limitation.]

  _P._ O my nurry q{uod} she by þis oppiniou{n} q{uo}d she I

    [Sidenote: _B._ What is that?]

          what is þat q{uo}d .I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Thinkest thou that any thing in this world can
    confer this happiness? (the sovereign good).]

          ¶ Trowest þou þat                                         2388

    such a state of perfection.]

          Certys q{uo}d I trowe it nat.
  {and} þou hast shewed me wel þat ouer þilke goode þer
  is no þing more to ben desired.

    [Sidenote: _P._ These imperfect things above mentioned only confer
    the shadow of the supreme good, or at most only an imperfect
    felicity, but they cannot bestow true and perfect happiness.]

          _P._ þise þinges þan                                      2392

    [Sidenote: _B._ I quite agree with you.]

  _boice._ I. accorde me wel q{uo}d .I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Then, knowing the difference between true and
    false felicity you must now learn where to look for this supreme
    felicity.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ But, as Plato says that even in the least things
    the Divine assistance ought to be implored, what ought we do, to
    render us worthy of so important a discovery as the true source
    and seat of the sovereign good?]

          ¶ But for as

    [Sidenote: Nature takes not her origin from things diminished and
    imperfect; but, proceeding from an entire and absolute substance,
    descends into the remotest and most fruitless things.]

  ¶ For þe nature of þinges ne token nat her bygynnyng

    then He who has no equal in goodness must be good.]

  god. it may nat ben douted þan þat [he þ{a}t] no þing is

    (2) that the sovereign good exists in him.]

    [Sidenote: If it were not so He could not be the Ruler of all
    things, for there would be some other being excelling him who
    possesses the supreme good and who must have existed before Him.]

  souereyne p{er}fit goode.                                    [[pg 90]]

    [Sidenote: And as we have seen that the perfect good is true
    happiness, it follows that the true felicity resides in the
    Supreme Divinity.]

          and we han establissed þat þe
  souereyne goode is verrey blisfulnesse. þan mot it nedes
  ben [þ{a}t verray blysfulnesse is] yset i{n} souereyne god.       2500
  _B._ þis take I wel q{uo}d .I. ne þis ne may nat be wiþseid
  in no manere.

    [Sidenote: But let us see how we can firmly and irrefragably prove
    that the Supreme God contains in his own nature a plenitude of
    perfect and consummate good.]

          ¶ But I p{re}ie þe q{uo}d she see now how
  þou mayst preuen holily {and} wiþ-oute{n} corrupciou{n} þis
  þat I haue seid. þat þe souereyne god is ryȝt ful of              2504
  souereyne goode. [In whych man{er}e q{uo}d I.] wenest
  þou ouȝt q{uo}d she þat þis p{r}ince of alle þinges haue
  ytake þilke souereyne good any where þan of hym self.
  ¶ of whiche souereyne goode men p{ro}ueþ þat he is ful            2508
  ryȝt as þou myȝtest þinken. þat god þat haþ blisfulnesse
  in hym self. {and} þat ilke blisfulnesse þat is in hym
  were diu{er}s in substaunce.

    [Sidenote: If you think that God has received this good from
    without, then you must believe that the giver of this good is more
    excellent than God the receiver.]

          ¶ For yif þou wene þat
  god haue receyued þilke good oute of hy{m} self. þou              2512
  mayst wene þat he þat ȝaf þilke good to god. be more
  goode þan is god.

    [Sidenote: But we have concluded that there is nothing more
    excellent than God.]

          ¶ But I am byknowen {and} confesse
  {and} þat ryȝt dignely þat god is ryȝt worþi abouen alle
  þinges.

    [Sidenote: But if this supreme good is in Him by nature, and is
    nevertheless of a different substance, we cannot conceive, since
    God is the author of all things, what could have united these two
    substances differing one from another.]

          ¶ And yif so be þat þis good be in hym by                 2516
  nature. but þat it is diu{er}s from [hym] by wenyng
  resou{n}. syn we speke of god p{r}ince of alle þinges feyne
  who so feyne may. who was he þat [hath] co{n}ioigned
  þise diu{er}s þinges to-gidre.

    [Sidenote: Lastly, a thing which essentially differs from another
    cannot be the same with that from which it is supposed to differ.]

          {and} eke at þe last[e] se                                2520
  wel þat o þing þat is diu{er}s from any þing. þat þilke
  þing nis nat þat same þing. fro whiche it is vndirstonde{n}
  to ben diu{er}s.

    [Sidenote: Consequently, what in its nature differs from the chief
    good cannot be the supreme good.]

          þan folweþ it. þat þilke þi{n}g þat
  by hys nature is dyuers from souereyne good. þat þat              2524
  þing nys nat souereyne good.

    [Sidenote: But it would be impious and profane thus to conceive of
    God, since nothing can excel Him in goodness and worth.]

          but certys þat were a
  felonous corsednesse to þinken þat of hym. þat no þing
  nis more worþe.

    [Sidenote: In fact, nothing can exist whose nature is better than
    its origin.]

          For alwey of alle þinges. þe nat{ur}e

    is really and substantially the supreme Good.]

  ¶ For whiche I may concluden by ryȝt uerray resou{n}.        [[pg 91]]
  þat þilke þat is bygynnyng of alle þinges. þilke same
  þing is good in his substaunce.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Most rightly said!]

          _B._ þou hast seid ryȝtfully
  q{uo}d .I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ But you have owned that true felicity is the
    sovereign good; then you must also grant that God is that true
    felicity.]

          _P._ But we han graunted q{uo}d she þat                   2532
  souereyne good is blysfulnes. þat is soþe q{uo}d .I. þan
  q{uo}d she mote we nedes graunten {and} confessen þat
  þilke same souereyne goode be god.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Your conclusions follow from your premises.]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 21 _b_.]]

          ¶ Certys *q{uo}d
  .I. I ne may nat denye ne wiþstonde þe resou{n}s p{ur}posed.      2536
  and I see wel þat it folweþ by strengþe of þe
  p{re}misses.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Let us see whether we cannot prove this more
    convincingly by considering it in this view, that there cannot be
    two sovereign goods which differ in themselves.]

          ¶ Loke nowe q{uo}d she yif þis be proued

  self.

    [Sidenote: For it is plain that of the goods that differ one
    cannot be what the other is; wherefore neither of them can be
    perfect where one wants the other.]

          þat on is nat þat þat oþer is. þan [ne] mowen
  neiþer of hem ben p{er}fit. so as eyþer of hem lakkiþ to

    [Sidenote: That which is not perfect cannot be the supreme good.]

          but þat þat nis nat p{er}fit men may seen apertly
  þat it nis nat souereyne.

    [Sidenote: Neither can the chief good be essentially different.]

          þe þinges þan þat ben                                     2544

    [Sidenote: But it has been shown that God and happiness are the
    chief good, wherefore the sovereign felicity and the Supreme
    Divinity are one and the same.]

  ¶ But I haue wel conclude þat blisfulnesse {and} god ben
  [the] souereyne goode. For whiche it mot nedes be þat
  souereyne blisfulnesse is souerey[ne] dyuynite. ¶ No              2548

    [Sidenote: Following then the examples of geometricians who deduce
    their consequences from their propositions, I shall deduce to thee
    something like a corollary as follows:--]

    [Sidenote: Because by the attainment of felicity men become happy,
    and as felicity is the same as Divinity itself, therefore by the
    attainment of Divinity men are made happy.]

          For whi.
  for as moche as by þe getynge of blisfulnesse men ben             2556

    THE HAPPY MAN IS A GOD.]

    only _One_; but by participation of Divine essence there may be
    many gods.]

          þan is euery blisful

    [Sidenote: But as happiness seems to be an assemblage of many
    things, ought we not to consider whether these several things
    constitute conjointly the body of happiness, or whether there is
    not some one of these particular things that may complete the
    substance or essence of it, and to which all the rest have a
    relation?]

          ¶ So q{uo}d she as

          ¶ I wolde q{uo}d I þat þou
  makedest me clerly to vndirstonde what þou seist. {and}
  þat þou recordest me þe forseide þinges.

    [Sidenote: _P._ As you grant that happiness is a good, you may say
    the same of all the other goods; for perfect sufficiency is
    identical with supreme felicity; so is supreme power, likewise
    high rank, a shining reputation, and perfect pleasure.]

          ¶ Haue I nat                                              2580

    they were, happiness might be made up of one member--which is
    absurd and impossible.]

          ¶ For þerfore

    they cannot be more desirable than the good itself.]

    good and happiness are essentially the same.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ Have I not shown that the things which the
    majority of mankind so eagerly pursue are not true and perfect
    goods, for they differ from one another; and because where one of
    them is absent the others cannot confer absolute happiness (or
    good)?]

          ¶ Haue I nat shewed þe q{uo}d

  {and} absolute.

    [Sidenote: Have I not shown, too, that the true and chief good is
    made up of an assemblage of all the goods in such a way, that if
    sufficiency is an attribute of this good, it must at the same time
    possess power, reverence, &c.]

          ¶ But þan atte arst ben þei verray good

    [Sidenote: While these things differ from one another they are not
    goods; but as soon as they become one then they are made
    goods.--Do not they owe their being good to their unity?]

    UNITY NECESSARY TO EXISTENCE.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ Then you must own that unity and good are the same
    (for the substance of those things must be the same, whose effects
    do not naturally differ).]

  ¶ þan mayst þou graunt[en] it q{uo}d she by sembleable

    [Sidenote: _P._ Do you not perceive that everything which exists
    is permanent so long as it preserves its unity--but as soon as it
    loses this, it is dissolved and annihilated?]

          ¶ Hast þou nat knowen wel q{uo}d

  ¶ In whiche manere q{uo}d .I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ In the animal creation as long as the soul and the
    body are united and conjoined in one, this being is called an
    animal or beast, but when the union is dissolved by the separation
    of these, the animal perishes and is no longer a beast.]

          ¶ Ryȝt as in

    [Sidenote: The same may be said of man and all other things; they
    subsist while unity is preserved, but as soon as that is destroyed
    the things themselves lose their existence.]

          {and} þe

    [Sidenote: _B._ I do not find any creature endowed with volition,
    which, of itself and without constraint, renounces or despises
    life and self-preservation or willingly hastens to destruction.]

  ¶ yif I considere q{uod} I þe beestes þat han

    [Sidenote: But with regard to herbs and trees, I am doubtful
    whether I ought to have the same opinion of them, for they have no
    sensitive soul, nor any natural volition like animals.]

  _b._ but certys I doute me of herbes {and} of trees. þat is       2724

    [Sidenote: Herbs and trees first choose a convenient place to grow
    in, where, agreeably to their respective natures, they are sure to
    thrive, and are in no danger of perishing; for some grow on
    plains, some on mountains, &c.; and if you try to transplant them,
    they forthwith wither and die.]

    plants by a multiplicity of seeds, which are as a foundation for a
    building, not to remain for a time, but as it were for ever.]

    [Sidenote: For the will, induced by powerful reasons, sometimes
    chooses and embraces death, although nature dreads and abhors it.]

    [Sidenote: And, on the contrary, we see that concupiscence (by
    which alone the human race is perpetuated) is often restrained by
    the will.]

    product of volition, but proceeds from a natural impression or
    intention of nature.]

    [Sidenote: _B._ Nothing is more true. For either all things must
    be reduced to nothing (or have no relation to anything else), and,
    destitute of a head, float about without control or order; or if
    there be anything to which all things tend, that must be the
    supreme good.]

  [Sidenote: [The .12. p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: _B._ I am quite of Plato’s opinion, for you have now a
    second time recalled these things to my remembrance which had been
    forgotten, first by the contagious union of soul and body, and
    afterwards by the pressure of my afflictions.]

  ++THanne seide I thus // I acorde me gretly to plato / for
  thow remenbrist {and} recordist me thise thinges yit]

    [Sidenote: [*_Addit. MS. 10,340, fol. 23._]]

  *þe seconde tyme. þat is to seyn. first whan I lost[e] my

    [Sidenote: _P._ If you will reflect upon the concessions you have
    already made, you will soon call to mind that truth, of which you
    lately confessed your ignorance.]

  ¶ And þan sayde she þus. ¶ If þou look[e] q{uo}d she

    [Sidenote: _P._ It was, by what power the world is governed.]

  ¶ by whiche gouerme{n}t q{uo}d she þat þis worlde is

    [Sidenote: _B._ With regard to that, I own I confessed my
    ignorance, but though I now remotely see what you infer, yet I
    wish for further explanation from you.]

          Me remembriþ it wel q{uo}d I. {and} I confesse            2884

    my reasons for this belief.]

  ¶ Certys q{uo}d I ne ȝitte doute I it nauȝt. ne I nil

    [Sidenote: The discordant elements of this world would never have
    assumed their present form unless there had been a wise
    Intelligence to unite them; and even after such a union, the
    joining of such opposites would have disunited and ruined the
    fabric made up of them, had not the same conjoining hand kept them
    together.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ I have shown that God is the chief good; God must,
    therefore, direct and order all things by _good_, since he governs
    them by himself, whom we have proved to be the _supreme good_, and
    he is that helm and rudder, by which this machine of the world is

*INCIPIT LIBER QUARTUS.


HEC CUM PHILOSOPHIA DIGNITATE UULT{US}.

  [Sidenote: [The 1^ma p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: When P. with grace and dignity had poured forth her
    songs, I, not quite quit of my load of grief, interrupted her as
    she was continuing her discourse.]

  ++Whanne philosophie hadde songe{n} softly {and} delitably
  þe forseide þinges kepynge þe dignitee of hir
  choere in þe weyȝte of hir wordes. I þan þat ne hadde             3080
  nat al out{er}ly forȝeten þe wepyng {and} mournyng
  þat was set in myne herte for-brek þe entenc{i}ou{n} of hir
  þat entended[e] ȝitte to seyne oþ{er} þinges.

    [Sidenote: All your discourses, O my conductress to the true
    light! have been very clear and unanswerable, both by the divine
    testimony which they carry along with them, and by thy
    irrefragable arguments.]

          ¶ Se q{uo}d
  I. þou þat art gideresse of verray lyȝte þe þinges þat þou        3084
  hast seid [me] hider to ben to me so clere
                  {and} so shewyng                            [[pg 109]]
  by þe deuyne lokyng of hem {and} by þi resou{n}s þat
  þei ne mowe nat ben ouercomen.

    [Sidenote: Through the oppression of grief I had forgotten these
    truths, but was not wholly ignorant of them.]

          ¶ And þilke þi{n}g{us}
  þat þou toldest me. al be it so þat I hadde som tyme              3088
  fo[r]ȝeten hem for [the] sorwe of þe wronge þat haþ ben
  don to me. ȝit naþeles þei ne were nat alouterly vnknowen
  to me.

    [Sidenote: The principal cause of my trouble is this--that, whilst
    the absolute Ruler of all things is goodness itself, evil exists
    and is allowed to pass unpunished.]

          but þis same is namly a gret cause of
  my sorwe. þat so as þe gouernoure of þinges is goode.             3092
  yif þat yuelys mowen ben by any weyes. or ellys yif
  þat yuelys passen wiþ outen punyssheinge.

    [Sidenote: This, to say the least, is astonishing.]

          þe whiche
  þinge oonly how worþi it is to ben wondred vpon. þou
  considerest it weel þi self certeynly.

    [Sidenote: Moreover, while _vice_ flourishes _virtue_ is not only
    unrewarded, but trampled under foot by base and profligate men,
    and suffers the punishment due to impiety.]

          but ȝitte to þis                                          3096
  þing þere is an oþer þing y-ioigned more to ben ywondred
  vpon. ¶ For felonie is emperisse {and} flowreþ ful of
  rycchesse. and vertues nis nat al oonly wiþ outen medes.
  but it is cast vndir {and} fortroden vndir þe feet of felonous    3100
  folk. {and} it abieþ þe to{ur}me{n}tes in sted of
  wicked felou{n}s

    [Sidenote: Here is cause for wonderment, since such things are
    possible under the government of an omniscient and omnipotent God,
    who wills nothing but what is the best.]

          ¶ Of al[le] whiche þing þer nis no wyȝt
  þat [may] merueyllen ynouȝ ne compleyne þat swiche
  þinges ben don in þe regne of god þat alle þinges woot.           3104
  and alle þinges may {and} ne wool nat but only goode
  þinges.

    [Sidenote: _P._ It were indeed, not only marvellous, but also
    horribly monstrous, if, in the well-regulated family of so great a
    master, the worthless vessels should be honoured and the precious
    ones be despised:--but it is not so.]

          ¶ þan seide she þus. certys q{uo}d she þat were
  a grete meruayle {and} an enbaissynge wiþouten ende.
  {and} wel more horrible þan alle monstres yif it were as          3108
  þ{o}u wenest. þat is to sein. þat in þe ryȝt ordeyne house
  of so mochel a fader {and} an ordenour of meyne. þat þe
  vesseles þat ben foule {and} vyle sholde ben hono{ur}ed
  {and} heried. and þe p{re}cious uesseles sholde ben defouled      3112
  {and} vyle. but it nis nat so.

    [Sidenote: For if the conclusions we have come to, be sound and
    irrefragable, we must confess that under God’s rule the _good_ are
    always powerful and mighty, and the _wicked_ weak and
    contemptible;]

          For yif þe þinges
  þat I haue co{n}cluded a litel here byforne ben kept hoole  [[pg 110]]
  {and} vnraced. þou shalt wel knowe by þe auctorite of
  god. of þe whos regne I speke þat certys þe good[e]               3116
  folk ben alwey myȝty. {and} shrewes ben alwey yuel {and}
  feble.

    [Sidenote: that vice never passes unpunished, nor virtue goes
    unrewarded;]

          ne þe vices ben neu{e}re mo wiþ outen peyne[;] ne
  þe vertues ne ben nat wiþ outen mede.

    [Sidenote: that happiness attends good men, and misfortune falls
    to the lot of the wicked.]

          and þat blisfulnesses
  comen alwey to goode folke. {and} infortune comeþ                 3120
  alwey to wicked folke.

    [Sidenote: These and many other truths of like nature shall be
    proved to thee, and shall put an end to thy complaints, and
    strengthen thee with firmness and solidity.]

          ¶ And þou shalt wel knowe
  many[e] þinges of þis kynde þ{a}t sholle cessen þi pleyntes.
  {and} stedfast þe wiþ stedfast saddenesse.

    [Sidenote: Having shown you a picture of true felicity, and
    wherein it resides, I shall now trace out the way which will lead
    you to your home.]

          ¶ And for þou
  hast seyn þe forme of þe verray blisfulnesse by me þat            3124
  [haue] somtyme I-shewed it þe. And þou hast knowen
  i{n} whom blysfulnesse is set. alle þinges I treted þ{a}t I
  trowe ben nessessarie to put[te] furþe ¶ I shal shewe
  þe. þe weye þat shal brynge þe aȝeyne vnto þi house               3128

    [Sidenote: I will give your soul wings to soar aloft, so that all
    tribulation being removed, you may, under my guiding, by my road,
    and with my vehicle, return whole and sound into your own
    country.]

  {and} I shal ficche feþeres in þi þouȝt by whiche it may
  arysen in heyȝte. so þat al tribulac{i}ou{n} don awey þou

    POWER, AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE CHIEF GOOD.]

    [Sidenote: For as evil is nothing, it is clear that while the
    wicked can only do evil they can do nothing.]

  ¶ For so as I haue gadered {and} p{ro}ued a lytel her byforn

    [Sidenote: That you may understand the force of this power, I have
    proved that nothing is more powerful than the sovereign good.]

          and for as
  moche as þou vndirstonde whiche is þe strengþe þat is
  power of shrewes. I haue diffinised a lytel here byforn

    [Sidenote: _B._ No sane man can think so.]

  No man q{uo}d .I. but yif he be out of hys witte.

          ¶ ȝe wolde
  god q{uo}d I þat þei ne myȝte{n} don none.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Since he that can do good, can do all things, and
    he that has power to do evil cannot do all things, therefore the
    evil-doers are less powerful.]

          þat q{uo}d she
  so as he þat is myȝty to done oonly but good[e] þinges
  may don alle þinges. and þei þat ben myȝty to done                3336

  þing {and} manifest þat þei þ{a}t mowe{n} don yuel ben of

    [Sidenote: Let me add too that _power_ is one of the things to be
    desired, and that all such things are to be referred to the chief
    good (the perfection of their nature).]

          and ȝitte to p{ro}ue þis conclusiou{n} þere

  desired ben referred to good ryȝt as to a manere heyȝte
  of hyr nature.

    [Sidenote: But the power of doing evil has no relation to that
    Good, therefore it is not desirable; but as all power is
    desirable, it is clear that the ability to do evil is not power.]

          ¶ But for to mowen don yuel {and}                         3344

    only are powerful while the vicious are feeble.]

    only have the power to do what they desire; the wicked may follow
    the dictates of their lusts, but their great aim and desire,
    _i. e._ HAPPINESS, they can never attain.]

          ¶ And it is clere {and} open þat þilke

    [Sidenote: The wicked may gratify their desires, thinking to
    attain the chief good (for which they wish), but they can never
    possess it, for impiety and vice can never be crowned with
    happiness.]

    all good men are happy in as much as they are good; but if they

    HE WHO CEASES TO BE VIRTUOUS CEASES TO BE A MAN.]

    lose their human nature.]

    [Sidenote: But as virtue alone exalts one man above other men, it
    is evident that vice, which divests a man of his nature, must sink
    him below humanity.]

  [Sidenote: [The 3^de Met{ur}.]]

    [Sidenote: Ulysses was driven by the eastern winds upon the shores
    of that isle where Circe dwelt, who, having entertained her guests
    with magic draughts, transformed them into divers shapes--one into
    a boar, another into a lion;]

  ++Evrus þe wynde aryueþ þe sayles of vlixes duc of þe

    [Sidenote: But Mercury, the Arcadian god, rescued Ulysses from the
    Circean charms. Yet his mariners, having drunk of her infected
    drinks, were changed to swine, and fed on acorns.]

          but al be it so þat þe

    bereft of speech.]

    THE WICKED ARE TORMENTED BY A THREEFOLD WRETCHEDNESS.]

TUNC EGO FATEOR INQ{UA}M.

  [Sidenote: [The ferthe p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: _B._ I confess that vicious men are rightly called
    beasts.]

  ++Þan seide I þus I confesse {and} am aknowe q{uo}d I. ne
  I ne se nat þat men may seyn as by ryȝt.

    [Sidenote: They retain the outward form of man, but the qualities
    of their souls prove them to be beasts.]

          þ{a}t
  shrewes ne ben nat chaunged in to beestes by þe
  qualite of hir soules. ¶ Al be it so þ{a}t þei kepen ȝitte        3520
  þe forme of þe body of mankynde.

    [Sidenote: I wish, however, that the wicked were without the power
    to annoy and hurt good men.]

          but I nolde nat of
  shrewes of whiche þe þouȝt cruel woodeþ alwey in to
  destrucc{i}ou{n} of good[e] men. þat it wer{e} leueful to hem
  to done þat.

    [Sidenote: _P._ They have no power, as I shall presently show
    you.]

          ¶ Certys q{uo}d she ne it nis nat leueful                 3524
  to hem as I shal wel shewen þe in couenable place.

    [Sidenote: But were this power, which men ascribe to them, taken
    away from the wicked, they would be relieved of the greatest part
    of their punishment.]

  ¶ But naþeles yif so were þat þilke þat me{n} wene{n} ben
  leueful for shrewes were bynomen hem. so þat þei ne         [[pg 124]]
  myȝten nat anoyen or don harme to goode men. ¶ Certys             3528
  a gret p{ar}ty of þe peyne to shrewes shulde ben allegged
  {and} releued.

    [Sidenote: The wicked are more unhappy when they have accomplished
    their evil designs than when they fail to do so.]

          ¶ For al be it so þ{a}t þis ne seme nat
  credible þing p{er}auent{ur}e to so{m}me folk ȝit mot it
  nedes be þat shrewes ben more wrecches {and} vnsely.              3532
  whan þei may don {and} p{er}forme þat þei coueiten [than
  yif they myhte nat complyssen þ{a}t they coueyten].

    [Sidenote: If it is a miserable thing to will evil, it is a
    greater unhappiness to have the power to execute it, without which
    power the wicked desires would languish without effect.]

          ¶ For
  yif so be þat it be wrecchednesse to wilne to don yuel[;]
  þan is it more wrecchednesse to mowen don yuel.                   3536
  wiþ oute whiche moeuyng þe wrecched wille sholde
  languisshe wiþ oute effecte.

    [Sidenote: Since, then, each of these three things (_i. e._ the
    will, the power, and the accomplishment of evil) hath its misery,
    therefore a threefold wretchedness afflicts those who both will,
    can, and do commit sin.]

          ¶ þan syn þat eueryche of
  þise þinges haþ hys wrecchednesse. þat is to seyne wil
  to done yuel. and moeuynge to done yuel. it mot nedes             3540
  be. þat þei (shrewes) ben constreyned by þre vnselynesses
  þat wolen {and} mowen {and} p{er}formen felonyes
  {and} shrewednesses.

    [Sidenote: _B._ I grant it--but still I wish the vicious were
    without this misfortune.]

          ¶ I accorde me q{uo}d I. but I
  desire gretely þat shrewes losten sone þilke vnselynesses.        3544
  þat is to seyne þat shrewes were despoyled of moeuyng
  to don yuel.

    [Sidenote: _P._ They shall be despoiled of it sooner than you wish
    perhaps, or than they themselves imagine.]

          ¶ so shulle{n} þei q{uo}d she.

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 28.]]

          sonnere
  p{er}auenture þen þ{o}u woldest *or sonnere þen þei hem
  self wenen to lakken mowynge to done yuel.

    [Sidenote: In the narrow limits of this life, nothing, however
    tardy it appears, can seem to an immortal soul to have a very long
    duration.]

          ¶ For                                                     3548
  þere nis no þing so late in so short bou{n}des of þis lijf
  þat is longe to abide. namelyche to a corage inmortel.

    [Sidenote: The great hopes, and the subtle machinations of the
    wicked, are often suddenly frustrated, by which an end is put to
    their wickedness.]

  Of whiche shrewes þe grete hope {and} þe heye co{m}passy{n}g{us}
  of shrewednesse is often destroyed by a                           3552
  sodeyne ende or þei ben war. {and} þat þing establiþ to
  shrewes þe ende of hir shrewednesse.

    [Sidenote: If vice renders men wretched, the longer they are
    vicious the longer must they be miserable.]

          ¶ For yif þat
  shrewednesse makiþe wrecches. þan mot he nedes be
  most wrecched þat lengest is a shrewe.

    [Sidenote: And they would be infinitely wretched if death did not
    put an end to their crimes.]

          þe whiche                                                 3556
  wicked shrewes wolde ydemen aldirmost vnsely {and}
  caytifs yif þat hir shrewednes ne were yfinissed. at þe     [[pg 125]]
  leste weye by þe outerest[e] deeþ.

    [Sidenote: It is clear, as I have already shown, that eternal
    misery is infinite.]

          for [yif] I haue concluded
  soþe of þe vnselynesse of shrewednesse. þan sheweþ                3560
  it clerely þat þilke shrewednesse is wiþ outen ende þe
  whiche is certeyne to ben p{er}durable.

    [Sidenote: _B._ This consequence appears to be just, but difficult
    to assent to.]

          ¶ Certys q{uo}d I
  þis [conclusion] is harde {and} wonderful to graunte. ¶ But
  I knowe wel þat it accordeþ moche to [the] þi{n}ges þat I         3564
  haue graunted her byforne.

    [Sidenote: _P._ You think rightly; but if you cannot assent to my
    conclusion you ought to show that the premises are false, or that
    the consequences are unfairly deduced; for if the premises be
    granted, you cannot reject the inferences from them.]

          ¶ þou hast q{uo}d she þe ryȝt
  estimac{i}ou{n} of þis. but who so euere wene þat it be an
  harde þing to acorde hym to a conclusiou{n}. it is ryȝt

  who so seiþ it folweþ of þat whiche þat is p{ur}posed
  byforn.

    [Sidenote: _B._ What is that?]

          what is þat q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ That the wicked who have been punished for their
    crimes, are happier than if justice had allowed them to go
    unpunished.]

          ¶ certys q{uo}d she þat is                                3576
  þat þ{a}t þise wicked shrewes ben more blysful or ellys
  lasse wrecches. þat byen þe tourmentes þat þei han
  deserued. þan yif no peyne of Iustice ne chastied[e]
  hem.

    [Sidenote: I do not appeal to popular arguments, that punishment
    corrects vice, that the fear of chastisement leads them to take
    the right path, and that the sufferings of evil-doers deter others
    from vice, but I believe that guilty men, unpunished, become much
    more unhappy in another way.]

          ne þis ne seye I nat now for þat any man myȝt[e]          3580
  þenk[e] þat þe maneres of shrewes ben coriged {and}
  chastised by veniaunce. {and} þat þei ben brouȝt to þe
  ryȝt wey by þe drede of þe tourment. ne for þat þei
  ȝeuen to oþer folk ensample to fleyen fro{m} vices. ¶ But         3584
  I vndirstonde ȝitte [in] an oþer manere þat shrewes
  ben more vnsely whan þei ne ben nat punissed al be it
  so þat þere ne ben had no resou{n} or lawe of correcc{i}ou{n}.
  ne none ensample of lokynge.

    [Sidenote: _B._ In what way do you mean?]

          ¶ And what manere                                         3588
  shal þat ben q{uo}d I. ouþer þan haþ ben told here          [[pg 126]]
  byforn

    [Sidenote: _P._ Are not good people happy, and evil folk
    miserable?]

          ¶ Haue we nat graunted þan q{uo}d she þat
  good[e] folk ben blysful. {and} shrewes ben wrecches.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Yes.]

  ȝis q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ If good be added to the wretchedness of a man,
    will not he be happier than another whose misery has no element of
    good in it?]

          [thanne q{uod} she] ȝif þat any good were                 3592
  added to þe wrecchenesse of any wyȝt. nis he nat more
  blisful þan he þat ne haþ no medelyng of goode in hys
  solitarie wrecchednesse.

    [Sidenote: _B._ It seems so.]

          so semeþ it q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ And if to the same wretched being another misery
    be annexed, does not he become more wretched than he whose misery
    is alleviated by the participation of some good?]

          and what
  seyst þou þan q{uo}d she of þilke wrecche þat lakkeþ alle         3596
  goodes. so þat no goode nis medeled in hys wrecchednesse.
  {and} ȝitte ouer alle hys wickednesse for whiche
  he is a wrecche þat þer be ȝitte anoþer yuel anexid {and}
  knyt to hym. shal not men demen hym more vnsely                   3600
  þan þilke wrecche of whiche þe vnselynesse is re[le]ued
  by þe p{ar}ticipac{i}ou{n} of som goode.

    [Sidenote: _B._ He does.]

          whi sholde he nat
  q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ When evil men are punished they have a degree of
    good annexed to their wretchedness, to wit, the punishment itself,
    which as it is the effect of justice is good.]

          ¶ þan certys q{uo}d she han shrewes whan þei
  ben punissed somwhat of good anexid to hir wrecchednesse.         3604
  þat is to seyne þe same peyne þat þei suffren
  whiche þat is good by þe resou{n} of Iustice.

    [Sidenote: And when these wretches escape punishment something
    more of ill (_i. e._ exemption from punishment) is added to their
    condition.]

          And whan
  þilke same shrewes ascapen wiþ outen tourment. þan
  han þei somwhat more of yuel ȝit ouer þe wickednesse              3608
  þat þei han don. þat is to seye defaute of peyne.
  whiche defaute of peyne þou hast graunted is yuel.

    [Sidenote: _B._ I cannot deny it.]

  ¶ For þe desert of felonye I ne may nat denye it q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Much more unhappy are the wicked when they enjoy
    an unmerited impunity than when they suffer a lawful
    chastisement.]

  ¶ Moche more þan q{uo}d she ben shrewes vnsely                    3612
  whan þei ben wrongfully delyuered fro peyne. þan
  whan þei beþ punissed by ryȝtful vengeaunce.

    [Sidenote: It is just to punish evil-doers, and unjust that they
    should escape punishment.]

          but þis is
  open þi{n}g {and} clere þat it is ryȝt þat shrewes ben
  punissed. {and} it is wickednesse {and} wrong þat þei             3616
  escapin vnpunissed.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Nobody denies that.]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 28 _b_.]]

          ¶ who myȝt[e] denye *þat q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Everything, too, which is just is good; and, on
    the contrary, whatsoever is unjust is evil.]

  but q{uo}d she may any ma{n} denye. þat al þat is ryȝt nis
  good. {and} also þe contrarie. þat alle þat is wrong nis
  wicked.                                                     [[pg 127]]

    [Sidenote: _B._ These are just inferences from our former
    premises.]

          certys q{uo}d I þise þinges ben clere ynouȝ. {and}        3620
  þat we han concludid a litel here byforn{e}.

    [Sidenote: But is there any punishment for the soul after death of
    the body?]

          but I p{re}ye
  þe þat þou telle me yif þou accordest to leten no to{ur}ment
  to þe soules aftir þat þe body is dedid by þe deþe.
  þis [is] to seyn. vndirstondest þou ouȝt þat soules han           3624
  any to{ur}ment after þe deþe of þe body.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Yes, and great ones too. Some punishments are
    rigorous and eternal.]

          ¶ Certis q{uo}d
  she ȝe {and} þat ryȝt grete. of whiche soules q{uo}d she I
  trowe þat so{m}me ben to{ur}mentid by asprenesse of
  peyne.

    [Sidenote: Others have a corrective and purifying force, and are
    of finite duration.]

          {and} so{m}me soules I trowe be exc{er}cised by a         3628
  p{ur}ging mekenesse.

    [Sidenote: But this is not to our purpose.]

          but my conseil nys nat to determyne
  of þis peyne. but I haue trauayled and told it
  hider to.

    [Sidenote: I want you to see that the power of the wicked is in
    reality nothing, that the wicked never go unpunished; that their
    licence to do evil is not of long duration, and that the wicked
    would be more unhappy if it were longer, and infinitely wretched
    if it were to continue for ever.]

          ¶ For þou sholdest knowe þat þe mowynge
  [.i. myght] of shrewes whiche mowynge þe semeþ to                 3632
  ben. vnworþi nis no mowynge. {and} eke of shrewes of
  whiche þou pleynedest þat þei ne were nat punissed.
  þat þou woldest seen þat þei ne weren neuer mo wiþ
  outen þe torment of hire wickednesse. {and} of þe licence         3636
  of mowynge to done yuel. þat þou p{re}idest þat it
  myȝt[e] sone ben endid. {and} þat þou woldest fayne
  lerne. þat it ne sholde nat longe endure. {and} þat
  shrewes ben more vnsely yif þei were of lenger duryng.            3640
  {and} most vnsely yif þei weren p{er}durable.

    [Sidenote: After this I showed that evil men are more unhappy,
    having escaped punishment, than if justly chastised.]

          {and} after
  þis I haue shewed þe þat more vnsely ben shrewes
  whan þei escapen wiþ oute ryȝtful peyne. þan whan þei
  ben punissed by ryȝtful uengeaunce.

    [Sidenote: Wherefore when they are supposed to get off scot-free
    they suffer most grievously.]

          and of þis sentence                                       3644
  folweþ it þat þan be{n} shrewes constreyned atte laste wiþ
  most greuous tourment. whan men wene þat þei ne ben
  nat ypunissed.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Your reasoning appears convincing and conclusive.
    But your arguments are opposed to current opinions, and would
    hardly command assent, or even a hearing.]

          whan I considre þi resou{n}s q{uo}d I. I.
  ne trowe nat þat men seyn any þing more verrely. {and}            3648
  yif I to{ur}ne aȝeyn to þe studies of men. who is [he] to
  who{m} it sholde seme þat [he] ne sholde nat only leue{n}
  þise þinges. but eke gladly herkene he{m}.

    [Sidenote: _P._ It is so. For those accustomed to the darkness of
    error cannot fix their eyes on the light of perspicuous truth,
    like birds of night which are blinded by the full light of day.]

          Certys q{uo}d
  she so it is. but men may nat. for þei han hire eyen so     [[pg 128]]
  wont to derkenesse of erþely þinges. þat þei may nat              3653

  þei ben lyke to briddes of whiche þe nyȝt lyȝtneþ hyre
  lookyng. {and} þe day blyndeþ hem.

    [Sidenote: They consider only the gratification of their lusts,
    they think there is happiness in the liberty of doing evil and in
    exemption from punishment.]

          for whan men loken                                        3656

    [Sidenote: Vice is a sickness of the soul, and needs our

    more deplorable than those of the body, and have more claims upon

    OF FATE AND PROVIDENCE.]

    [Sidenote: Reflection on the efficacy of the one and the other
    will soon cause us to see their differences.]

    [Sidenote: Providence is the divine intelligence manifested in the
    disposition of worldly affairs.]

          ¶ For p{ur}ueau{n}ce                                      3868

  p{r}ince of þinges. þe whiche p{ur}ueaunce disponiþ alle
  þinges.

    [Sidenote: Destiny or Fate is that inherent state or condition of
    movable things by means whereof Providence retains them in the
    order in which she has placed them.]

          but destine is þe disposic{i}ou{n} {and} ordenaunce

  þe p{ur}ueaunce knyteþ alle þinges in hire ordres.

    [Sidenote: Providence embraces all things, although diverse and
    infinite; but Fate gives motion to every individual thing, and in
    the place and under the form appropriated to it.]

  ¶ For p{ur}ueaunce enbraceþ alle þi{n}ges to hepe. al þouȝ þat
  þei ben dyuerse {and} al þouȝ þei ben wiþ outen fyn. but

  {and} diuideþ. in moeuynges. in places. in formes. in
  tymes. dep{ar}tiþ [as] þus.

    [Sidenote: So that the explication of this order of things wrapt
    up in the divine intelligence is Providence; and being unfolded
    according to time and other circumstances, may be called Fate.]

          so þat þe vnfoldyng of temp{or}el

  tymes. lat þat ben called destine.

    [Sidenote: Though these things appear to differ, yet one of them
    depends on the other, for the order of Fate proceeds from the
    unity of Providence.]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 30 _b_.]]

    [Sidenote: For as a workman, who has formed in his head the plan
    of a work which he is desirous to finish, executes it afterwards,
    and produces after a time all the different parts of the model
    which he has conceived;]

          for ryȝt as a werkma{n} þat

    everything to be brought about in a certain order and in a proper
    time;]

          ¶ Certys ryȝt so god disponiþ

    [Sidenote: and afterwards, by the ministry of Fate, he
    accomplishes what he has planned, conformably to that order and
    that time.]

  destine.

    [Sidenote: So then, however Fate be exercised, it is evident that
    things subject to Destiny are under the control of Providence,
    which disposes Destiny.]

          For whiche it is þat alle þinges þat ben put
  vndir destine ben certys subgitȝ to p{ur}ueaunce. to
  whiche p{ur}ueaunce destine it self is subgit {and} vndir.

    [Sidenote: But some things under Providence are exempt from the
    control of Fate; being stably fixed near to the Divinity himself,
    and beyond the movement of Destiny.]

  ¶ But so{m}me þinges ben put vndir purueaunce þat                 3908

  so{ur}mou{n}ten þe ordre of destinal moeuablite.

    [Sidenote: For even, as among several circles revolving round one
    common centre, that which is innermost approaches nearest to the
    simplicity of the middle points, and is, as it were, a centre,
    round which the outward ones revolve;]

          ¶ For
  ryȝt as cercles þat to{ur}nen aboute a same Centre or             3912

  ioineþ to þe symplesse of þe myddel {and} is as it
  were a Centre or a poynt to þat oþer cercles þat tourne{n}
  aboute{n} hym.

    [Sidenote: whilst the outermost, revolving in a wider
    circumference, the further it is from the centre describes a
    larger space--but yet, if this circle or anything else be joined
    to the middle point, it is constrained to be immovable.]

          ¶ and þilke þat is outerest compased by                   3916

  {and} it ceseth to ben shad {and} to fleti{n} dyuersly.

    [Sidenote: By parity of reason, the further anything is removed
    from the first intelligence, so much the more is it under the
    control of Destiny;]

          ¶ Ryȝt
  so by semblable resou{n}. þilke þinge þat dep{ar}tiþ firþest
  fro þe first þouȝt of god. it is vnfolde{n} {and} su{m}mittid     3924
  to grettere bondes of destine.

    [Sidenote: and the nearer anything approaches to this
    Intelligence, the centre of all things, the more stable it
    becomes, and the less dependent upon Destiny.]

          and in so moche is þe
  þing more free {and} lovs fro destyne as it axeþ {and}

    DESTINY RULES NATURE.]

    [Sidenote: And if we suppose that the thing in question is joined
    to the stability of the supreme mind, it then becomes immovable,
    and is beyond the necessity and power of destiny.]

          ¶ and if þe þinge cleueþ to þe stedfastnesse              3928

    [Sidenote: As reasoning is to the understanding, as that which is
    produced to that which exists of itself, as time to eternity, as
    the circle to the centre, so is the movable order of Fate to the
    stable simplicity of Providence.]

    [Sidenote: It controls the actions of men by an indissoluble chain
    of causes, and is, like their origin, immutable.]

          and þis ilke ordre co{n}streyneþ

    [Sidenote: Thus, then, are all things well conducted, since that
    invariable order of cause has its origin in the simplicity of the
    Divine mind, and by its inherent immutability exercises a
    restraint upon mutable things, and preserves them from
    irregularity.]

    by crooked error.]

  whan god þat alle knoweþ doþ swiche þing. of whiche               3996
  þing [þat] vnknowyng folk ben astoned

    [Sidenote: But, now let us notice a few things concerning the
    depth of the Divine knowledge which human reason may comprehend.]

          but forto constreine
  as who seiþ ¶ But forto co{m}prehende {and} telle
  a fewe þinges of þe deuyne depnesse þe whiche þat mans
  resou{n} may vnderstonde.

    [Sidenote: The man you deem just, may appear otherwise to the
    omniscient eye of Providence.]

          ¶ þilk man þat þou wenest                                 4000

  ¶ And lucan my familier telleþ þat þe victories cause
  liked[e] to þe goddes {and} causes ouercomen liked[e] to          4004
  cato{u}n.

    [Sidenote: When you see apparent irregularities--unexpected and
    unwished for--deem them to be rightly done.]

          þan what so euer þou mayst seen þat is don in
  þis [world] vnhoped or vnwened. certys it is þe ryȝt[e]
  ordre of þinges. but as to þi wicked[e] oppiniou{n} it is a
  co{n}fusiou{n}.

    [Sidenote: Let us suppose a man so well behaved, as to be approved
    of God and man--but not endowed with firmness of mind, so that the
    reverses of fortune will cause him to forgo his probity, since
    with it he cannot retain his prosperity.]

          but I suppose þat som man be so wel yþewed.               4008
  þat þe deuyne Iugement {and} þe Iugeme{n}t of mankynde
  accorden hem to gidre of hym. but he is so vnstedfast
  of corage [þat] yif any aduersite come to hym he wolde
  for-leten p{er}auenture to continue i{n}nocence by þe             4012
  whiche he ne may nat wiþholden fortune.

    [Sidenote: A wise Providence, knowing that adversity might destroy
    this man’s integrity, averts from him that adversity which he is
    not able to sustain.]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 31 _b_.]]

          ¶ þan þe
  wise dispensac{i}ou{n} of god spareþ hym þe whiche
  man{er}e adu{er}site *myȝt[e] enpeyren. ¶ For þat god
  wil nat suffren hym to trauaile. to whom þat trauayl              4016
  nis nat couenable.

    [Sidenote: Another man is thoroughly virtuous, and approaches to
    the purity of the deity--him Providence deems it an injustice to
    oppress by adversity, and therefore exempts him even from bodily
    disease.]

          ¶ An oþ{er} man is p{er}fit in alle
  uertues. {and} is an holy man {and} neye to god so þat þe
  p{ur}ueaunce of god wolde demen þat it were a felony
  þat he were touched wiþ any aduersites. so þat he ne              4020
  wil nat suffre þat swiche a man be moeued wiþ any           [[pg 140]]
  manere maladie. ¶ But so as seide a philosophre [the
  moore excellent by me]. þe adu{er}sites comen nat (he
  seide in grec[;]) þere þ{a}t uertues han edified þe bodie         4024
  of þe holy man.

    [Sidenote: Providence often gives the direction of public affairs
    to good men, in order to curb and restrain the malice of the
    wicked.]

          and ofte tyme it bitideþ þat þe
  so{m}me of þinges þat ben to don is taken to good folk
  to gouerne. for þat þe malice habundaunt of shrewes
  sholde ben abatid.

    [Sidenote: To some is given a mixture of good and evil, according
    to what is most suitable to the dispositions of their minds.]

          {and} god ȝeueþ {and} dep{ar}tiþ to oþer                  4028
  folk p{ro}sp[er]ites {and} aduersites ymedeled to hepe aftir
  þe qualite of hire corages {and} remordiþ som folk by
  adu{er}sites.

    [Sidenote: Upon some are laid moderate afflictions, lest they wax
    proud by too long a course of prosperity.]

          for þei ne sholden nat wexen proude by
  longe welefulnesse.

    [Sidenote: Others suffer great adversities that their virtues may
    be exercised, and strengthened by the practice of patience.]

          {and} oþer folk he suffreþ to ben                         4032
  trauayled wiþ harde þinges. ¶ For þat þei sholden conferme
  þe vertues of corage by þe vsage {and} ex{er}citac{i}ou{n}
  of pacie{n}ce.

    [Sidenote: Some fear to be afflicted with what they are able to
    endure. Others despise what they are unable to bear; and God
    punishes them with calamities, to make them sensible of their
    presumption.]

          and oþer folke dreden more þen þei auȝten
  þe wiche þei myȝt[en] wel beren. {and} þilke folk god             4036
  lediþ in to exp{er}ience of hem self by aspre {and} sorweful
  þinges.

    [Sidenote: Many have purchased a great name by a glorious death.]

          ¶ And many oþer folk han bouȝt honorable
  renoune of þis worlde by þe pris of glorious deeþ.

    [Sidenote: Others by their unshaken fortitude, have shown that
    virtue cannot be overcome by adversity.]

  and som men þat ne mowen nat ben ouer-comen by                    4040
  tourment han ȝeuen ensample to oþer folk þat vertue ne
  may nat be ouer-comen by aduersites.

   [[Transcriber’s Note:
   The sidenote “Others despise what they are unable to bear” does not
   correspond to anything in the text. Skeat’s edition includes the
   phrase “and somme dispyse that they mowe nat beren” (Book IV,
   Prose 6: _Ita Est Inquam_).]]

    adversity and sometimes prosperity falls to the lot of the
    wicked.]

          ¶ For certys þat aduersite

    [Sidenote: When the wicked enjoy felicity--the good should learn
    how little these external advantages are to be prized, which may
    fall to the lot of the most worthless.]

          ¶ And þe p{ro}sp{er}ite þat is ȝeuen to

    wicked.]

  ++Sest þou nat þan what þing folweþ alle þe þinges þat I

    [Sidenote: _B._ What is it?]

          and how may þat be

    [Sidenote: _P._ Since all fortune, whether prosperous or adverse,
    is for the reward of the good or the punishment of the bad, all
    fortune is good which is either just or useful.]

  ¶ For þerfore is it called uertue. for þat it susteniþ {and}      4220

    remember that even adverse fortune, unless it exercises the
    virtues of the good or chastises the wicked, is a punishment.]

    THE EXISTENCE OF CHANCE.]

INCIPIT LIBER QUINTUS.


DIXERAT ORACIONISQ{UE} CURSUM.

  [Sidenote: [The fyrste prose.]]

    [Sidenote: When Philosophy had thus spoken, and was about to
    discuss other matters I interrupted her.]

  ++She hadde seid {and} to{ur}ned[e] þe cours of hir resou{n} to
  so{m}me oþ{er} þinges to ben tretid {and} to ben ysped.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Thy exhortation is just and worthy of thy
    authority, but thou saidst that the question of the Divine
    Superintendence or Providence is involved with many others--and
    this I believe.]

  þan seide I. Certys ryȝtful is þin amonestyng {and} ful           4296
  digne by auctorite. but þat þou seidest som tyme þat
  þe questiou{n} of þe deuyne p{ur}ueaunce is enlaced wiþ
  many oþer questiou{n}s. I vndir-stonde wel {and} p{ro}ue it
  by þe same þinge.

    [Sidenote: I am desirous, however, of knowing whether there be
    such a thing as _Chance_, and what thou thinkest it is.]

          but I axe yif þat þou wenest þat hap                      4300
  be any þing in any weys. {and} if þou wenest þat hap be
  any [thing] what is it.

    [Sidenote: _P._ I hasten to fulfil my promise and to show the road
    to your own country.]

          þan q{uo}d she. I haste me to
  ȝelden {and} assoilen þe to þe dette of my byheste {and}
  to shewen {and} opnen þe wey by whiche wey þou maist              4304
  come aȝein to þi contre.

    [Sidenote: But although these things you question me about are
    profitable to know, yet they lead us a little out of our way.]

          ¶ but al be it so þat þe þinges
  whiche þat þou axest b{e}n ryȝt p{ro}fitable to knowe.
  ȝitte ben þei diuers somwhat fro þe paþe of my purpos.

    [Sidenote: And by straying from the path you may be too fatigued
    to return to the right road.]

  And it is to douten þat þou ne be maked weery by                  4308
  mysweys so þat þou ne mayst nat suffise to mesure{n} þe
  ryȝt weye.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Don’t be afraid of that, for it will refresh me as
    much as rest to know these things in which I am delightfully
    interested.]

          ¶ Ne doute þe þer-of no þing q{uo}d I. for
  forto knowen þilke þinges to-gidre in þe whiche þinges
  I delite me gretly. þat shal ben to me in stede of reste.         4312
  Syn it nis nat to douten of þe þinges folwy{n}ge whan
  euery side of þi disputisou{n} shal be stedfast to me by
  vndoutous feiþ. þan seide she. þat manere wol I don
  þe. {and} byga{n} to speken ryȝt þus                        [[pg 150]]

    [Sidenote: _P._ I will then comply with thy requests.]

          ¶ Certys q{uo}d she                                       4316

    [Headnote:
    DEFINITION OF CHANCE.]

    [Sidenote: If we define Chance to be an event produced by an
    unintelligent motion, and not by a chain or connection of causes,
    I should then affirm that Chance is nothing and an empty sound.]

  þat hap is bytidynge y-brouȝt forþe by foelyshe
  moeuynge. {and} by no knyttyng of causes. ¶ I conferme
  þat hap nis ryȝt nauȝt in no wise. and I deme al                  4320
  outerly þat hap nis ne dwelliþ but a voys. ¶ As who
  seiþ. but an ydel worde wiþ outen any significac{i}ou{n} of
  þing summittid to þat vois.

    [Sidenote: What room is there for folly and disorder where all
    things are restrained by order, through the ordinance of God?]

          for what place myȝt[e] ben
  left or dwellynge to folie {and} to disordinau{n}ce. syn þat      4324
  god lediþ {and} streyniþ alle þinges by ordre.

    [Sidenote: For it is a great truth that nothing can spring out of
    nothing.]

          ¶ For þis
  sentence is verray {and} soþe þat no þinge ne haþ his
  beynge of nouȝt. to [the] whiche sentence none of þise
  olde folk ne wiþseide neuere al be it so þat þei ne               4328
  vndirstoden ne moeueden it nauȝt by god p{r}ince {and}
  gynner of wirkyng. but þei casten as a manere foundement
  of subgit material. þat is to seyn of [the] nature
  of alle resou{n}.

    [Sidenote: Now, if anything arises without the operation of a
    cause, it proceeds from nothing.]

          {and} ȝif þat ony þinge is woxen or comen                 4332
  of no causes. þan shal it seme þat þilke þinge is comen
  or woxen of nouȝt.

    [Sidenote: But if this is impossible, then there can be no such a
    thing as Chance, as we have defined it.]

          but yif þis ne may nat ben don.
  þan is it nat possible þat þere haþ ben any swiche þing
  as I haue diffinissid a litel here byforne.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Is there nothing, then, that may be called Chance
    or Fortune?]

          ¶ How shal                                                4336
  it þan ben q{uo}d I. nis þer þan no þing þat by ryȝt may
  be cleped eyþer hap{pe} or ellis auenture of fortune.

    [Sidenote: Is there nothing (hid from the vulgar) to which these
    words may be applied?]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 34.]]

          or is
  þer ouȝt al *be it so þat it is hidd fro þe poeple to
  whiche þise wordes ben couenable.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Aristotle defines this matter with much precision
    and probability.]

          Myn aristotul q{uo}d                                      4340
  she. in þe book of his phisik diffinisseþ þis þing by
  short resou{n} and neyȝe to þe soþe.

    [Sidenote: _B._ How?]

          ¶ In whiche manere
  q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ So often as a man does anything for the sake of
    any other thing, and another thing than what he intended to do is
    produced by other causes, that thing so produced is called
    _Chance_.]

          ¶ As ofte q{uo}d she as men don any þing for
  grace of any oþer þing. {and} an oþer þinge þan þilke             4344
  þing þat men ententen to doon bytideþ by som[e] causes
  it is ycleped hap{pe}.

    [Sidenote: As if a man trench the ground for tillage and find
    gold, then this is believed to happen by chance, although it is
    not so.]

          ¶ Ryȝt as a man dalf þe erþe by
  cause of tylienge of þe felde. {and} fond þere a gobet of   [[pg 151]]
  golde by-doluen. þan wenen folk þat it is fallen by fortunous     4348
  bytydyng. but for soþe it nis nat for nauȝt for
  it haþ hys p{ro}pre causes of whiche causes þe cours vnforseyn
  and vnwar semiþ to han maked hap{pe}.

    [Sidenote: For if the tiller had not ploughed the field, and if
    the hider of the gold had not concealed it in that spot, the gold
    had not been found.]

          ¶ For
  yif þe tilier in þe erþe ne delue nat in þe felde. and yif        4352
  þe hider of þe golde ne hadde hidd þe golde in þilke
  place. þe golde ne had[de] nat ben founde.

    [Sidenote: These, then, are the causes of a fortuitous acquisition
    which proceeds from a conflux of encountering causes, and not from
    the intention of the doer.]

          þise ben
  þan þe causes of þe abreggynge of fortune hap. þe whiche
  abreggynge of fortune hap comeþ of causes encountrynge            4356
  {and} flowyng to-gidre to hem selfe. {and} nat by þe entenc{i}ou{n}
  of þe doer.

    [Sidenote: For neither the hider of the gold nor the husbandman
    intended or understood that the gold should be found.]

          ¶ For neiþer þe hider of þe gold.
  ne þe deluer of þe felde ne vndirstanden nat þat þe
  golde sholde han be founde. but as I seide.

    [Sidenote: But it happened by the concurrence of these two causes
    that the one did dig where the other had hidden the money.]

          it bytidde                                                4360
  {and} ran to-gidre þat he dalf þere as þat oþer hadde hidd
  þe golde.

    [Sidenote: Chance, then, is an unexpected event, by a concurrence
    of causes, following an action designed for a particular purpose.]

          Now may I þus diffinissen hap{pe}. ¶ Hap{pe}
  is an vnwar bytydyng of causes assembled in þinges þat
  ben don for som oþer þinge. but þilke ordre p{ro}cedynge          4364
  by an vneschewable byndynge to-gidre.

    [Sidenote: This concurrence of causes proceeds from that order
    which flows from the fountain of Providence and disposes all
    things as to place and time.]

          whiche þat
  descendeþ fro þe wel of purueaunce þat ordeineþ alle
  þinges i{n} hir{e} places {and} in hire tymes makeþ þat þe
  causes rennen {and} assemblen to-gidre.                           4368

RUPIS ACHEMENIE.

  [Sidenote: [The fyrste Met{ur}.]]

    [Sidenote: Where the flying Parthian doth pierce his pursuers with
    his shafts, there from the Achemenian heights flow the Tigris and
    Euphrates, but soon their streams divide and flow into separate
    channels.]

A{N}I{M}ADUERTO INQ{UA}M.

  [Sidenote: [The .2^de. p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: _B._ Is there any _free-will_ in this chain of cohering
    causes?]

  ++Þis vndirstonde I wel q{uo}d I. {and} accorde wel þat it

    [Sidenote: Or doth the _chain of destiny_ constrain the motions of
    the human mind?]

          ¶ or ellys I wolde witen yif þat þe
  destinal cheine co{n}streiniþ þe moeueuynge of þe corages
  of me{n}.

    [Sidenote: _P._ There is a freedom of the will possessed by every
    rational being.]

          yis q{uo}d she þer is liberte of fre wille. ne þer        4392
  ne was neuer no nature of resou{n} þat it ne hadde liberte
  of fre wille.

    [Sidenote: A rational being has judgment to judge of and discern
    everything.]

          ¶ For euery þing þat may naturely vsen
  resou{n}. it haþ doom by whiche it discerniþ {and} demiþ
  euery þing.

    [Sidenote: Of himself he knows what he is to avoid or to desire.
    He seeks what he judges desirable, and he shuns what he deems
    should be avoided.]

          ¶ þan knoweþ it by it self þinges þat be{n}               4396

    PROVIDENCE SEES ALL THINGS.]

    [Sidenote: A rational being possesses, then, the liberty of
    choosing and rejecting.]

  ¶ wher-fore in alle þinges þ{a}t resou{n} is. i{n} hem also is    4400
  libertee of willyng {and} of nillynge.

    [Sidenote: This liberty is not equal in all beings.]

          ¶ But I ne ordeyne
  nat. as who seiþ. I ne graunte nat þat þis lib{er}tee be
  euene like in alle þinges.

    [Sidenote: In heavenly substances, as spirits, &c., judgment is
    clear, and the will is incorruptible, and has a ready and
    efficacious power of doing things which are desired.]

          forwhi in þe souereyns deuynes
  substau{n}ces.

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 34 _b_.]]

          þat is to *seyn in spiritȝ ¶ Iugement is                  4404
  more clere {and} wil nat be corumped. {and} haþ myȝt        [[pg 153]]
  redy to speden þinges þat ben desired.

    [Sidenote: The souls of men must needs be more free when employed
    in the contemplation of the Divine Mind, and less so when they
    enter into a body, and still less free when enclosed and confined
    in earthly members; but the most extreme servitude is when they
    are given over to vice and wholly fallen from their proper
    reason.]

          ¶ But þe soules
  of men moten nedes ben more free whan þei loken hem
  in þe speculac{i}ou{n} or lokynge of þe deuyne þouȝt. {and}       4408

  free whan þei ben gadred to-gidre {and} co{m}p{re}hendid in

  ben ȝeue{n} to vices. {and} han yfalle fro þe possessiou{n} of    4412
  hire p{ro}pre resou{n}

    [Sidenote: For at once they are enveloped by the cloud of
    ignorance and are troubled by pernicious desires, by yielding to
    which they aid and increase that slavery which they brought upon
    themselves, and thus even under the liberty proper to them, they
    remain captives.]

          ¶ For after þat þei han cast aweye
  hir eyen fro þe lyȝt of þe souereyn soþefastnesse to lowe
  þinges {and} dirke ¶ Anon þei dirken by þe cloude of

    [Sidenote: Yet the eye of Providence, beholding all things from
    eternity, sees all this and disposes according to their merit all
    things as they are predestinated.]

    Yet the sun’s beams cannot pierce into the inner bowels of the
    earth, nor into the depths of the sea.]

    his vision impeded neither by earth nor cloud.]

    GOD’S FOREKNOWLEDGE AND MAN’S FREE WILL.]

TAMEN EGO EN INQ{UA}M.

  [Sidenote: [The .3^de. p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: _B._ I am distracted by a more difficult doubt than
    ever.]

  ++ÞAn seide I now am I co{n}fou{n}ded by a more harde
  doute þan I was. what doute is þat q{uo}d she.
  ¶ For certys I coniecte now by whiche þinges þou art
  troubled.

    [Sidenote: God’s foreknowledge seems to me inconsistent with man’s
    free-will.]

          It semeþ q{uo}d I to repugnen {and} to contrarien         4440
  gretly þat god knoweþ byforn alle þinges. {and}
  þat þer is any fredom of liberte.

    [Sidenote: For if God foresees all things, and cannot be deceived,
    then that which Providence hath foreseen must needs happen.]

          for yif so be þat god
  lokeþ alle þinges byforn. ne god ne may nat ben
  desseiuid in no manere. þan mot it nedes ben þat alle             4444
  þinges bytyden þe whiche þat þe purueaunce of god haþ
  sein byforn to comen.

    [Sidenote: If God from eternity doth foreknow not only the works,
    but the designs and wills of men, there can be no liberty of
    will--nor can there be any other action or will than that which a
    Divine and infallible Providence hath foreseen.]

          ¶ For whiche yif þat god
  knoweþ by-forn nat oonly þe werkes of men. but also
  hir conseils {and} hir willes. þan ne shal þer be no              4448
  liberte of arbitre. ne certys þer ne may ben noon oþer
  dede ne no wille but þilke whiche þe deuyne purueaunce
  þat ne may nat ben desseiued haþ feled byforn

    [Sidenote: For if things fall out contrary to such foreseeing, and
    are wrested another way, the prescience of God in regard to
    futurity would not be sure and unerring--it would be nothing but
    an uncertain opinion of them: but I take it to be impious and
    unlawful to believe this of God.]

          ¶ For
  yif þat þei myȝten wryþen awey in oþer manere þan þei             4452
  ben purueyed. þan ne sholde þer ben no stedfast p{re}science
  of þinge to comen but raþer an vncerteyn
  oppiniou{n}. þe whiche þinge to trowen on god I deme it
  felonie {and} vnleueful.

    [Sidenote: Nor do I approve of the reasoning made use of by some.
    For they say that a thing is not necessarily to happen because God
    hath foreseen it, but rather because it is to happen it cannot be
    hid from the divine Providence.]

          ¶ Ne I ne proeue nat þilk                                 4456
  same resou{n}. as who seiþ I ne allowe nat. or I ne p{re}ise
  nat þilke same resou{n} by whiche þat som men wenen
  þat þei mowen assoilen {and} vnknytten þe knot of þis
  questiou{n}. ¶ For certys þei seyn þ{a}t þing nis nat to          4460
  come for þat þe purueaunce of god haþ seyn it byforn{e}.
  þat is to comen but raþer þe cont{ra}rie. ¶ And þat
  is þis þat for þat þe þing is to comen þat þerfore
  ne may it nat ben hyd fro þe purueaunce of god.                   4464

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 35.]]

    [Sidenote: Now by this reason necessity appears to change sides.
    For it is not necessary that the things which are foreseen should
    happen, but it is necessary that the things which are to befall
    should be foreseen.]

  *{and} in þis manere þis necessite slydiþ aȝein in to þe    [[pg 155]]
  contrarie p{ar}tie. ne it ne byhoueþ [nat] nedes þat þinges
  bytiden þat ben ypurueid. [but it by-houeth nedes /
  þ{a}t thinges þ{a}t ben to comyn ben yporueyid] but as it         4468
  were yt{ra}uailed.

    [Sidenote: As if the question was, which was the cause of the
    other--_prescience_ the cause of the necessity of future events,
    or the _necessity_ the cause of the prescience of future events?]

          as who seiþ. þat þilke answere p{ro}cediþ
  ryȝt as þouȝ men trauailden or weren bysy to
  enqueren þe whiche þing is cause of whiche þinges. as
  wheþer þe p{re}science is cause of þe necessite of þinges to      4472
  comen. or ellys þat þe necessite of þi{n}ges to comen is
  cause of þe purueau{n}ce.

    [Sidenote: But I will prove that, however the order of causes may
    stand, the event of things foreseen is necessary, although
    prescience doth not seem to impose a necessity upon future things
    to fall out.]

          ¶ But I ne enforce me nat now
  to shewe{n} it þat þe bytidyng of þinges y-wist byforn is
  necessarie. how so or in what manere þat þe ordre of              4476
  causes haþ it self. al þouȝ þat it ne seme nat þat þe
  p{re}science brynge in necessite of bytydynge of þinges
  to comen.

    [Sidenote: For if a man sit--the belief in the sitting is true;
    and, on the other hand, if the opinion is true of his sitting, he
    must needs sit.]

          ¶ For certys yif þat any wyȝt sitteþ it byhoueþ
  by necessite þat þe oppiniou{n} be soþe of hym                    4480
  þ{a}t coniectiþ þat he sitteþ. and aȝeinward. al so is it of
  þe contrarie. yif þe oppiniou{n} be soþe of any wyȝt for
  þat he sitteþ it byhoueþ by necessite þat he sitte

    [Sidenote: In both cases there is a necessity--in the latter that
    the person sits--in the former, that the opinion concerning the
    other is true.]

          ¶ þan
  is here necessite in þat oon {and} in þ{a}t oþer. for in þat      4484
  oon is necessite of sittynge.

    [Sidenote: But the man does not sit because the opinion of his
    sitting is true, but the opinion is true because the action of his
    being seated was antecedent in time.]

          {and} certys in þat oþer is
  necessite of soþe but þerfore ne sitteþ nat a wyȝt for þat
  þe oppiniou{n} of sittyng is soþe. but þe oppiniou{n} is
  raþer soþe for þat a wyȝt sitteþ by-forn.

    [Sidenote: So that although the cause of truth arises from the
    sitting, there is a common necessity in both.]

          and þus al                                                4488
  þouȝ þ{a}t þe cause of soþe comeþ of [þe] syttyng. and
  nat of þe trewe oppiniou{n}. Algates ȝitte is þer comune
  necessite in þat oon {and} in þat oþer.

    [Sidenote: Thus may we reason concerning Providence and future
    events.]

          ¶ þus sheweþ it
  þ{a}t I may make semblable skils of þe p{ur}ueau{n}ce of god      4492
  {and} of þinges to come.

    [Sidenote: For allowing things are foreseen because they are to
    happen, and that they do not befall because they are foreseen, it
    is necessary that future events should be foreseen of God, or if
    foreseen that they should happen; and this alone is sufficient to
    destroy all idea of _free-will_.]

          ¶ For al þouȝ for þat þat þinges
  ben to comen. þer-fore ben þei p{ur}ueid. nat certys for
  þei ben p{ur}ueid. þer-fore ne bytide þei nat. ȝit naþeles
  byhoueþ it by necessite þat eiþer þe þinges to comen              4496
  ben yp{ur}ueied of god. or ellys þat þe þinges þat ben
  p{ur}ueied of god bitiden [.s.] by necessite. ¶ And þis     [[pg 156]]
  þing oonly suffiseþ I-nouȝ to distroien þe fredome of
  oure arbitre. þat is to seyn of oure fre wille

    [Sidenote: But it is preposterous to make the happening of
    temporal things the cause of eternal prescience, which we do in
    imagining that God foresees future events because they are to
    happen.]

          ¶ But now                                                 4500
  [certes] sheweþ it wel how fer fro þe soþe {and} how vp
  so dou{n} is þis þing þat we seyn þat þe bytidinge of
  temp{or}el þinges is þe cause of þe eterne p{re}science.
  ¶ But forto wenen þat god p{ur}ueiþ [the] þinges to comen.        4504
  for þei ben to comen. what oþer þing is it but forto
  wene þat þilke þinges þat bitiden som tyme ben causes
  of þilke souereyne p{ur}ueaunce þat is i{n} god.

    [Sidenote: And, moreover, when I know that anything exists, it is
    necessary for my belief that it should be.]

          ¶ And
  her-to I adde ȝitte þis þing þat ryȝt as whan þat I woot          4508
  þat o þing is it byhoueþ by necessite þat þilke self þing be.

    [Sidenote: So also when I know that an event shall come to pass,
    it must needs happen.]

  {and} eke þat whan I haue knowe þat any þi{n}ge shal
  bitiden so byhoueþ it by necessite þ{a}t þilk[e] same
  þing bytide.

    [Sidenote: The event, therefore, of a thing foreseen must befall.]

          so folweþ it þan þat þe bytydynge of þe                   4512
  þinge Iwist by-forn ne may nat ben eschewed.

    [Sidenote: Lastly, if a person judge a thing to be different to
    what it is--this is not knowledge, but a false opinion of it, and
    far from the true knowledge.]

          ¶ And
  at þe last[e] yif þat any wyȝt wene a þing to ben oþer
  weyes þan it is. it nys nat oonly vnscience. but it is deceiuable

    [Sidenote: If, therefore, a thing be so to happen that the event

    what is to happen?]

          ¶ wher-fore yif any þing be so to comen so þat
  þe bytydynge of it ne be nat certeyne ne necessarie.
  ¶ who may weten [byforn] þ{a}t þilke þing is to come.

    [Sidenote: For as pure knowledge has no element in it of
    falsehood, so what is comprehended by true knowledge cannot be
    otherwise than as comprehended.]

  ¶ For ryȝt as science ne may nat be medelyd wiþ falsnesse.        4520

  be fals þat I ne woot it. ¶ Ryȝt so þilk þing þat
  is conceyued by science ne may [nat] ben noon

    [Sidenote: Hence it is that true knowledge cannot err, because
    everything must precisely be what true knowledge perceives it to
    be.]

          For þat is þe cause                                       4524

    [Sidenote: What follows, then? How does God foreknow these
    uncertain contingencies?]

          what shal I þan sein. ¶ In                                4528

    which possibly may not, he is deceived--but this is sheer
    blasphemy.]

          ¶ For yif þat he deme

    they shall come; if he knows that they may or may not come, what

    [Sidenote: But if there can be no uncertainty in his knowledge,
    who is the source of all certainty; the event of all things which
    he foreknows must be fixed and inevitable.]

    infallible foresight, constrains and binds them to a certain
    event.]

    will be considered most unjust, when, it is allowed, that mankind
    are not prompted by any will of their own, to either virtue or
    vice, but in all their actions are impelled by a fatal necessity.]

          ¶ And it

    the greatest confusion.]

    comes of Divine Providence, and that there is no freedom of the
    human will, that also our vices must be referred to the author of
    all good--which is a most impious opinion.]

  {and} þat is þis þat so as þe ordre of þinges is yledd {and}

    [Sidenote: The cause of this mystery is that the human
    understanding cannot conceive the simplicity of the divine
    prescience, for if it were possible to comprehend this, every
    difficulty would at once disappear.]

  ¶ And þe cause of þis derkenesse {and} [of this] difficulte

  for ne drawest þou nat argumentes from ellys
  where of þe necessite of þinges to comen. As who seiþ             4676
  any oþer wey þan þus. but þat þilke þinge[s] þat þe p{re}scie{n}ce

  seyn þat þei moten bitide.

    [Sidenote: If divine prescience imposes no necessity upon future
    things, must not the issue of things be voluntary, and man’s will
    free and unconstrained?]

          ¶ But þan yif þat p{re}science
  ne putteþ no necessite to þinges to comen. as þou þi self         4680
  hast confessed it {and} byknowen a litel herbyforn{e}.
                  ¶ what                                      [[pg 162]]

  by whiche þat þe endes (exitus) uoluntarie of þinges
  myȝten be constreyned to certeyne bitydyng.

    [Sidenote: For argument sake let us suppose there is no
    prescience, would, then, the events which proceed from free-will
    alone be under the power of necessity?]

          ¶ For                                                     4684
  by grace of possessiou{n}. so þat þou mowe þe better vndirstonde
  þis þat folweþ. ¶ I pose (inpossibile) þat

  necessite.

    [Sidenote: _B._ No.]

          {Boici}us. nay q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ Let us, then, admit Prescience, but that it
    imposes no necessity on what is to happen; the freedom of the will
    would still remain entire and absolute.]

          þan aȝeinward q{uo}d
  she. I suppose þat þere be p{re}science but þat ne putteþ
  no necessite to þinges. þan trowe I þat þilk self fredom          4692
  of wille shal dwelle{n} al hool {and} absolut {and} vnbounden.

    [Sidenote: But although Prescience, you may say, is not the
    necessary cause of future events, yet it is a sign that they shall
    necessarily happen, and hence it follows that, although there were
    no prescience, future events would still be an inevitable
    necessity.]

  but þou wolt sein þat al be it so þat p{re}science
  nis nat cause of þe necessite of bitidynge to þinges to
  comen. ¶ Algates ȝitte it is a signe þ{a}t þe þinges ben          4696

  lest[e] wey. it is certeyne þing þat þe e{n}dys {and} þe
  bitydynges of þinges to come{n} sholde ben necessarie.            4700

    [Sidenote: For the sign of a thing is not really the thing itself,
    but only points out what the individual is.]

  ¶ For euery sygne sheweþ {and} signifieþ oonly what þe
  þing is ¶ but it ne makiþ nat þe þing þat it signifieþ.

    [Sidenote: Wherefore, it must be first proved that everything
    happens by necessity before we can conclude that prescience is a
    sign of that necessity.]

  ¶ For whiche it byhoueþ firste to shewen þat no þing
  ne bitidiþ [þ{a}t it ne bytydith] by necessite. so þat it         4704
  may apere þ{a}t þe p{re}scie{n}ce is signe of þis necessite

    [Sidenote: For if there be no necessity, prescience cannot be the
    sign of that which has no existence.]

    [Sidenote: We see many things when they are done before our eyes;
    such as a charioteer driving his chariot, and other things of like
    nature.]

    to be done?]

  ¶ Is þere þanne any necessite as who seiþ in oure lokynge         4724

    compulsion--the efforts of art would be vain and fruitless.]

  of oure eyen or of oure syȝt.

    [Sidenote: _P._ The things, then, which are done are under no
    necessity that they should be done; then first before they were
    done, they were under no necessity of coming to pass; wherefore
    some things happen, the event of which is unconstrained by
    necessity.]

    [Sidenote: These things therefore, although foreknown, have free
    events: for as the knowledge of present things imposes no
    necessity upon things which are now done, so neither does the
    foreknowledge of futurities necessitate the things which are to
    come.]

          for certys I ne trowe nat þat any man wolde seyn

    [Headnote:
    THE NATURE OF TRUE KNOWLEDGE.]

    [Sidenote: If things are foreknown, you may contend they must
    necessarily happen; and if their event is not necessary, they
    cannot be foreseen, because true knowledge can comprehend nothing
    but what is absolutely certain.]

  ¶ For certys þei seme to discorde. for þou

  ben comp{re}hendid by science but certeyne.

    [Sidenote: And if things uncertain in their events are foreseen as
    certain, this knowledge is nothing more than a false opinion.]

          {and} yif þo
  þinges þat ne han no certeyne bytidynges ben ypurueied
  as certeyn.

    [Sidenote: For it is very remote from true knowledge to judge of
    things otherwise than they really are.]

  a thing to ben oother weys thanne it is it self].

    [Sidenote: The cause of this error is that men imagine that their
    knowledge is wholly derived from the nature of the things known,
    whereas it is quite the reverse.]

          and þe
  cause of þis errour is. þat of alle þe þinges þat euery           4756

    but by the faculties of the observer.]

    SENSE, REASON, AND INTELLIGENCE.]

    [Sidenote: Man himself is surveyed in divers ways--by the senses,
    by the imagination, by reason, and by the intelligence (of the
    Deity).]

  ¶ and þe man hym self oþer weies wyt byholdiþ hym. {and}
  oþ{er}weyes ymaginac{i}ou{n} {and} oþer weyes resou{n}. {and}     4772
  oþer weyes intelligence.

    [Sidenote: The senses take note of his material figure--the
    imagination considers the form alone, exclusive of the matter.]

          ¶ For þe wit co{m}p{re}he{n}diþ

    [Sidenote: Reason transcends the imaginations, and examining
    existences in general discovers the particular species, but the
    eye of Intelligence soars still higher; for, going beyond the
    bounds of what is general, it surveys the _simple forms_
    themselves, by its own pure and subtle thought:]

    higher power of perception embraces the lower; but the inferior
    cannot attain to the energy of the superior:]

  lower{e} strengthe ne arysith nat in no maner{e} to heyer{e}

    [Sidenote: for the senses cannot go beyond the perception of
    matter; the imagination cannot comprehend existences in general,
    nor can the reason conceive the simple form.]

  i{n}telligence takeþ it.

    [Sidenote: But the Intelligence looking down (as from above) and
    having conceived the form, discerns all things that are below it,
    and comprehends what does not fall within the reach of the other
    faculties of the mind.]

          but þe intelligence þat lokeþ al

    [Sidenote: Without the aid of those faculties Intelligence
    comprehends things _formally_ (_i. e._ by beholding their simple
    forms) by one effort of mind.]

          for it                                                    4796

    sensible things.]

    thus:--]

    [Sidenote: Man is a rational two-footed animal, which, though it
    be a general idea, yet every one knows that man thus defined is
    perceived both by the imagination and the senses, notwithstanding
    that in this instance reason does not make use of imagination or
    the senses, but of her own rational conception.]

          ¶ Man is a resonable t[w]o-footid
  beest. and how so þat þis knowynge [is] vniuersel.

  but it lokiþ it by [a] resonable concepc{i}ou{n}.

    [Sidenote: The imagination also, although it derives its power of
    seeing and forming figures from the senses, yet in the absence and
    without the use of the senses it considers and comprehends all
    sensible things by its own imaginative power.]

          ¶ Also ymaginac{i}ou{n}
  al be it so. þat it takeþ of wit þe bygyny{n}g{us}

    [Sidenote: Do not you see that men attain to the knowledge of
    things more by their own faculties, than by the inherent property
    of things?]

          ¶ sest þou nat þan þat alle

    [Sidenote: Nor is it unreasonable that it should be so--for since
    every judgment is the act of the person judging; every one must
    needs do his own work by the help of his own faculties, and not by
    the aid of foreign power.]

  derke in hire sentences. þ{a}t is to sein philosophers þat
  hyȝten stoiciens.

    [Sidenote: who taught that images of things obvious to the senses
    were imprinted on the mind by external objects, and that the soul
    is at first like a mirror or a clean parchment, free from figures
    and letters.]

          þat wenden þat ymages [{and}] sensibilites
  þat is to sein sensible ymaginac{i}ou{n}s. or ellys ymaginac{i}ou{n}
  of sensible þinges were{n} i{n}p{re}ntid in to soules             4832
  fro bodies wiþ oute forþe. ¶ As who seiþ þat þilke
  stoiciens wenden þ{a}t þe soule hadde ben naked of it
  self. as a mirour or a clene p{ar}chemyn. so þat alle
  fygures mosten [fyrst] comen fro þinges fro wiþ oute in to        4836

  þe table of wex. or in p{ar}chemyn þat ne haþ no figure     [[pg 167]]
  [ne] note in it.

    [Sidenote: But if the mind is passive in receiving the impressions
    of outward objects, whence proceeds the knowledge by which the
    mind comprehends all things?]

          _Glosa._ But now arguiþ boece aȝeins þat                  4841

    [Sidenote: Whence its force to conceive individual existences, to
    separate those things when known, to unite divided things, and to
    choose and change its path, soaring to the highest and descending
    to the lowest things--and returning to itself, to confute false
    things by the true?]

          and whennes is þilke strengþe þat

  trewe þinges.

    [Sidenote: This cause is more efficacious and powerful to see and
    to know things, than that cause which receives the characters
    impressed like servile matter.]

          ¶ Certys þis strengþe is cause more
  efficient {and} mochel more myȝty to seen {and} to knowe

    [Sidenote: Yet the sense in the living body excites and moves the
    mental powers; as when the light striking the eyes causes them to
    see, or as the voice rushing into the ear excites hearing.]

          algates

  ryȝt so as voys or soune hurtliþ to þe eres {and} co{m}moeuiþ

    [Sidenote: Then is the force of thought excited; it calls forth
    the images within itself, and adds to them the outward forms,
    blending external images with the counterparts concealed within.]

Q{UO}D SI IN CORPORIB{US} SENCIEND{IS}.

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 38.]]

*QUESTIO.

  [Sidenote: [The .5.^the p{ro}se.]]

    [Sidenote: Although there are in objects certain qualities which
    strike externally upon the senses, and put their instruments in
    motion; although the passive impression upon the body precedes the
    action of the mind,]

  ++But what [yif] þat in bodies to be{n} feelid þat is
  to sein in þe takynge of knowelechinge of bodyly
  þinges. and al be it so þat þe qualites of bodies þ{a}t ben       4875
  obiect fro wiþ oute forþe moeuen {and} entalenten þe instrumentes
  of þe wittes.

    [Sidenote: and although the former rouses the latter to action,
    yet if in the perception of bodily things, the soul is not by the
    impression of external things made to know these things, but by
    its own power judgeth of these bodily impressions,]

          and al be it so þat þe passiou{n}
  of þe body þat is to seyn þe witte [or the] suffrau{n}ce
  [goth to-forn the strengthe of the workynge corage / the
  which passiou{n} or suffraunce] clepiþ furþe þe dede of           4880
  þe þouȝt in hym self. {and} moeueþ {and} exiteþ in þis

  þat i{n} sensible bodies as I haue seid oure corage nis nat
  ytauȝt or enp{re}ntid by passiou{n} to knowe þise þinges.         4884
  but demiþ {and} knoweþ of hys owen strengþe þe passiou{n}
  or suffrau{n}ce subiect to þe body.

    [Sidenote: how much more shall those pure spiritual beings (as God
    or angels) discern things by an act of their understanding alone,
    without the aid of impressions from external objects?]

          Moche more þan þoo
  þinges þat ben absolut {and} quit fram alle talentȝ or
  affecc{i}ou{n}s of bodies. as god or hys aungels ne folwen        4888
  nat in discernynge þinges obiect from wiþ oute forþe.
  but þei accomplissen {and} speden þe dede of hir þouȝt

    [Sidenote: For this reason, then, there are several sorts of
    knowing distributed among various beings.]

          by þis resou{n}.
  ¶ þan þere comen many manere knowynges
  to dyu{er}se {and} differy{n}g substaunces.

    [Sidenote: For sense (or sensation) destitute of all other
    knowledge is allotted to those creatures that have no motion, as
    shell-fish.]

          for þe wit                                                4892

    [Sidenote: But imagination is given to such brutes capable of
    motion, and having in some degree the power of desiring or
    refusing.]

          but þe ymaginac{i}ou{n}
  comeþ to remuable bestes þat seme{n} to han talent

    [Sidenote: Reason, however, is the attribute of man alone, as
    Intelligence is that of God.]

          but resou{n} is al only to
  þe lynage of mankynde ryȝt as i{n}telligence is oonly þe          4900
  deuyne nature.

    [Sidenote: Hence His (i. e. God’s) knowledge exceeds all other,
    comprehending both what belongs to His own nature, and what is
    comprehended by all inferior creatures.]

    THE POWERS OF SENSE AND IMAGINATION.]

    [Sidenote: But how shall it be then, if sense and imagination
    oppose reason, affirming that the general idea of things, which
    reason thinks it so perfectly sees, is nothing?]

  but how shal it þan be yif þat wit {and} ymaginac{i}ou{n}

  vniuersel þinges. þat resou{n} weneþ to seen þat it nis           4908

    [Sidenote: For what falls under the cognisance of the senses and
    imagination cannot be general.]

          for wit {and} ymaginac{i}ou{n} seyn þat þat. þat
  is sensible or ymaginable it ne may nat ben vniuersel.
  þan is eiþer þe iugement of resou{n} [soth]. ne þat

  whiche þat lookeþ {and} co{m}p{re}hendiþ. þat þat is
  sensible {and} synguler as uniuersele.

    [Sidenote: But if reason should answer to this--that in her idea
    of what is general she comprehends whatever is sensible and
    imaginable; but as to the senses and imagination, they cannot
    attain to the knowledge of what is general, since their knowledge
    is confined to material figures; and therefore in all real
    knowledge of things we must give the greatest credit to that
    faculty which has a more steadfast and perfect judgment of
    things.]

          and ȝif þat resou{n}                                      4916

    REASON SHOULD SUBMIT TO INTELLIGENCE.]

    [Sidenote: The case is entirely similar when human reason thinks
    the Divine Intelligence cannot behold future events in any other
    way than she herself is capable of perceiving them.]

  semblable þinge is it þat þe resou{n} of mankynde                 4932
  ne weneþ nat þat þe deuyne intelligence byholdeþ or
  knoweþ þinges to comen. but ryȝt as þe resou{n} of mankynde
  knoweþ hem.

    [Sidenote: For thus you argue:--
    What things are not necessitated cannot be foreknown; therefore
    there is no prescience of these things, for, if there were,
    everything would be fixed by an absolute necessity.]

          for þou arguist {and} seist þus. þat

    [Sidenote: If it were possible to enjoy the intelligence of the
    Deity, we should then deem it right that sense and imagination
    should yield to reason, and also judge it proper that human reason
    should submit to the Divine Intelligence.]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 38 _b_.]]

          but certys yif we myȝte{n} han þe

    [Sidenote: Let us, therefore, strive to elevate ourselves to the
    height of the supreme intelligence--there shall reason see what
    she cannot discover in herself; and that is in what manner the
    prescience of God sees and defines all things; although they have
    no certain event; and she will see that this is no mere
    conjecture, but rather simple, supreme, and unlimited knowledge.]

  [Sidenote: [The 6^te p{ro}se {and} the laste.]]

    [Sidenote: Since everything which is known is not, as I have
    shown, perceived by its own inherent properties, but by the
    faculties of those comprehending them, let us now examine the
    disposition of the Divine nature.]

  ++ÞEr-fore þan as I haue shewed a litel her byforne þat           4976
  al þinge þat is ywist nis nat knowen by hys nature
  p{ro}pre. but by þe nature of he{m} þat comp{re}henden it.
  ¶ Lat vs loke now in as moche as it is leueful to vs. as
  who seiþ lat vs loken now as we mowen whiche þ{a}t þe             4980
  estat is of þe deuyne substaunce so þat we mowen [ek]
  knowen what his science is.

    [Sidenote: All rational creatures agree in affirming that God is
    eternal.]

          þe comune iugement of alle
  creatures resonables þan is þis þat god is eterne. lat vs
  considere þa{n} what is et{er}nite. For certys þat shal           4984
  shewen vs to-gidre þe deuyne nature {and} þe deuyne
  science

    [Sidenote: And eternity is a full, total, and perfect possession
    of a life which shall never end. This will appear more clearly
    from a comparison with temporal things.]

          ¶ Eternite þan is p{er}fit possessiou{n} {and} al
  togidre of lijf interminable {and} þat sheweþ more clerely
  by þe co{m}parisou{n} or collac{i}ou{n} of temp{or}el þinges.     4988

    [Sidenote: Temporal existence proceeds from the past to the
    present, and thence to the future.]

  for al þing þat lyueþ in tyme it is p{re}sent {and} p{ro}cediþ fro
  preteritȝ in to fut{ur}es. þat is to sein. fro tyme passed
  in to tyme comynge.

    [Sidenote: And there is nothing under the law of time, which can
    at once comprehend the whole space of its existence.]

          ne þer nis no þing establissed i{n}
  tyme þat may enbracen to-gidre al þe space of hys lijf.           4992

    [Headnote:
    THE WORLD IS NOT ETERNAL.]

    [Sidenote: Having lost _yesterday_ it does not as yet enjoy
    _to-morrow_; and as for _to-day_ it consists only in the present
    transitory moment.]

  for certys ȝit ne haþ it nat taken þe tyme of þe morwe.
  {and} it haþ lost þat of ȝister-day. and certys in þe lijf
  of þis day ȝe ne lyuen no more but ryȝt
                  as in þis moeueable                         [[pg 172]]
  {and} t{ra}nsitorie moment.

    [Sidenote: Whatever, therefore, is subjected to a temporal
    condition, as Aristotle thought of the world, may be without
    beginning and without end; and although its duration may extend to
    an infinity of time, yet it cannot rightly be called eternal: for
    it doth not comprehend at once the whole extent of its infinite
    duration, having no knowledge of things future which are not yet
    arrived.]

          þan þilke þinge þat suffriþ                               4996
  temp{or}el condic{i}ou{n}. a[l]þough{e} þat [it] bygan neuer
  to be. ne þough{e} it neu{er}e cese forto be. as aristotle
  demde of þe worlde. and al þouȝ þat þe lif of it be
  strecchid wiþ infinite of tyme.

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 39.]]

          ȝit al*gates nis it no                                    5000
  swiche þing þat men myȝten trowen by ryȝt þat it is
  eterne. for al þouȝ þat it comp{re}hende {and} embrace þe
  space of life infinite. ȝit algates ne [em]braceþ it nat þe
  space of þe lif alto-gidre. for it ne haþ nat þe fut{ur}es        5004
  þat ne ben nat ȝit. ne it ne haþ no lenger þe p{re}t{er}itȝ
  þat ben ydon or ypassed.

    [Sidenote: For what is eternal must be always present to itself
    and master of itself, and have always with it the infinite
    succession of time.]

          but þilke þing þan þat haþ
  {and} co{m}prehendiþ to-gidre alle þe plente of þe lif i{n}terminable.
  to whom þere ne failiþ nat of þe fut{ur}e.                        5008
  {and} to whom þer nis nat of þe p{re}t{er}it escapid nor
  ypassed. þilk[e] same is ywitnessed or yproued by ryȝt
  to ben eterne. and it byhoueþ by necessite þat þilke
  þinge be alwey p{re}sent to hym self {and} co{m}potent. as        5012
  who seiþ alwey p{re}sent to hym self {and} so myȝty þat al
  by ryȝt at hys plesaunce. {and} þ{a}t he haue al p{re}sent
  þe infinit of þe moeuable tyme.

    [Sidenote: Therefore some philosophers, who had heard that Plato
    believed that this world had neither beginning nor end, falsely
    concluded, that the created universe was coeternal with its
    Creator.]

          wherfore som men
  trowe{n} wrongefully þat whan þei heren þat it semid[e]           5016
  to plato þat þis worlde ne had[de] neuer bygynnynge
  of tyme. ne þat it neu{er}e shal haue faylynge. þei wenen
  i{n} þis man{er}e þat þis worlde ben maked coet{er}ne wiþ
  his makere. as who seiþ. þei wenen þat þis worlde {and}           5020
  god ben maked to-gidre eterne. and it is a wrongful
  wenynge.

    [Sidenote: But it is one thing to be conducted through a life of
    infinite duration, which was Plato’s opinion of the world, and
    another thing to comprehend at once the whole extent of this
    duration as present which, it is manifest, can only belong to the
    Divine mind.]

          for oþer þing is it to ben yladd by lif interminable
  as plato graunted[e] to þe worlde. {and} oþer
  þing is it to embracen to-gidre alle þe p{re}sence to þe lif      5024
  interminable. þe whiche þing it is clere {and} manifest
  þat it is p{ro}pre to þe deuine þouȝt.                      [[pg 173]]

    [Sidenote: Nor ought it to seem to us that God is prior to and
    more ancient than his creatures by the space of time, but rather
    by the simple and undivided properties of his nature.]

          ne it ne sholde nat
  semen to vs þat god is elder þan þinges þat ben ymaked
  by quantite of tyme. but raþer by þe p{ro}prete of hys            5028
  symple nature.

    [Sidenote: The infinite progression of temporal things imitates
    the ever-present condition of an immovable life:]

          for þis ilke infinit[e] moeuyng of temp{or}el
  þinges folwiþ þis p{re}sentarie estat of þe lijf i{n}moeueable.

    GOD IS ETERNAL.]

    [Sidenote: and since it cannot copy nor equal it from an immovable
    and simply present state, it passes into motion and into an
    infinite measure of past and future time.]

  {and} so as it ne may nat contrefeten it ne feyne{n}
  it ne ben euene lyke to it. for þe inmoeueablete. þat is          5032
  to seyn þat is i{n} þe eternite of god. ¶ it faileþ {and}

  of god. {and} disencresiþ to þe infinite quantite of
  fut{ur}e {and} of p{re}terit.

    [Sidenote: But since it cannot possess at once the whole extent of
    its duration, yet, as it never ceases wholly to be, it faintly
    emulates _that_ whose perfection it can neither attain nor
    express, by attaching itself to the present fleeting moment,
    which, because it resembles the durable present time, imparts to
    those things that partake of it an appearance of existence.]

          {and} so as it ne may nat han togidre                     5036

  swiche manere þinges as it bitidiþ to þat it semeþ hem
  þat þise þinges han ben {and} ben

    [Sidenote: But as it cannot stop or abide it pursues its course
    through infinite time, and by gliding along it continues its
    duration, the plenitude of which it could not comprehend, by
    abiding in a permanent state.]

          {and} for [þ{a}t] þe p{re}sence
  of swiche litel moment ne may nat dwelle þer-for
  [it] rauyssid[e] {and} took þe infinit[e] wey of tyme. þat        5048

  for þat it sholde continue þe lif in goynge of þe whiche
  lif it ne myȝt[e] nat embrace þe plente in dwellynge.

    [Sidenote: If we would follow Plato in giving things their right
    names, let us say that God is _eternal_ and the world
    _perpetual_.]

  {and} for þi yif we willen putte worþi name[s] to þinges          5052
  {and} folwen plato. lat vs seyn þa{n} soþely þat god is
  et{er}ne. {and} þat þe worlde is p{er}petuel.

    [Sidenote: His knowledge, surpassing the progression of time, is
    ever present, containing the infinite space of past and future
    times, and embraces in his clear insight all things, as if they
    were now transacting.]

          þan syn þat

    [Sidenote: Prescience is, then, a foreknowledge, not of what is to
    come, but of the present and _never-failing now_ (in which God
    sees all things as if immovably present).]

    DEFINITION OF PRESCIENCE.]

  but þou shalt deme{n} [it] more ryȝtfully þat it is science
  of presence or of instaunce þat neuer ne fayleþ.

    [Sidenote: Therefore _foreknowledge_ is not so applicable a term
    as _providence_--for God looks down upon all things from the
    summit of the universe.]

  for whiche it nis nat ycleped p{ro}uidence but it sholde raþer    5068

  it were fro þe heye heyȝte of þinges.

    [Sidenote: Do you think that God imposes a necessity on things by
    beholding them? It is not so in human affairs.]

          whi axest þou þan
  or why disputest þou þan þat þilke þinges ben don by              5072

    [Sidenote: Does your view of an action lay any necessity upon it?]

          for addiþ þi byholdynge any necessite to þilke            5076
  þinges þat þou byholdest p{re}sent.

    [Sidenote: _B._ No.]

          ¶ Nay q{uo}d I.

    [Sidenote: _P._ By parity of reason it is clear that whilst you
    see only some things in a limited instant, God sees all things in
    his ever-present time.]

  _p._ Certys þan yif men myȝte maken any digne comparisou{n}
  or collac{i}ou{n} of þe p{re}sence diuine. {and} of þe p{re}

  temp{or}el presente. ryȝt so seeþ god alle þinges by hys
  eterne p{re}sent.

    [Sidenote: His Divine prescience therefore does not change the
    nature of things--but only beholds those things as present to him
    which shall in time be produced.]

          ¶ wherfore þis dyuyne p{re}science ne
  chaungeþ nat þe nature ne þe p{ro}prete of þinges but
  byholdeþ swyche þinges present to hym ward. as þei                5084

    THE NATURE OF DIVINE PRESCIENCE.]

    [Sidenote: The eye of God, seeing all things, doth not alter the
    properties of things, for everything is present to him, though its
    temporal event is future.]

  ¶ Ryȝt so þan [the] deuyne lokynge byholdynge

  þinges þat ben certeynely p{re}sent to hy{m} ward. but as
  to þe condic{i}ou{n} of tyme for soþe þei ben fut{ur}e.           5096

    [Sidenote: When God knows that anything is to be, he knows at the
    same time that it is not under the necessity of being--but this is
    not conjecture, but certain knowledge founded upon truth.]

  for whiche it folwiþ þat þis nis non oppiniou{n}. but raþer a
  stedfast knowyng ystrengeþed by soþenes. þat whan
  þat god knoweþ any þinge to be he ne vnwoot nat þat
  þilke þinge wanteþ necessite to be. þis is to seyn þat            5100
  whan þat god knoweþ any þinge to bitide. he woot wel
  þat it ne haþ no necessite to bitide.

    [Sidenote: If you insist that _what God foresees shall and must
    happen; and that which cannot do otherwise than happen, must needs
    happen_, and so bind me to admit a necessity, I must confess that
    things are under such a restraint; but it is a truth that we
    scarce can comprehend, unless we be acquainted with the Divine
    counsels.]

          {and} yif þ{o}u seist
  here þat þilke þinge þat god seeþ to bytide it ne may
  nat vnbytide. as who seiþ it mot bitide. ¶ and þilke              5104
  þinge þat þat ne may nat vnbytide it mot bitide by
  necessite. and þat þou streine me to þis name of necessite.
  certys I wol wel confessen {and} byknowe a þinge of
  ful sadde trouþe. but vnneþ shal þere any wyȝt [mowe]             5108
  seen it or comen þer-to. but yif þat he be byholder of þe
  deuyne þouȝte.

    [Sidenote: For I will answer you thus. That the thing which is to
    happen in relation to the Divine knowledge is necessary; but,
    considered in its own nature, seems free and absolute.]

          ¶ for I wol answer{e} þe þus. þat þilke
  þinge þat is future whan it is referred to þe deuyne              5111

  in hys owen kynde me{n} sen it [is] vtterly fre
  {and} absolut from alle necessite.

    [Sidenote: There are two kinds of necessity--one simple; as men
    must necessarily die--the other is conditional, as if you know a
    man walks he must necessarily walk--for that which is known cannot
    be otherwise than what it is apprehended to be.]

          for certys þer ben two
  maneres of necessites. þat oon necessite is symple as
  þus. þat it byhoueþ by necessite þat alle men be mortal           5116

    necessity, for the nature of the thing itself does not here
    constitute the necessity, but the necessity arises from the
    conjunction of the condition.]

  so þat whan he gooþ þat it is necessarie þat he gooþ.

    [Sidenote: So everything that is present to the eye of Providence
    must assuredly be, although there is nothing in its own nature to
    constitute that necessity.]

  ¶ Ryȝt on þis same manere þan. yif þat þe p{ur}ueaunce

  owen nature.

    [Sidenote: Since God beholds all future events proceeding from
    free-will as actually present--these events in relation to Divine
    sight are necessary--yet in relation to themselves they are
    absolutely free.]

    although they happen,]

    happened they had it in their power not to happen.]

  ȝit algates ne lese þei nat hire p{ro}pre nature ne
  beynge. by þe whiche first or þat þei were doon þei

    [Sidenote: But it is a thing of no moment then, whether things are
    necessary in their own nature or not, since by the condition of
    the Divine knowledge they fell out as if they were necessitated.]

          _Boece._ what is þis

  hire p{ro}pre nature. so as þei comen in alle maneres in

    lately given you, of the man walking, &c.]

    whereas that of the latter was altogether free.]

          naþeles þat oon of hem or it was ydon it
  byhoued[e] by necessite þat it was ydon. but nat þat              5152

  {and} so{m}me descendiþ of þe power of þe doers as þe man         5156
  walkynge.

    [Sidenote: _B._ Then I did not go from the truth when I said that
    some things referred to the Divine knowledge are necessary, while
    considered in themselves they are not under the bond of
    necessity.]

          ¶ þan seide I. no wronge þat yif þat þise
  þinges ben referred to þe deuyne knowynge þan ben þei
  necessarie. {and} yif þei ben considered by he{m} selfe þan
  ben þei absolut from þe bonde of necessite.

    [Sidenote: In the same way everything that is an object of sense
    is _general_ when considered in relation to reason--but particular
    when considered by itself.]

          ryȝt so [as]                                              5160

    can deceive providence by changing that which she hath foreseen I
    would do.]

    GOD’S KNOWLEDGE FIXED AND UNCHANGED.]

    [Sidenote: _P._ You may perhaps alter your purpose--but as
    providence takes note of your intentions, you cannot deceive her;
    for you cannot escape the divine prescience though you have the
    power, through a free-will, to vary and diversify your actions.]

    according to the mutability of my disposition, and the
    apprehensions of the Deity fluctuated with my changing purposes?]

          ¶ But þou mayst seyn

    [Sidenote: No, indeed! The view of the Deity foreruns every future
    event, and brings it back into the presence of his own knowledge,
    which does not vary, as you imagine, to conform to your caprices,
    but remaining fixed, at once foresees and comprehends all your
    changes.]

    from the simplicity of his own nature.]

    AN ANSWER TO FORMER OBJECTIONS.]

    [Sidenote: Here, then, is an answer to your former objection--that
    it is folly to think that our future actions and events are the
    causes of the prescience of God.]

  ¶ and her by is assoiled þilke þing þat þou                       5192

    [Sidenote: For the Divine mind, embracing and comprehending all
    things by a present knowledge, plans and directs all things and is
    not dependent upon futurity.]

    [Sidenote: [* fol. 41 _b_.]]

          ¶ For c{er}tys *þis strengþe of þe deuyne

    [Sidenote: Since no necessity is imposed upon things by the Divine
    prescience, there remains to men an inviolable freedom of will.]

          {and} syn þat þise þinges
  ben þus. þat is to seyn syn þat necessite nis nat in

    [Sidenote: And those laws are just which assign rewards and
    punishments to men possessing free-will.]

  ne þe lawes ne p{ur}pose nat wikkedly meedes {and} peynes
  to þe willynges of men þat ben vnbounde {and} quit of
  alle necessite.

    [Sidenote: Moreover, God, who sits on high, foreknows all things,
    and the eternal presence of his knowledge concurs with the future
    quality of our actions, dispensing rewards to good and punishments
    to evil men.]

          ¶ And god byholder {and} forwiter of                      5204

    [Sidenote: Nor are our hopes and prayers reposed in, and addressed
    to God in vain, which when they are sincere cannot be
    inefficacious nor unsuccessful.]

    [Sidenote: Resist and turn from vice--honour and love virtue,
    exalt your mind to God (the truest hope), offer up your prayers
    with humility.]

  ¶ wiþstond þan {and} eschewe þou vices. worshippe
  {and} loue þou vertus. areise þi corage to ryȝtful hoopes.        5212

    [Sidenote: If you are sincere you will feel that you are under an
    obligation to lead a good and virtuous life, inasmuch as all your
    actions and works are done in the presence of an all-discerning
    Judge.]

oþir. but þat þat nis nat p{er}fit men may seen apertly þat it nis nat
souereyne. þe þinges þan þat ben souereynely goode ne mowen by no wey
ben diuerse. ¶ But I haue wel conclude þat blisfulnesse {and} god ben
[the] souereyne goode. For whiche it mot nedes be þat souereyne
blisfulnesse is souerey[ne] dyuynite. ¶ No þing q{uo}d I nis more
soþefast þan þis ne more ferme by resou{n}. ne a more worþi þing þan god

þise geometriens whan þei han shewed her p{ro}posiciou{n}s ben wont to

maked blysful. {and} blisfulnesse is diuinite. ¶ þan is it manifest
{and} open þat by þe gety{n}g of diuinite men ben makid blisful. ryȝt as
by þe getynge of iustice . . . {and} by þe getyng of sapience þei ben
maked wise. ¶ Ryȝt so nedes by þe semblable resou{n} wha{n} þei han
getyn diuinite þei ben maked goddys. þan is euery blisful man god. ¶ But
certis by nature. þer nys but oon god. but by þe p{ar}ticipac{i}ou{n}s
of diuinite þere ne letteþ ne disturbeþ no þing þat þer ne ben many
goddes. ¶ þis is q{uo}d .I. a faire þing {and} a p{re}cious. ¶ Clepe it
as þ{o}u wolt. be it corolarie or porisme or mede of coroune or
declarynges ¶ Certys q{uo}d she no þing nis fairer. þan is þe þing þat
by resou{n} sholde ben added to þise forseide þinges. what þing q{uo}d
.I. ¶ So q{uo}d she as it semeþ þat blisfulnesse conteniþ many þinges.
it were forto witen wheþir [þ{a}t] alle þise þinges maken or conioignen
as a maner body of blysfulnesse by diuersite of parties or [of]

acomplise by hy{m} self þe substaunce of blisfulnesse. so þat alle þise

forsoþe q{uo}d .I. {and} þat souereyne goode. ¶ Adde þan q{uo}d she
þilke goode þat is maked blisfulnes to alle þe forseide þinges. ¶ For
þilke same blisfulnesse þat is demed to ben souereyne suffisaunce. þilke
self is souereyne power. souereyne reuerence. sou{er}eyne clernesse or
noblesse {and} souereyne delit. what seist þou þan of alle þise þinges.
þat is to seyne. suffisance power {and} þise oþer þinges. ben þei þan as

I vndirstonde wel q{uo}d .I. what þou p{ur}posest to seke. but I
desijr[e] to herkene þat þou shewe it me. _p._ Take now þus þe
discressiou{n} of þis questiou{n} q{uo}d she. yif al þise þinges q{uo}d
she weren membris to felicite. þan weren þei diu{er}se þat oon fro þat
oþer. ¶ And swiche is þe nat{ur}e of p{ar}ties or of membris. þat
dyuerse me{m}bris compounen a body. ¶ Certis q{uo}d I it haþ wel ben
shewed her byforne. þat alle þise þinges ben alle on þing. þan ben þei
none membris q{uo}d she. for ellys it sholde seme þat blisfulnesse were
conioigned al of one membre alone. but þat is a þi{n}g þat may nat ben

remenaunt of þe questiou{n}. þis is ope{n} {and} clere q{uo}d she. þat
alle oþer þinges ben referred {and} brouȝt to goode. ¶ For þerfore is
suffisaunce requered. For it is demed to ben good. {and} forþi is power
requered. for men trowen also þat it be goode. and þis same þing mowe we
þinken {and} coueiten of reuerence {and} of noblesse {and} of delit. þan
is souereyne good þe soume {and} þe cause of alle þat auȝt[e] be
desired. forwhi þilke þing þat wiþ-holdeþ no good in it self ne
semblaunce of goode it ne may nat wel in no manere be desired ne
requered. {and} þe contrarie. For þouȝ þat þinges by hir nature ne ben
nat goode algates yif men wene þat þei be{n} goode ȝit ben þei desired
as þouȝ [þ{a}t] þei were verrayly goode. {and} þerfore is it þat men
auȝte{n} to wene by ryȝt þat bounte be souereyne fyn {and} þe cause of
alle þinges þat ben to requeren. ¶ But certis þilke þ{a}t is cause for
whiche men requeren any þing. ¶ it semeþ þat þilke same þing be most
desired. as þus yif þat a wyȝt wolde ryde for cause of hele. he ne
desireþ nat so mychel þe moeuyng to ryden as þe effect of his heele. Now
þan syn þat alle þinges ben requered for þe grace of good. þei ne ben
[nat] desired of alle folk more þan þe same good ¶ But we han graunted
þat blysfulnesse is þat þing for whiche þat alle þise oþer þinges ben
desired. þan is it þus þat certis only blisfulnesse is requered {and}
desired ¶ By whiche þing it sheweþ clerely þat good {and} blisfulnesse
is al oone {and} þe same substaunce. ¶ I se nat q{uo}d I wher fore þat
men myȝt[en] discorden in þis. _p._ {and} we han shewed þat god {and}
verrey blysfulnesse is al oon þing ¶ þat is soþe q{uod} .I. þan mowe we
conclude sikerly þ{a}t þe substaunce of god is set in þilke same good
{and} in noon oþer place.

{and} god ȝeueþ {and} dep{ar}tiþ to oþer folk p{ro}sp[er]ites {and}

¶ And many oþer folk han bouȝt honorable renoune of þis worlde by þe

no man ne wondreþ. For alle me{n} wenen þat þei han wel deserued it.
{and} þei ben of wicked m{er}ite of whiche shrewes þe to{ur}ment som

þinge þat þat ne may nat vnbytide it mot bitide by necessite. and þat
þou streine me to þis name of necessite. certys I wol wel confessen
{and} byknowe a þinge of ful sadde trouþe. but vnneþ shal þere any wyȝt
[mowe] seen it or comen þer-to. but yif þat he be byholder of þe deuyne
þouȝte. ¶ for I wol answer{e} þe þus. þat þilke þinge þat is future whan
it is referred to þe deuyne knowy{n}g þan is it necessarie. but certys
whan it is vndirstonden in hys owen kynde me{n} sen it [is] vtterly fre
{and} absolut from alle necessite. for certys þer ben two maneres of
necessites. þat oon necessite is symple as þus. þat it byhoueþ by
necessite þat alle men be mortal or dedely. an oþ{er} necessite is
condicionel as þus. yif þou wost þat a man walkiþ. it byhoueþ by
necessite þat he walke. þilke þinge þan þat any wyȝt haþ yknowe to be.
it ne may ben non oþer weyes þan he knoweþ it to be. ¶ but þis
condicioun ne draweþ nat wiþ hir þilke necessite symple. For certys þis
necessite condicionel. þe p{ro}pre nature of it ne makeþ it nauȝt. but
þe adiecc{i}ou{n} of þe condic{i}ou{n} makiþ it. for no necessite ne
constreyneþ a man to [gon / þ{a}t] gooþ by his p{ro}pre wille. al be it
so þat whan he gooþ þat it is necessarie þat he gooþ. þan mot þilke
þinge be by necessite. al þouȝ þat it ne haue no necessite of hys owen
nature. ¶ Ryȝt on þis same manere þan. yif þat þe p{ur}ueaunce of god
seeþ any þing p{re}sent. but certys þe fut{ur}es þat bytyden by fredom
of arbitre god seeþ hem alle to-gidre p{re}sentȝ. þise þinges þan [yif]
þei ben referred to þe deuyne syȝt. þan ben þei maked necessarie to þe
condic{i}ou{n} of þe deuyne knowynge. but certys yif þilke þinges ben
considred by hem self þei ben absolut of necessite. {and} ne forleten
nat ne cesen nat of þe liberte of hire owe{n} natur{e}. þan certys wiþ
outen doute alle þe þing{us} shollen be doon whiche þat god woot by-forn
þat þei ben to comen. but so{m}me of hem comen {and} bitiden of [free]
arbitre or of fre wille. þat al be it so þat þei bytiden. ȝit algates ne
lese þei nat hire p{ro}pre nature ne beynge. by þe whiche first or þat
þei were doon þei hadden power nat to han bitidd. _Boece._ what is þis
to seyn þa{n} q{uo}d I. þat þinges ne ben nat necessarie by hire
p{ro}pre nature. so as þei comen in alle maneres in þe lykenesse of
necessite by þe condic{i}ou{n} of þe deuyne science. {Ph}ilosoph{ie}.
þis is þe difference q{uo}d she. þat þo þinges þat I p{ur}posed[e] þe a
litel here byforn. þat is to seyn þe sonne arysynge {and} þe man
walkynge þat þerwhiles þat þilke þinges ben ydon. þei ne myȝten nat ben
vndon. naþeles þat oon of hem or it was ydon it byhoued[e] by necessite
þat it was ydon. but nat þat oþ{er}. ryȝt so it is here þat þe þinges
þat god haþ p{re}sent. wiþ outen doute þei shulle ben. but so{m}me of
hem descendiþ of þe nature of þinges as þe sonne arysynge. {and} so{m}me
descendiþ of þe power of þe doers as þe man walkynge. ¶ þan seide I. no
wronge þat yif þat þise þinges ben referred to þe deuyne knowynge þan
ben þei necessarie. {and} yif þei ben considered by he{m} selfe þan ben
þei absolut from þe bonde of necessite. ryȝt so [as] alle þinges þat
appiereþ or sheweþ to þe wittes yif þou referre it to resou{n} it is
vniuersel. {and} yif þou referre it or look[e] it to it self. þan is it
sy{n}guler. but now yif þou seist þus þ{a}t yif it be in my power to
chaunge my p{ur}pose. þan shal I voide þe p{ur}ueaunce of god. whan þat
p{er}auenture I shal han chau{n}ged þo þinges þat he knoweþ byforn. þan
shal I answere þe þus ¶ Certys þou maist wel chaungen þi p{ur}pos but
for as mochel as þe p{re}sent soþenesse of þe deuyne p{ur}ueaunce
byholdeþ þat þou mayst chau{n}ge{n} þi p{ur}pose. {and} wheþir þou wolt

of þe p{re}sent eye. al þouȝ þat þou tourne þi self by þi fre wille in

be. shal nat þe dyuyne science ben chaunged by my disposic{i}ou{n} whan
þat I wol o þing now {and} now an oþer. {and} þilke p{re}science ne
semeþ it nat to enterchau{n}ge stoundes of knowynges. as who seiþ. ne
shal it nat seme to vs þat þe deuyne p{re}science enterchaungeþ hys
dyuers stoundes of knowynge. so þat it knowe so{m}me tyme o þing {and}
so{m}me tyme þe contrarie. ¶ No for soþe. [q{uod} I] for þe deuyne syȝt
renneþ to-forne {and} seeþ alle fut{ur}es {and} clepeþ hem aȝein {and}
reto{ur}niþ hem to þe p{re}sence of hys p{ro}pre knowynge. ne he ne
entrechaungeþ nat [so] as þou wenest þe stoundes of forknowyng [as] now

sen alle þinges. god ne haþ nat take{n} it of þe bitydynge of þinges
forto come. but of hys p{ro}pre symplicite. ¶ and her by is assoiled
þilke þing þat þou puttest a litel her byforne. þat is to seyne þat it
is vnworþi þinge to seyn þat oure futures ȝeuen cause of þe science of
god ¶ For c{er}tys þis strengþe of þe deuyne science whiche þat enbraceþ
alle þinge by his p{re}sentarie knowynge establisseþ manere to alle
þi{n}g{us} {and} it ne awiþ nat to lattere þinges. {and} syn þat þise
þinges ben þus. þat is to seyn syn þat necessite nis nat in þinges by þe

{and} vnwemmed to mortal men. ne þe lawes ne p{ur}pose nat wikkedly
