WHY I WAS IMPRESSED TO WRITE A COOK BOOK.


It must appeal to the judgment of every thinking man and woman that the
human family are more in need of sound, wholesome advice as to what
they should eat and drink than ever before. The number of physicians
and dentists increases each year at an alarming rate, but the aches
and ills of the suffering people do not lessen. Thousands of people
find themselves in a deplorable condition, with stomachs almost worn
out, having depended largely upon predigested foods and a long list of
so-called "dyspepsia cures."

The amount of patent medicines, "sure cures," consumed by the people in
the United States is enormous, and is increasing every year. It must
be apparent to all students of the past century that the people of the
present are not enjoying the same degree of health as our ancestors,
nor have we any assurance that things will improve unless some radical
change is made.

Disease among cattle, poultry, and fish has increased so alarmingly
in the last few years that we should no longer depend on the animal
kingdom for food. We should look to the grains, nuts, vegetables, and
fruits for a better dietary than can be prepared from the flesh of
animals likely to be contaminated with tuberculosis, cancer, and other
diseases.

In writing this book, the author has treated the subject from the
commonly accepted definition of the term vegetarianism, which means
to abstain from flesh food, but allows the use of eggs, milk, and
its products. After years of experience in conducting vegetarian
restaurants in several cities and making a study of the food question,
he thinks he can bestow no greater gift upon the people than to place
before them a book containing instruction in the preparation of
wholesome dishes that will build up in place of tearing down the body.

In this work I do not claim to have reached perfection, nor to have
exhausted the category of wholesome preparations and combinations
within the domain of vegetarianism. In our efforts to teach how to live
without the use of flesh foods, we find we have only begun to discover
the inexhaustible resources of the great vegetable kingdom in the
boundless wealth of varied hygienic foods.

_HYGIENE OF COOKING_


GOOD COOKING

Good cooking is not the result of accident, a species of good luck,
as it were. There is reason in every process; a law governing every
chemical change. A course of medical lectures does not make a
physician, nor will a collection of choice recipes make a cook. There
must be a knowledge of compounding, as well as of compiling; of baking,
as well as of mixing; and above all, one must engage in the real doing.
Theory alone will not suffice; but experience, which practice only can
give, is of the utmost importance.

Mention will be made under this head of those forms of cooking only
which enter into vegetarian cooking as usually understood.


BOILING

The term "boiling," as applied to cookery, means cooking in a boiling
liquid. Many kinds of food need the action of water or other liquid,
combined with heat, to cook them in the best manner, and boiling is
one of the most common forms of cookery. When water becomes too hot
to bear the hand in it with comfort, it has reached one hundred and
fifty degrees, or the scalding point. When there is a gentle tremor
or undulation on the surface, one hundred and eighty degrees, or the
simmering point, is reached. When there is quite a commotion on the
surface of the water, and the bubbles breaking above it throw off
steam or watery vapor, two hundred and twelve degrees, or the boiling
point, is reached. After water reaches the boiling point it becomes no
hotter, no matter how violently it may boil. The excess of heat escapes
in the steam. This important fact is rarely understood by the average
cook, and much fuel is often needlessly wasted because of the mistaken
idea that rapidly boiling water cooks food more quickly.

In all ordinary cooking, simmering is more effective than violent
boiling. The temperature of the water may be slightly raised by
covering the kettle. If sugar or salt or anything to increase its
density, is added to water, it takes longer for it to boil, but
its boiling temperature is higher. This explains why boiling sugar
syrup and boiling salt water are hotter than boiling fresh water.
Boiling effects partial destruction or removal of organic and mineral
impurities found in water, hence the importance of boiling the water
where such impurities exist. Boiling also expels all the air and the
gases which give fresh water its sparkle and vitality. Therefore, the
sooner water is used after it begins to boil, the more satisfactory
will be the cooking.

Fresh water should be used when the object is to extract the flavor, or
soluble parts, as in soups and broths. Salt water should be used when
it is desired to retain the flavor and soluble parts, as in most green
vegetables. Cold water draws out the starch of vegetables. Boiling
water bursts starch grains, and is absorbed by the swelling starch, and
softens the cellulose in cereals and vegetables.


MILK

In cooking some kinds of food, milk is used instead of water. Milk
being thicker than water, less of the steam escapes, and it becomes
hot sooner than water, adheres to the pan, and burns easily. At its
boiling temperature (214 degrees), the casein contained in milk is
slightly hardened, and its fat rendered more difficult of digestion.
By heating milk in a double boiler, these dangers are avoided. It then
only reaches a temperature of 196 degrees, and is called scalded milk.
The process is a form of steaming.


STEAMING

Steaming is a process of cooking food over boiling water. It is a very
satisfactory and convenient method, without much loss of substance. It
takes a longer time than some other ways of cooking, but requires less
attention. There are two methods of cooking by steam: (1) In a steamer,
which is a covered pan, with perforated bottom. This is placed over
boiling water, and the steam carries the heat directly to the food. (2)
By means of a double boiler. By this method the heat is conveyed from
the boiling water, through the inner boiler to the food. When cooking
by steam, the water should boil steadily until the food is done. Watery
vegetables are made drier by steaming, and flour mixtures develop a
different flavor than when baked.


STEWING

Stewing is cooking in a small quantity of water at a low temperature
for a long time, and is a form of boiling. The food loses less
nutriment when stewed than when rapidly boiled.


BAKING

Baking is cooking by means of dry heat, as in a close oven. The
closely-confined heat of the oven develops flavors which are entirely
different from those obtained by other forms of cooking. The baking
of many kinds of food is as important as the mixing, and every cook
should thoroughly understand how to regulate the oven. Nearly all
flour mixtures, as bread, cakes, and many kinds of pudding, are more
wholesome when baked than when cooked in any other way.


BRAIZING

Braizing is a combination of stewing and baking. Meat cooked in a
closely-covered stew-pan, so that it retains its own flavor and those
of the vegetables and flavorings put with it, is braized. Braized
dishes are highly esteemed.


BROILING

Broiling, meaning "to burn," is cooking directly over, or in front of,
the clear fire, and is the hottest form of cooking. The intense heat,
combined with the free action of the air, produces a fine flavor quite
unlike that obtained in any other way. Pan broiling is broiling on a
hot surface instead of over hot coals.




_SALADS_


SALADS

All green vegetables that are eaten raw and dressed with acid, salt,
and oil, are included in the list of salads, and they should always be
served crisp and cool. Wash salad greens carefully, allowing them to
stand in cold or iced water until crisp. Drain and wipe dry with a soft
towel, taking care not to bruise the leaves, and keep in cool place
till serving time. If they are not thoroughly dried, the water will
collect in the bottom of the dish and ruin any dressing used.

Pare cucumbers thickly, and remove a thick slice from each end; cut
into thin slices, or into one-half inch dice, and keep in cold water
until ready to serve, then drain thoroughly; crisp celery in cold water
also.

Pare tomatoes, and keep in a cold place, and sprinkle with chopped ice
at serving time. The list of vegetables suitable for salads is so long
that the question of kind is wholly a matter of choice. Asparagus,
peas, string beans, beets, cauliflower, etc., are all well utilized
in salads. Freshly cooked vegetables or left-overs may be used, but
all cooked vegetables must be cold and perfectly tender. By deftly
combining these left-overs with the favorite dressing, there is
material for a delicious and economical salad, to which the somewhat
aristocratic name of macedoine salad may be given. This salad may
consist of a few or many kinds of vegetables, any combination pleasing
alike to the eye and the palate being permissible, and if care is taken
in the arrangement, it may be made a very attractive dish.

To the dressing of salads one must give utmost care and attention, as
upon their excellence the success of the dish principally depends.
While rules for dressings are innumerable, there are, after all, only a
few really good ones. The French dressing and the mayonnaise are most
generally known, the former being the simplest and most commonly used
of all dressings. And it is quite the favorite for lettuce, cresses,
chicory, and other vegetable salads. As the salad wilts if allowed to
stand in the dressing, it should not be added till just at the moment
of serving, and it is for this reason that it is frequently made at the
table.

One of the most difficult things to prepare is a perfect mayonnaise,
but once the knack is acquired, failure afterwards is rare. One
essential point is to have all the materials cold. Chill in the
refrigerator both the bowl and oil an hour or more before using. In
warm weather it is advisable during the mixing to stand the bowl in
a larger one of cracked ice. This dressing, if covered closely, will
keep several days or longer in the ice-box. Keep in a cold place till
wanted, as it liquefies as soon as mixed with meat or vegetables. To
tone down the taste of the oil, and thus make more delicate salads, one
may add to the dressing, just before it is used, a little cream beaten
stiff and dry. This dressing is used with nut and fruit salads, and
may be used with potatoes, tomatoes, celery, and other vegetables.

Most cooked vegetables intended for salads are moistened with a French
dressing and allowed to stand an hour or more, or until well seasoned,
in a cold place. To this process the term marinate is applied. Just
before serving, pour off all the marinate that is not absorbed, and
combine with the mayonnaise. A mistake frequently made in preparing
salad dressing is that of using too much acid. The acid flavor should
not predominate, but other flavors should also have their value.


VEGETARIAN CHICKEN SALAD

    Chopped protose, ½ pound.
    Chopped celery, ⅔ cup.
    Grated onion, 1 small teaspoonful.
    Chopped nuttolene, ¼ pound.

fine. Mix with salad dressing and serve on lettuce.


NORMANDIE SALAD

    Walnut meats, 1 cup.
    French peas, 1 can.
    Mayonnaise.
    Lettuce.

Place walnut meats in scalding water about fifteen minutes, then remove
the skins, and cut into pieces about size of a pea. Scald the French
peas, and set aside for a while. Drain the water off the peas, and let
them get cold; then mix with the walnuts. Pour mayonnaise dressing over
all, and mix thoroughly. Serve on lettuce.


BRAZILIAN SALAD

    Ripe strawberries, 1½ cups.
    Fresh pineapple, cut in small cubes, 1½ cups.
    Brazil nuts, blanched and thinly sliced, 12.

Pit the cherries, keeping them as whole as possible. Put a layer of
fruit in the salad bowl, then a layer of sugar, then another layer of
fruit, and so on, till all the fruit is used, finishing with a layer of
sugar. Pour over all one-half cup of lemon juice. Shake the bowl gently
from side to side, to draw out the juice until it nearly covers the
fruit.

More sugar may be used if needed. This salad should be made two hours
before using, and kept on ice.


FRUIT SALAD

    Apples, cut in half-inch cubes, 1 cup.

    Mayonnaise dressing.

Mix apples, celery, and lemon juice well together, and pour mayonnaise
dressing over. Serve on lettuce.

In making Waldorf salad use only crisp, white, tart apples, and the
tender, white heart of the celery. The celery should be cut a little
smaller than the apples. Use only white mayonnaise.

Drain off the lemon juice before adding the dressing, or it will ruin
the mayonnaise.

    Mayonnaise dressing
    Eggs, hard-boiled, 8.

Cut crisp lettuce leaves into pointed strips, like the outer leaves of
a water lily. Cut the whites of hard-boiled eggs also into strips, to
make the petals. Mash all but two or three of the yolks, mix them with
the mayonnaise, and fill in the center of the white petals. Take the
remaining yolks and put through a fine sieve, and scatter this over the
yellow center and white petals to resemble pollen of the flower.

retaining only the solid, fleshy portion. Chop this fine; press through
a sieve and drain.

Mash very fine the hard-boiled yolks of the eggs, and add the raw
yolk. When thoroughly mixed, add the oil, a few drops at a time. When
thick and smooth, add the dry pulp of the tomato, a little at a time.
Stir in the onion juice. Serve on sliced protose or nuttolene.

Boil the beets whole till tender, selecting those of uniform size. Cut
a slice off the bottom, so that they will stand upright, and scoop the
inside out carefully. Take pains not only to avoid breaking the shell,
but to keep the inside as nearly whole as possible. Peel the shells,
and let them get perfectly cold. Cut the centers into tiny cubes, using
an equal amount of parboiled potatoes and white celery cut to same
size; mix well with mayonnaise or French dressing, and fill the shells,

_SALAD DRESSINGS_


MAYONNAISE DRESSING

    Egg yolk, 1.
    Cooking or olive oil.
    Lemon juice.
    Salt.
    Sugar, 1 tablespoonful.

Into a saucer break the yolk of a fresh egg; add to it a large pinch
of salt, and with a fork stir the yolk till it begins to stiffen.
Gradually add to the yolk, a drop at a time, cooking oil or olive oil,
stirring well after each drop is added. Continue this process till the
mixture becomes too stiff to stir, then thin it with lemon juice, and
add more salt. The salt helps to stiffen it. Thicken again with oil in
the same manner as before, and thin again with lemon juice. Continue
this till the desired amount is made. When stiff enough to cut with a
knife, add one tablespoonful of sugar.

This will keep for a number of days, if set on ice. Success in making
this depends upon the care with which the oil is added; at first, a
drop at a time, and towards the last adding two or three drops, and
perhaps half a teaspoonful at a time.

Note.--To make it keep well, add one tablespoonful boiling water,
beaten in quickly. To keep from curdling, put lemon juice and oil on
ice for fifteen minutes before using.


WHITE DRESSING

    Egg yolk, 1, light colored.
    Salt.
    Cracked ice.
    Cream, whipped to stiff froth, 6 tablespoonfuls.
    Oil, 6 tablespoonfuls.
    Lemon juice, 1 tablespoonful.

Drop the yolk into a cold bowl, mix lightly, add a small pinch of salt;
then add the oil drop by drop. The dressing should be very thick. Stand
the bowl in another containing a little cracked ice, so that you may
be constantly reducing the color of the egg. Now add slowly the lemon
juice, then stir in the whipped cream. This dressing, if properly made,
should be almost as white as whipped cream, while having the flavor of
mayonnaise. Serve with Waldorf salad.


BOILED SALAD DRESSING

    Eggs, 5.
    Melted butter, ¼ cup.
    Lemon juice, 4 tablespoonfuls.
    Salt, 1 level teaspoonful.
    Sugar, 1 level teaspoonful.
    Rich cream, 1 cup.

To the yolks add the salt and sugar; beat with an egg whisk until
thick and light, then add gradually the melted butter and lemon juice.
Cook over hot water until the mixture thickens and falls away from the
sides of the pan. Take from stove, put into a glass jar, and when cool
cover closely. When ready to use pour into it lightly the rich cream
whipped to a stiff, dry froth. If whipped cream can not conveniently be
obtained, plain sweet or sour cream may be used in the dressing, but it
will not be so light and flaky.


CREAM SALAD DRESSING (PLAIN)

    Lemon juice, ½ cup.
    Sugar, 1 tablespoonful.
    Rich milk or cream, ½ cup.
    Olive oil, 1 tablespoonful.
    Salt, 1 teaspoonful.
    Eggs well beaten, 2.

Put the lemon juice into a granite dish on the stove, and add the olive
oil, sugar, and salt. Put the milk or cream on the stove in another
saucepan, and when hot add the beaten eggs. Let cook smooth, but do
not allow it to boil or it will curdle. Remove from the stove, and
when partially cool beat the two sauces together. This is a very nice
dressing for vegetable salads.


CREAM SALAD DRESSING

    Cream, 1 cup.
    Milk, cold.
    Butter, size of walnut.
    Salt, 1 level teaspoonful.
    Lemon juice, 4 tablespoonfuls.
    Corn starch, 1 rounded teaspoonful.
    Eggs, 2.
    Sugar, 1 level teaspoonful.

Put the cream into a double boiler; when scalding hot add the corn
starch dissolved in a little cold milk, and cook about five minutes,
stirring constantly. Then add the butter. To the yolks of the eggs add
the salt and sugar; beat till light and thick, then add alternately
the lemon juice and the hot cooked mixture. Fold in the stiffly beaten
whites, and set aside to become cold.

This dressing may be used the same as mayonnaise.


WHITE CREAM SALAD DRESSING

Make same as cream salad dressing, omitting the yolks of the eggs.


FRENCH SALAD DRESSING

    Oil, 3 tablespoonfuls.
    Salt.
    Lemon juice, 1 tablespoonful.
    Onion juice, ¼ teaspoonful.

Mix and pour over the salad.


LETTUCE DRESSING

    Hard-boiled eggs, 3.
    Lemon juice, ½ cup.
    Lettuce.
    Olive oil, 1 tablespoonful.
    Salt.

Mash the yolks smooth and fine, add the olive oil and salt. Mix well,
and add gradually the lemon juice. Beat thoroughly, then pour the
dressing over the lettuce. Cut the whites of the eggs into rings and
lay on top. Serve as soon as dressed.


GOLDEN SALAD DRESSING

    Pineapple juice, ¼ cup.
    Lemon juice, ¼ cup.
    Beaten eggs, 2.
    Sugar, ⅓ cup.

After beating the eggs well, add the pineapple juice, lemon juice,
sugar, and small pinch of salt. Beat together and cook in double
boiler. Let boil about two minutes.


NUT OR OLIVE OIL SALAD DRESSING

    Olive oil, ½ cup.
    Water, ¼ cup.
    Lemon juice, ¼ cup.
    Salt, 1 teaspoonful.
    Beaten eggs, 3.

Beat all well together in the dish; set dish in hot water over the
fire, and stir constantly till thickened. As soon as it begins to
thicken remove from the fire and place in a dish of cold water,
stirring until it cools, and set on ice till cold. It is then ready for
use.


OIL SALAD DRESSING (SOUR)

    Lemon juice, 2 teaspoonfuls.
    Olive oil, ¼ cup.
    Salt, ½ teaspoonful.
    Water, 2 teaspoonfuls.
    Eggs, 2.

Heat together in double boiler, stirring constantly. When it begins to

_SOUPS_


SOUPS

Cream soups are seasonable at any time, using any vegetable in its
season. Canned goods may be used when the fresh article is not
obtainable.

Vegetables that are too tough and old to cook in any other way may be
used in soups to advantage. If it can be afforded, a teaspoonful of
whipped cream may be dropped into each plate, and will be found very
delicious.

By a puree is meant a thick soup; it differs but little from cream
soup, being perhaps a trifle thicker. If properly made, cream soups and
purees are dainty, delicious, and nourishing.

Fruit soups are in favor during hot weather, for dinners and luncheons;
they are very easily made, and are wholesome and refreshing. Any
desired fruit juice may be thickened with corn starch, sago, or
arrowroot, and served with or without fruit.

Fruit soup should always be served cold, in glass sherbet cups, with a
layer of chipped ice on top.


KINDS OF SOUP

Observing these proportions and following the foregoing directions,
delicious cream soups are made of rice, squash, celery, peas,
asparagus, cucumber, spinach, peanuts, potato, corn, lima beans,
cauliflower, beets, tomato, salsify, chestnut, mushrooms, onions,
baked beans, lentils, macaroni, spaghetti, watercress, string beans,
sago, tapioca, barley, carrots, etc. All vegetables should be cooked
very tender in boiling salted water, drained, and rubbed through a
sieve. Rice, sago, tapioca, and barley should be boiled slowly till
each grain is soft and distinct. Roasted peanuts are chopped fine;
chestnuts are boiled and mashed; macaroni and spaghetti are cut into
very small pieces, after boiling till tender. String beans are to be
minced before adding to the soup.


CREAM SOUPS, FOUNDATION OF

cream; melt in a saucepan over the fire, and add slowly four cups milk,

    Salt, 1 teaspoonful.

Take out the inside of the tomatoes and mix with this the bread crumbs.
Then add the other ingredients, and fill the tomatoes, piling mixture
up on top. Place small piece of butter on each, and bake in a hot oven,
until the tomatoes are cooked. When nearly done, sprinkle chopped
parsley over the top.




_VEGETABLES_


VEGETABLES

The term "vegetable," as here used, is applied to such plants (grains,
nuts, and fruits excepted) as are cultivated and used for food. The use
of a large variety of vegetables in our food assists in promoting good
health. To get the best results, they should be judiciously combined
with nuts, fruits, and grains. Green vegetables are rich in potash
salts and other minerals necessary to the system, and in such a form as
to be easily assimilated.

Starchy vegetables, as potatoes, supply energy and heat, and give
necessary bulk to the food. Peas, beans, and lentils contain a large
amount of proteid, used in building and repairing tissue, and are
therefore used in place of meat. For weak stomachs they are more easily
digested in the form of purees and soups, with the outer indigestible
covering removed. All vegetables should be fresh; for in spite of
all that may be said to the contrary, all vegetables, whether roots,
leaves, or any other kind, begin to lose bulk and flavor as soon, as
removed from the ground. The kind that suffer least in this respect are
beets, potatoes, carrots, etc. Those which are most easily affected are
cabbage, lettuce, celery, asparagus, etc.

Vegetables that have been touched with the frost should be kept in
a perfectly dark place for some days. The frost is then drawn out
slowly, and the vegetables are not so liable to rot.


GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR VEGETABLES

Fresh green vegetables should be cooked as soon after being gathered as
possible. Those containing sugar, as corn and peas, lose some of their
sweetness by standing. Wash thoroughly in cold water, but unless wilted
do not soak. It is better not to prepare fresh green vegetables until
they are needed; but if they must be prepared some time before cooking,
cover with cold water.

Most vegetables should be put into fresh, rapidly-boiling water, and if
cooked in uncovered vessels, they will retain a better color, as high
heat destroys their color. In no instance permit them to steep in the
warm water, as this toughens them, and in some instances destroys both
color and flavor.

The salt hardens the water, and also sets the color in the vegetable.
For peas and beans do not add salt to the water until they are nearly
done, as they do not boil tender so readily in hard water.

Corn should not be boiled in salt water, as the salt hardens the outer
covering of skin and makes it tough. Cook the vegetables rapidly till
perfectly tender, but no longer. If vegetables are cooked too long,
flavor, color, and appearance are all impaired. To judge when done,
watch carefully, and test by piercing with a fork. The time required
to cook a vegetable varies with its age and freshness; therefore, the
time tables given for cooking serve only as approximate guides.

Delicate vegetables, as green peas, shelled beans, celery, etc., should
be cooked in as little water as possible, toward the last the water
being allowed to boil away till there is just enough left to moisten.
In this manner all the desirable soluble matter that may have been
drawn out in cooking is saved.

Strongly flavored vegetables, as cabbage, onions, etc., should be
cooked in a generous quantity of water, and the water in which onions
are cooked may be changed one or more times.

The general rule for seasoning vegetables is as follows:--

To two cups small whole vegetables, or two cups of vegetables
mashed or sliced, add a rounding teaspoonful of butter, and half a
level teaspoonful of salt. To beans, peas, and squash, add one-half
teaspoonful of sugar to improve them. Add milk or the vegetable liquid
when additional moisture is required.


POTATOES

Pre-eminent among vegetables stands the potato.

The solid matter of potatoes consists largely of starch, with a small
quantity of albumen and mineral salts. Potatoes also contain an acid
juice, the greater portion of which lies near the skin. This bitter
principle is set free by heat. While potatoes are being boiled, it
passes into the water; in baking it escapes with the steam.

New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit, as the starch grains are
not fully matured. Potatoes are at their best in the fall, and they
keep well during the winter. In the spring, when germination commences,
the starch changes to dextrin or gum, rendering the potato more waxy
when cooked, and the sugar then formed makes them sweeter. When the
potatoes are frozen, the same change takes place.

In the spring, when potatoes are shriveled and gummy, soaking improves
them, as the water thus absorbed dissolves the gum, and makes them less
sticky. At other times, long soaking is undesirable.

Soak about half an hour in the fall, one to three hours in winter and
spring. Never serve potatoes, whether boiled or baked, in a closely
covered dish, as they thus become sodden and clammy; but cover with a
folded napkin, and allow the moisture to escape. They require about
forty-five minutes to one hour to bake, if of a good size, and should
be served promptly when done.


BAKED POTATOES

Potatoes are either baked in their jackets or peeled; in either case
they should not be exposed to a fierce heat, inasmuch as thereby a
great deal of the vegetable is scorched and rendered uneatable. They
should be frequently turned while being baked, and kept from touching
one another in the oven or dish. When they are pared, they should be
baked in a dish, and oil of some kind added, to prevent their outsides
from becoming burned.


MASHED POTATOES

Pare and boil or steam six or eight large potatoes. If boiled, drain
when tender, and let set in the kettle for a few minutes, keeping them
covered, shaking the kettle occasionally to prevent scorching. Mash
with a wire potato masher, or, if convenient, press through a colander;
add salt, a lump of butter, and sufficient hot milk to moisten
thoroughly. Whip with the batter whip, or wooden spoon, until light and
fluffy. Heap up on a plate, press a lump of butter into the top, and
send to the table hot.


POTATO PUFFS

    Potatoes, prepared as for mashed potatoes, 2 cups.
    Cream or milk, ¾ cup.
    Melted butter, 2 tablespoonfuls.

cut into three-quarter-inch dice or irregular pieces. Put in a shallow
baking-pan, sprinkle with salt, pour over sufficient cooking oil,
season well, and prevent scorching. Put into the oven, and when they
begin to brown, stir continually till all are nicely browned.


NEW POTATOES AND CREAM

    New potatoes.
    Cream.
    Salt.
    Butter.
    Parsley.

Wash and rub new potatoes with a coarse cloth or scrubbing brush; drop
into boiling water and boil briskly till done, but no more. Press the
potato against the side of the kettle with a fork; if done, it will
yield to gentle pressure. In a saucepan have ready some butter and
cream, hot but not boiling, a little green parsley, and salt. Drain
the potatoes, add the mixture, put over hot water a minute or two, and
serve.

STEWED SALSIFY OR VEGETABLE OYSTERS

    Salsify, cut in ¼-inch slices, 1 quart.
    Milk, 2 cups.
    Butter, 1 tablespoonful.
    Salt to taste.

Wash and scrape the salsify, slice, and put into cold water to prevent
discoloring. Cook in sufficient boiling water to cover. When tender,
drain, add the milk and butter, let simmer a few minutes, and serve.


ESCALLOPED VEGETABLE OYSTER

    Sliced vegetable oyster, 3 cups.
    Rich cream sauce.
    Sifted bread crumbs.
    Salt.

Wash, scrape, cut in thin slices, and put into plenty of cold water
till ready to use, to prevent discoloration. When ready to cook, boil
in enough water to prevent scorching. Salt when they begin to get
tender. Boil a few minutes longer, but do not let them get too salty.
Drain, or remove with a skimmer, putting a layer in a baking-pan, then
a little rich cream sauce, then another layer of each. Sprinkle the top
with sifted bread crumbs, and bake a light brown.


MOCK OYSTERS

    Corn, young and tender, 6 ears.
    Flour, 3 tablespoonfuls.
    Butter, 3 tablespoonfuls.
    Eggs, 3.
    Oil.
    Salt, 3 teaspoonfuls.

Grate the corn with a coarse grater into a deep dish; beat the whites
and yolks separately, and add the corn, flour, butter, and salt. Drop
spoonfuls of this batter into a frying-pan with hot oil, and fry a
light brown on both sides. The corn must be young.


CELERY

Cut off all the roots and remove all the decayed and outside leaves.
Wash thoroughly, being careful to remove all specks and blemishes. If
the stalks are large, divide them lengthwise into two or three pieces
and place root downward in a celery glass, which should be nearly
filled with cold water.


STEWED CELERY

    Celery hearts, 6.
    White sauce, 2 cups.

Cut the celery into half-inch lengths and cook in boiling, salted
water. When tender, drain and pour over this the sauce. Heat well, and
serve. The liquid drained from the celery may be thickened, seasoned
with a little butter, and used instead of the white sauce if preferred.


LENTILS (ORIENTAL STYLE)

Wash the lentils well, soak overnight, and drain. Cook in boiling water
till tender; drain again. Put the olive oil in a saucepan, add the
onion, and cook till the onion is soft, not brown. Add the lentils and
boiled rice, mix, stir over the fire till hot, add the salt, and serve
hot.


LENTILS WITH ONIONS

    Lentils, 1 cup.
    Onions, 2.
    Butter.

Wash the lentils, put to cook in saucepan with plenty of cold water,
and boil till tender; when soft, turn them into a fine colander, and
drain thoroughly, saving the water they were cooked in. Peel the
onions, cut into thin slices, put in a flat stew-pan with a lump of
butter, or a little olive oil, and fry. Put the lentils in the onions
and add salt to taste. Moisten with a little of the broth drained from
the lentils and allow them to simmer at the side of the fire. Serve.


CREAMED CHESTNUTS

Boil or steam the chestnuts till tender. Make a cream sauce of milk or
cream, seasoned with butter, and slightly thickened with flour. Pour
this over the chestnuts; serve as a vegetable.


ASPARAGUS NO. 1

Asparagus, like potatoes, contains a bitter alkaloid, which is drawn
into the water in cooking, and often imparts to it a very unpleasant
flavor. This may be remedied by blanching the asparagus in boiling
water for four or five minutes. Then drain, and add more hot water, and
finish cooking.


ASPARAGUS NO. 2

Scrape the stalk ends of the asparagus or break off the tough lower
stalks as far as they will snap. Wash well, tie in bundles, and put
into enough rapidly-boiling salted water to cover. Allow a teaspoonful
of salt to each quart of water; cook uncovered from twenty to thirty
minutes, or till perfectly tender. Drain, remove the string, spread
with salt and butter, and serve immediately on toast. The asparagus may
be neatly arranged on hot toast and covered with white cream sauce, if
preferred.


ASPARAGUS POMPADOUR

Wash the asparagus carefully, place in a saucepan of boiling salted
water, and boil till done. Take them out and cut into lengths of about
two inches, and place on a cloth near the fire to dry. Prepare a little
sauce made of lemon juice, butter, yolk of an egg, and salt. Place the
asparagus on a dish, over which pour the sauce, and serve.


PEAS

The flavor of peas and the time required for cooking depend largely
upon their freshness. Very young peas will cook tender in twenty
minutes, older peas sometimes requiring an hour or more. A teaspoonful
of finely minced parsley cooked with peas imparts to them a very
delicious flavor.


STEWED ASPARAGUS

Break the tender parts of the asparagus into one-inch lengths and put
into enough boiling water to cover. Boil till tender; add sufficient
rich milk or cream to make a gravy. Thicken with flour, season with
salt, let come to a boil, and serve.


ASPARAGUS WITH EGGS

    Asparagus.
    Cream, 2 tablespoonfuls.
    Salt.
    Eggs, 4.
    Butter, 1 tablespoonful.

Cut the tender tops from a bunch of asparagus, and boil about twenty
minutes. Then put into a baking-tin with butter and salt. Beat the
whites and yolks of the eggs separately, add the cream and pour this
over the asparagus. Bake until the eggs are set.


ASPARAGUS WITH GREEN PEAS

    Asparagus, 2 cups.
    Peas, 2 cups.
    Salt.
    Rich milk or cream.
    Flour.

Break the tender parts of the asparagus into one-inch lengths and put
with the peas into boiling water enough to cover. Boil till tender;
add sufficient rich milk or cream to make a gravy. Thicken with flour,
season with salt, let come to a boil, and serve.


BAKED BEANS

Wash one and three-fourths cups of navy beans and put them into an
earthen jar, covering immediately with one and three-fourths quarts
of boiling water. Add salt, cover, and put into the oven. When they
boil well, draw the jar to the edge of the oven, where they will just
simmer. Cook for twenty-four hours. If they get too dry, add a little
boiling water. The beans will be nicely colored and have a rich flavor.


BAKED BEANS

    Small white beans, 2 cups.
    Protose, if desired.
    Molasses, 1 teaspoonful.
    Salt.

Clean the beans, soak in cold water one hour, season with salt and
molasses. Put into a covered jar with plenty of water; bake overnight
in a slow oven. When done, the beans should be whole, dry, and mealy,
and of a rich brown color. This can only be obtained by baking the
beans several hours in a slow oven. If desired, a little chopped
protose may be added. Serve the beans plain, or with brown bread.


PUREE OF BEANS

Follow the directions given for puree of peas.


BEANS STEWED

Wash the required quantity of navy, lima, kidney, or other beans, and
put to cook in plenty of boiling water; boil till they are swollen,
then put them where they will stew till cooked; season just before they
finish cooking. Never parboil beans.


BAKED BEANS WITH TOMATO SAUCE

Prepare the beans as for plain baked beans; put into the jars to bake;
cover with a mixture of strained stewed tomatoes and water in equal
proportions; a little butter or olive oil may be added.


SUCCOTASH

    Fresh shelled lima beans, 2 cups.
    Sweet corn, 2 ears.
    Cream, ½ cup.
    Butter, size of an egg.
    Salt.

Put beans in pot with cold water, rather more than will cover them.
Scrape the kernels from twelve ears of young sweet corn. Put the cobs
in with the peas, boiling from thirty to forty-five minutes. Take out
the cobs and put in the scraped corn. Boil again for fifteen minutes;
then season with salt, butter and cream. Serve hot.


ONIONS

Contrary to the opinion of many, the onion is not objectionable as an
article of food. Judiciously used it fills as important a place in
cooking as salt or any other seasoning.


BAKED ONIONS

    Onions, large, 6.
    Salt.
    Crumbs.
    Milk.
    Butter.

Put onions into a saucepan of water, or water and milk mixed in equal
proportions; add salt and boil till tender. When done so that they can
be easily mashed, work them up with a little butter into a paste. Cover
with bread crumbs and bake in a moderate oven.


STUFFED ONIONS

Peel the desired number of onions, being careful not to cut off the
root end. Take out the inside of the onion and fill the hole with a
mixture of bread crumbs, beaten egg, and a little milk. Season with
salt and sage. Bake in oven until brown.


SCRAMBLED TOMATOES

    Tomatoes, 6.
    Eggs, 3.
    Butter.
    Salt.

Remove the skins from six tomatoes and cut them up in a saucepan. Add
a little butter and salt. When sufficiently boiled beat up eggs, and
just before you serve turn them into the saucepan with the tomatoes,
and stir one way for two minutes, allowing them time to get thoroughly
done.


SPINACH

Trim the spinach and wash in three or four waters to remove the grit.
Cook in boiling water about twenty minutes, removing the scum. Do not
cover the vessel while cooking. When tender, turn into a colander,
drain, and press well. Chop fine, put into a saucepan with butter and
salt. Set on the fire and cook till quite dry, stirring it all the
time. Turn into a vegetable dish, shape, and garnish with slices of
hard-boiled eggs.


SUMMER SQUASH

Wash and cut in pieces. Cook in the steamer, that it may be as dry as
possible. When done, let it stand and drain a few minutes, shaking it
occasionally. Mash and season with salt, butter, and a little cream.


WINTER SQUASH (HUBBARD)

_Mashed_:

Cut the squash, pare, remove seeds, wash, and put into the steamer.
Cook until soft, remove and mash or press through a colander. Season
with salt, butter, sugar, and a little sweet cream. Beat well, and
serve.

_Baked_:

Cut into pieces of desired size, remove seeds, sprinkle with a little
sugar and salt; bake until done. Serve in the shell, or it may be
peeled before baking.


PUREE OF PEAS

    Peas, fresh, 2 cups (or dry, 1 cup).
    Butter, 1 tablespoonful.
    Cream or milk, 1½ cups.
    Flour, 1 level tablespoonful.
    Salt, 1 teaspoonful.

Put the peas to cook in boiling water; boil until tender, then simmer
slowly, cooking as dry as possible without scorching. When soft and
dry, rub through a colander to remove the hulls. Put the butter in a
saucepan; when melted stir in the flour, being careful not to scorch;
pour in the milk gradually, stirring all the time; and when thoroughly
cooked, add the salt and the pulp of the peas. Turn all into a double
boiler, heat thoroughly, and serve.


GREEN CORN (STEWED)

    Green corn, 3 cups.
    Butter.
    Salt.
    Milk, more or less, 1 cup.
    Sugar.

Husk and clean as for boiling corn; with a sharp knife cut off the top
of the grain, being careful not to cut too close to the cob and with
the back of the knife press out the remaining pulp. When cut in this
way, the corn is much more juicy than when the grains are cut close to
the cob. Place the milk in a granite saucepan, and when boiling, add
the butter and corn; cook from ten to fifteen minutes, or until it
loses its raw taste. Stir frequently, and season to taste with salt and
sugar.


GREEN CORN (BOILED)

Strip off the husk, remove the silk, put into fresh boiling water, and
cook ten to twenty minutes. Cook only till done, for if boiled too
long, the corn hardens, and its flavor is impaired. If the corn is not
very sweet, add one-fourth cup of sugar to the water in which it is
boiled.


GREEN PEAS (VERY YOUNG AND TENDER)

Shell the peas and cover with cold water; skim off undeveloped peas
which rise to the top of the water and drain. Barely cover with boiling
water; cook till tender, then add salt. When done, very little water
should remain. Season to taste with butter and add more salt if needed.
A little sugar is sometimes an improvement.

When the peas are older, half a cup of milk or cream, with sufficient
flour to thicken, is considered an improvement.


PLAIN BOILED STRING BEANS

Break off the ends of beans and string; wash thoroughly; if large cut
them in two; drop into boiling water and boil till tender. Salt and
season with olive oil or butter; if preferred, drain off the juice,
salt to taste, and add some hot, rich milk.


CAULIFLOWER WITH CREAM SAUCE

Divide the cauliflower into portions of convenient size before cooking.
Boil slowly, or steam till tender, drain, and when dished up, pour one
or two tablespoonfuls of strained white sauce over each portion.

thirty minutes; steam or boil gently till tender; separate into small
sprays and pour over them a sauce made of the milk thickened with flour
and butter beaten together. Add a little salt. Cover lightly with bread
crumbs, which have been moistened with melted butter, and bake until a
nice brown. Serve at once.


CAULIFLOWER WITH TOMATO SAUCE

Prepare as for stewed cauliflower, and when done serve with tomato
sauce.

Sauce:

Prepare as for plain boiled cauliflower; cook or steam till tender;
drain and put in a stew-pan; pour over some rich milk or cream; stew
together for a few minutes, and serve.


BOILED CAULIFLOWER (PLAIN)

Pick off the outside leaves, cut the stalk one inch from the head,
split, wash thoroughly in cold water. Put in salted water for one or
two hours before cooking. Cook in salted, boiling water (milk added to
the water will keep it white). Boil till tender; remove from the fire;
let stand in same water till ready to serve. Drain, serve with cream,
butter, or egg sauce poured over.


BROWNED CAULIFLOWER

Prepare as for plain boiled cauliflower; boil until tender; place in a
baking-dish and sprinkle with fine bread crumbs; pour over some thin
cream sauce, and brown in the oven. Serve with egg or butter sauce.

BRUSSELS SPROUTS BAKED WITH CRUMBS

Prepare as for plain boiled; when done, drain, and press dry; arrange
in a baking-dish and sprinkle with bread crumbs; pour over a thin cream
or egg sauce. Bake in the oven till nicely browned.


BEETS

Select young red beets; cut off the tops half an inch from the root.
If cut too close, the roots will bleed and the color will be impaired.
Wash and clean carefully with the brush to remove all particles of
dirt. They may be boiled or steamed. If boiled, use as little water as
possible. Young beets will cook in an hour; old beets require three or
four hours, according to age and size. When done, put in cold water,
rub off the skins, and they are ready for use.


BEET GREENS

Wash young, tender beet tops, cleaning thoroughly; drain and boil in
salted water till tender; drain, chop fine, season with butter or oil,
and serve with lemon juice or cream.


BEET STALKS WITH BUTTER SAUCE

Chop beets and potatoes fine and season with salt and butter. Pour
over a little cream. Put on the stove in a covered saucepan, and stir
occasionally. When thoroughly heated through, serve.


BAKED PARSNIPS

Scrape and cut in half lengthwise; boil till tender; put in a shallow
baking-pan; put a few pieces of chopped butter or a little cooking oil
on top; sprinkle lightly with sugar; pour over sufficient cream to
about half cover. Salt to taste and bake a rich brown.


PARSNIPS IN EGG SAUCE

Clean and cut into small dice and boil in a little salted water until
tender, drain and pour over sufficient egg sauce to cover.


STEWED PARSNIPS

After washing the parsnips, slice them about half an inch thick; put
them in a saucepan containing enough boiling water to barely cook
them; add a tablespoonful of butter, season with salt, then cover
closely and stew them until the water has cooked away, stirring often
to prevent burning, until they are soft. When they are done, they will
be of a creamy, light straw color, and deliciously sweet, retaining all
the nutrition of the vegetable.


YOUNG TURNIPS

Cut into half-inch dice and boil till tender; drain and add a small
lump of butter and a little salt; heat well and add a dash of lemon
juice at the last.


MASHED TURNIPS

Turnips may be cooked and mashed the same as potatoes, keeping them
as dry as possible. The addition of a little sugar is considered an
improvement by some.

    Egg, 1.
    Butter, ½ cup.
    Lemon, large, 1.

burning; drain and set in a covered dish on the side of the range,
where they will keep hot but not burn. Melt the butter, add the beaten
yolk with the eggs, juice of the lemon, and a little salt. Serve a
spoonful of this sauce over each order of turnip.


FRENCH CARROTS

Scrape enough small round carrots to make three cups; boil in salted
water till tender; drain, and cover with a rich parsley sauce.


CARROTS A LA CREME

Clean carrots, cut in slices about half an inch thick, and parboil in
salted water. Drain, pour over some hot rich milk, and let simmer till
done. Add a little butter; season with salt.


CARROTS WITH EGG SAUCE

Clean carrots, cut in slices about half an inch thick, and boil until
tender; drain, pour egg sauce over, and serve.


PUREE OF CARROTS

Clean young carrots, cut into slices, and boil in salted water until
tender. Drain, mash through a colander, and season with a little salt
and cream. Serve as mashed potatoes, or with broiled or braized protose
as an entree.


TO DRESS CUCUMBERS

Pare and lay in cold water--ice water if possible--for an hour. Slice
very thin. Sprinkle a very little fine salt over each piece. Let stand
for an hour. Shake the dish briskly, drain closely, sprinkle with lemon
juice, and serve.

Boil the vegetables till tender, chop fine, then beat with the eggs and
proceed as with plain omelets.


OMELET SOUFFLE NO. 1

Take two eggs, separate whites from yolks, beat whites very stiff,
salt, and add yolks, beating just enough to mix yolks with whites. Turn
into a hot oiled omelet pan, put in medium hot oven, and bake till
done, or to a rich brown. Serve in great haste on being removed from
the oven, to prevent falling.


OMELET SOUFFLE NO. 2

    Eggs, 4.
    Powdered sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls.
    Flavoring.

Beat the yolks of the eggs as light as possible, and add the sugar,
a few drops of flavoring, and beat to a cream. Beat the whites until
you can turn the plate bottom side up, without their falling. Pour the
beaten whites and yolks together and mix thoroughly. Put into an oiled
baking dish, and dust with powdered sugar. Bake in a moderate oven till
a golden brown. Serve at once.

A very delicate souffle is made of whites of eggs beaten stiff, adding
a tablespoonful of sugar to two whites, and chopped apricots or
peaches. Any kind of marmalade may be used in place of fruit.


PLAIN OMELET (FRENCH)

Break eggs into a dish, whip lightly with egg whip or fork, turn into
hot oiled skillet, and place on range. As soon as they begin to set,
lift edges of omelet, so that the uncoagulated part can run under, next
to bottom of the skillet. When light brown, turn, and cook till light
brown on the other side. Fold with knife about one-third over; then
toss out on hot platter, so that the one-third fold will be underneath.
Garnish with parsley and watercress. Serve at once.


PROTOSE OMELET

    Protose, ½ a thin slice.
    Eggs, 2.
    Minced parsley.
    Cooking oil.

Mince the protose fine, break two eggs, separating the whites, beat the
yolks a little, and stir the minced protose into them. Beat the whites
into a froth, not stiff, and stir into the protose; add a little minced
parsley; put a little oil into the omelet pan, and when hot pour in
the mixture. Cook a few minutes. Insert a knife between the omelet and
pan, and with a sudden turn of the hand fold the omelet in two. Finish
cooking in hot oven two or three seconds. Serve hot.


GLUTEN OMELET

Same as plain omelet, adding one tablespoonful of gluten to eggs and
cream before whipping. Serve at once on a hot platter.


RICE OMELET

Same as plain omelet, only adding one tablespoonful of cooked rice to
eggs and milk before beating. Serve on a hot platter at once.


APPLE OMELET

Same as plain omelet. Serve with a tablespoonful of well seasoned
apple sauce, mixed with equal amount of beaten white of egg on side of

tablespoonful of rich cream over them, salt, set in oven, and bake as
desired. Serve at once.


FLOATED EGGS

Take two fresh eggs, separate whites from yolks, put yolks into a
soup bowl of hot water, being careful not to break them. Let set two
minutes, then place them, bowl and all, into a larger dish of boiling
water, and cook till set as desired,--two minutes for medium, four
minutes for hard. Meantime beat whites very stiff, mold them in a soup
bowl, then float mold on boiling water two or three minutes till nicely
set. Then place them on large platter, place yolk in center, garnish
with parsley, and serve. In removing whites from bowl, take bowl in
left hand, knife in right, dip bowl about one-third in water, then slip
knife under edge of mold in the water. The water will get under eggs
and float them out easily. This makes a nice dish for the sick, if
yolks be boiled hard and whites are cooked rare.


BAKED EGGS IN TOMATO CASES

_BEVERAGES_


CARAMEL-CEREAL

(A Substitute for Coffee)

For each cup of the beverage required use two tablespoonfuls of the
cereal and boil for ten to twenty minutes. Then remove to the side of
the range and let steep a few minutes. The strength and aroma of cereal
coffee are developed by long steeping.


CHOCOLATE

Grate some Sanitas chocolate, place in a saucepan, and to each two
ounces allow one cup of cold water. Let it stand until the chocolate
is soft, place over the fire, and when it boils, cook one minute. Work
it briskly with an egg beater, then serve at once, adding at the last
moment a tablespoonful of whipped cream to each cup.

It is considered an improvement by some to use two-thirds chocolate and
one-third malted nuts.

Other chocolate is not recommended, as it contains an injurious
alkaloid, which in the Sanitas brand is removed by a special process.


FRUIT NECTAR

For every eight parts of fruit juice used add one part of lemon juice
and sweeten to taste. A combination of fruit juices, as grape, cherry,
and raspberry, makes a very nice nectar, always using the lemon juice.

the juices and add the rest of the sugar and the water. Stir till the
sugar is dissolved, then strain through a coarse cloth, and serve with
crushed ice.


LEMONADE NO. 1

The best lemonade is made from lemon syrup. Into the juice of twelve
lemons grate the rind of six. Be careful to exclude all seeds and the
inner white skin, as they impart a bitter taste. Let stand overnight.
Make thick syrup of white sugar, and when cold strain the lemon juice
into it. A tablespoonful added to a glass of water makes a perfect
lemonade.

and freshly-grated pineapple. Let this cool, then strain carefully, and
add ice-water, about four cups.




_CEREALS_


CEREALS

Grains may be considered perfect food in themselves, as they contain
all the food elements in nearly right proportions. Rice is an exception
to this, the starch being in excess.

In cooking grains in the form of porridges, they should be introduced
into rapidly salted water, beating with a batter whisk so that the
grains may be thoroughly mixed with the water and be free from lumps.
In cooking coarse grains, as cracked wheat, pearl barley, hominy, etc.,
keep them boiling, stirring occasionally until the grain does not sink
to the bottom, but hangs suspended in the water. If the inner part of a
double boiler has been used, it may now be set into the outer boiler,
which should be placed on the range where the water will boil rapidly.
Replenish the water in the outside boiler from time to time with
boiling water.

By setting the grain in boiling water, the indigestible outer portion
or cellulose is more completely broken up, and the starch granules
are more thoroughly acted upon by the water, the object being to cook
the starch and the gluten as thoroughly as possible. If the grains
are cooked in a double boiler, they will not need to be stirred after
they are set, except when cooked in a very large quantity. The cooking
should be continuous and the length of time varies according to the
varying proportion of gluten in the grain. The larger percentage of
starch, the shorter the time required in cooking. Grains combine nicely
with fruits, and may be cooked or served with either fruit or fruit
juices.


OATMEAL

    Oatmeal, 1 cup.
    Water, 1 quart.

Put water into a double boiler, place on the range, and when boiling
add oatmeal. Boil until it thickens and finish in double boiler. Cook
five hours.


ROLLED OATS

    Rolled oats, 1½ cups.
    Water, 1 quart.

Put water into a double boiler, place on the range, and when boiling
add rolled oats. Boil until it thickens and finish in double boiler.
Cook four hours.


CRACKED WHEAT

    Water, 4 cups.
    Salt, 1 teaspoonful.
    Cracked wheat, 1 cup.

Put water into the inner double boiler, place on the range, and when
boiling add salt and cracked wheat. Boil rapidly until grains do not
sink when the dish is lifted from the range. Place in the outer boiler
and cook constantly for four or five hours.


PEARL WHEAT

    Water, 4 cups.
    Pearl wheat, washed, 1 cup.
    Salt.

Boil water in the inner double boiler, add pearl wheat, and salt. Place
in the outer boiler and cook five or six hours.


PEARL BARLEY

    Pearl barley, well washed, 1 cup.
    Water, 4 cups.

Put cold water into double boiler and add pearl barley. Heat slowly and
cook about six hours.


FARINA

    Milk, or water, 6 cups.
    Farina, 1 cup.
    Salt.

Put the milk or water in the inner part of a double boiler, place on
the range, and when boiling add salt and farina. Let it boil for two or
three minutes, stirring all the time. Then place in a double boiler and
cook one hour. If milk is used, it should first be simmered or scalded
in a double boiler, and then placed on the range and the milk will
boil almost immediately. In this way the milk will not be so liable to
scorch as if it was put on the range at first. This rule will apply to
all grains cooked with milk.


RICE (SOUTHERN STYLE)

    Rice, 1 cup.
    Salt, 1 teaspoonful.
    Water, 6 Cups.

scant cupful. Cover the vessel and let steam fifteen minutes or more,
stirring once or twice. Serve with butter or gravy, the latter being
stirred in quickly while the rice is hot.


RICE (WESTERN STYLE)

    Rice, 1 cup.
    Water, 6 cups.
    Salt, 1 tablespoonful.

Wash rice, put in kettle of water, salt, and boil till tender, stirring
once or twice to prevent sticking. Drain off all water through a
colander and pour over hot water sufficient to wash off the starchy
water and separate the grains. Leave in the colander and set into
another pan, so that the bottom of colander will not touch. Cover and
place in the oven a few minutes.


RICE WITH RAISINS

    Washed rice, 1 cup.
    Raisins, washed, seeded, ½ cup.
    Salt, ½ teaspoonful.
    Water, 2 cups.

Put in an enameled pan, cover, and steam one hour.

    Mixed gluten and granola, 1½ pints.

Cook fifteen minutes, and serve with cream.




_TOASTS_


TOASTS

Toasts are uniformly and properly regarded as a breakfast dish, and
when properly prepared are wholesome, nutritious, and appetizing, and
far more conducive to health than the fried mushes and griddle cakes
with which so many are prone to appease their appetites.

Zwieback should be used as the foundation of all toasts, although
ordinary toasted bread can be used. In toasting bread, do not expose
it to such fierce heat that the bread will be burned or singed. Singed
bread is not toasted bread. Again, the fire should be hot enough to
more than simply dry the bread. It should be toasted as far through as
possible, and should be crisp and brittle, not hard. In using zwieback
for toast it may be moistened by hot milk, if for cream, gravy, or egg
toast; or with hot salted water, if for fruit. In either case the toast
should be dipped quickly in and out again so as not to absorb too much
liquid and become mushy. Under this head a few kinds of toasts will be
given, inexpensive and otherwise. While it is not an exhaustive list,
it will include sufficient to suggest others equally good.


MILK TOAST

    Milk, 6 cups.
    Flour, 1 heaped teaspoonful.
    Butter, 1 tablespoonful.
    Toasted bread or zwieback.

Heat milk and butter in a saucepan over the fire; when boiling, add
salt and flour, moistened with a little milk. Let it boil, remove from
the fire, and dip into this slices of toasted bread or zwieback. Pour
what remains over the toast, cover, and send to the table hot.


CREAM TOAST

    Cream, 6 cups.
    Zwieback.
    Milk.

Heat cream to boiling, dip slices of zwieback into hot milk for an
instant, place on saucer, pour hot cream over, and serve.


AMERICAN OR FRENCH TOAST

    Eggs, thoroughly beaten, 3.
    Salt.
    Butter.
    Milk, 3 cups.
    Sliced bread.

Beat the eggs thoroughly and add the milk and a little salt. Slice
light bread and dip into the mixture, allowing each slice to absorb
some of the milk. Then brown on a hot, buttered griddle or thick
bottomed frying-pan. Spread with butter, and serve hot.


BOSTON CREAM TOAST

Toast two slices of bread, trim and cut in two lengthwise, making
four pieces. Place these evenly on top of one another and cut again
cornerwise, into long triangular pieces. Arrange artistically on a
platter, and serve with cream sauce.


NUN'S TOAST

    Hard-boiled eggs, 6.
    Flour, 1 teaspoonful.
    Butter.
    Hot buttered toast.
    Finely-chopped onion, 1.
    Milk, 2 cups.

Put the butter into a saucepan, and when it begins to bubble add the
chopped onion. Let the onion cook a little without color, then stir in
the flour. Add the milk and stir till it becomes smooth. Then put in
the eggs which have been sliced and let them get hot. Pour this mixture
over neatly trimmed slices of hot, buttered toast. Season with salt.


NUT GRAVY TOAST

Dress moistened toast with nut gravy as given under sauces.


PRUNE WHIPPED TOAST

    Prune pulp, 2 cups.
    Sugar, 1 tablespoonful.
    Eggs, whites, 4.

Beat the whites very stiff and stir in the hot prune pulp and sugar.
Serve on slices of zwieback which have been dipped in hot water.


PRUNE TOAST

Prepare as for apricot toast, using prune marmalade.


DATE TOAST

Prepare as for prune toast, except that the dates should be steamed,
not boiled.


PROTOSE TOAST

    Minced protose, 2 cups.
    Eggs, 2.
    Sweet cream, ½ cup.
    Salt to taste.

Mix and heat thoroughly; when boiling hot spread over slices of

    Toasted bread.

Dipped in hot salt water, and well buttered. Take

    Hard-boiled egg, 1,

Cut in halves, remove yolk, and fill hole with

    Currant jelly,

And place on top of the protose.


NUTTOLENE ON TOAST

Mince half a pound of nuttolene very fine, put in a well-oiled
saucepan, and fry over the fire till a delicate brown. Great care must
be taken to prevent scorching; shake the pan often. Make two cups
of rich cream sauce well seasoned with butter sauce, and desiccated
cocoanut. Strain this over the nuttolene, and serve a spoonful on warm
toast. This makes six large portions.


BERRY TOAST

Any canned fruit, as strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, etc., may
be used for toasts. Strain off the juice, boil, and thicken with corn
starch to the consistency of cream. Stir in the strawberries and reheat
till the berries are well heated through. Serve as other fruit toasts.


BANANA TOAST NO. 1

Peel and rub some nice bananas through a fine colander; sweeten and
beat up with a little cream, and serve on moistened toast. Serve cold.


BANANA TOAST NO. 2

Take the desired quantity of bright fruit juice, as strawberry or
cherry. Boil and thicken with corn starch. Into this slice some ripe
bananas. The juice should not be too thick, but just so that the banana
will appear suspended in the juice. Serve on moistened toast.


DATE TOAST WITH WALNUTS

Prepare same as date toast, then serve with walnut meat on each corner
and one in the center.


TOMATO TOAST

Dress moistened toast with tomato sauce, as given under sauces; or use
strained tomatoes thickened with flour or corn starch.


ASPARAGUS TOAST

Prepare as for stewed asparagus. Moisten and butter a piece of toast,
lay four or five pieces of asparagus on it, pour a spoonful of white
sauce on the bottom end of the stalks, and serve.


APPLE TOAST

Fresh stewed apples, rubbed through a colander and sweetened, make a
nice dressing. The apples may be flavored with lemon, or mixed with
grape or cranberry sauce. When the apples are put in the colander, the
liquid may be poured into a saucepan and boiled into a syrup, and the
toast moistened with this. Serve a spoonful or two of the apple sauce
over all.


APRICOT TOAST

In making apricot marmalade, save the juice by itself and boil it down
into a syrup. Moisten the toast, pour over some of the syrup, and some
of the marmalade over all.




_BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES_


BAKERY AND BREAKFAST DISHES

Thin batters are about the consistency of thin cream. Thick batters are
like cream. Still thicker batters, which may be poured in a continuous
stream, are called pour batters. Any batter is a pour batter until it
is made so stiff that it breaks or drops in the pouring, when it is
called a drop batter. It will remain a batter until too stiff to be
beaten, when it becomes a dough.

Doughs, like batters, are of varying degrees of thickness, ranging from
those just stiff enough to be handled to those which may be rolled thin
as paper. Generally speaking, one full measure of flour to one scant
measure of liquid makes a pour batter. Two full measures of flour make
a drop batter; and three full measures make a dough; although, for
various reasons, these proportions are subject to many modifications.

If the ingredients in batters were simply mixed and cooked slowly,
the resulting substances would be hard and compact, unfit for human
digestion. Hence, to obviate this, and to make them light and porous,
we must resort to other processes. This is accomplished by means of
the expansion of incorporated air, by the generation of gas within the
mixture, or by a combination of both methods, supplemented by quick
cooking before the gas has a chance to escape.

Air at seventy degrees expands to about three times its volume when
exposed to the temperature of a hot oven. Consequently, as a mixture
heats in cooking, incorporated air expands, giving the desired
lightness. Air is incorporated or enclosed in batters by beating the
mixture thoroughly, as in making whole-wheat gems; by adding eggs to
the beaten mixture, as in popovers; and by the gas obtained by the
union of an acid with an alkaline carbonate, as in the use of baking
powders. In batters made light by the admixture of air, one must
exercise care in beating to actually incorporate and retain the air.
When eggs are added to the mixture, the glutinous consistency of the
albumin they contain assists in retaining the entangled air.


GEMS OR PUFFS (PLAIN)

    Milk, 1 cup.
    Salt.
    Cooking oil, 1 tablespoonful, if desired.
    Egg, 1.
    Sifted flour, about 2 cups.

Break the egg into the milk, add salt, and beat thoroughly. Beat into
this enough sifted flour to make a batter that will pile slightly when
poured in a thick stream. Bake in hot greased gem irons in a brisk
oven. A tablespoonful of cooking oil may be added to the milk if a
richer batter is desired.


CORN GEMS

Make same as plain gems, but use one-fourth corn meal and a little
sugar.


WHOLE-WHEAT AND GRAHAM GEMS

Use one-fourth to one-third whole wheat or graham flour.


GRANOSE PUFFS

    Eggs, 4.
    Ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoonful.
    Salt.
    Sugar, ¼ cup.
    Granose flakes, 4 cups.

Beat the yolks of the eggs with the sugar until light, then add the
cinnamon and salt. Beat again, then add two cups granose flakes. Mix
thoroughly and add half of the stiffly-beaten whitest of the eggs, then
two more cups granose flakes, and lastly the rest of the whites. Drop
in round gem irons, filling them heaping full, and bake a light brown.
They may be iced and a little shredded cocoanut sprinkled on top.

To make a thick pour batter. To this add the

    Yolks of 5 eggs.

Beat up thoroughly and add the

    Stiffly-beaten whites.

Bake on soapstone griddle. Be careful not to have the milk scalding
hot, as it renders cakes soft and sticky.


GREEN CORN GRIDDLE CAKES

    Flour, 2 cups.
    Milk, 1¾ cups.
    Butter.
    Salt, ½ level teaspoonful.
    Eggs, 3.

Mix the salt and flour, pour on slowly half the milk to make a smooth
batter; add the eggs, one at a time, beating well, and gradually the
remaining milk. Beat vigorously for a few minutes, then turn at once
into hot well-buttered gem-pans, filling them about half full. Bake in
rather hot oven from twenty to thirty minutes.


CORN BREAD WITHOUT BAKING POWDER NO. 1

    Corn meal, 2 cups.
    Eggs, 4.
    Salt.
    Boiling milk, 3 cups.
    Butter, size of egg.

Put the meal into the mixing bowl, make hollow in the center, put in
butter and salt, and pour the hot milk over all, and stir well. Let
cool, and if too stiff, add a little more cold milk. Break the eggs and
separate them; add the yolks to the meal and beat five minutes. Beat
the whites and add them to the batter. Oil a baking-pan, make it hot,
and turn in the batter. Bake in a quick oven thirty minutes.


HOE CAKE

    Corn meal, 4 cups.
    Water, or milk.
    Melted butter, 1 tablespoonful.
    Salt and sugar as desired.

Sift corn meal with a little salt, and sugar if desired; scald with
sufficient water or milk to make a stiff batter, but soft enough to
spread easily with a knife. A tablespoonful of melted butter may be
added if desired. Spread on a baking-sheet or pan about one-half inch
thick or less and bake slowly till crisp clear through.

If the cake bakes fast on the bottom, it may be turned over so that
both sides may be evenly baked.

    Butter, 1 rounded tablespoonful.
    Mixture, 2 parts corn meal to 1 part flour.
    Eggs, 2.
    Sugar, 3 heaped tablespoonfuls.

Take three cups of the sponge as set for making wheat bread, measured
when light, ready to mix up stiff. Add sugar, eggs, and butter. To this
add a mixture of two-thirds corn meal and one-third flour until it is
as stiff as will stir conveniently (if made too stiff, the bread will
be dry; if not stiff enough, it will be sticky). Put about half an inch
deep in greased pans, and let rise till nearly an inch deep and bake in
a moderate oven. It may be in deeper loaves, but they are not likely to
be so satisfactory.


GEORGIA PONES

    Southern corn meal, 2 cups.
    Sugar, 1 tablespoonful.
    Salt, ½ teaspoonful.
    Boiling milk or cream.

Sift meal with sugar and salt. Pour over this enough boiling milk or

Flavor with lemon, take from the range, and add the stiffly beaten
whites. Pour into molds and set in a cool place to get firm.

A pleasing effect may be obtained by dividing the mixture after it is
cooked, and coloring one-half pink, then filling the mold one-third of
one, and filling up with the other. When turned from the mold they will
look like small, white pyramids capped with pink, or pink with white. A
custard to be served with this blanc mange is made of two cups of milk,
the yolks of three eggs, and half a cup of sugar. Flavor same as blanc
mange.

break more than are necessary. Fill the cavity made by removing the pit
with malted nuts, and press together. Make an icing of the white of an
egg, eight or nine tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, a few drops of
lemon juice, and one teaspoonful of corn starch. Dip the dates in this,
using a sharp toothpick with which to handle them, and place on an
oiled paper or plate to dry. Or the icing may be made with less sugar,
and after they are dipped, roll them in powdered or Victor sugar.


SAGO FRUIT

    Sago, 1 cup.

till they absorb all the water. Turn onto a plate to cool and remove
stones. When tapioca has cooked until clear, put all the seasoning into
it, and put a layer into a pudding dish, then a layer of prunes, and so
on, having the top layer tapioca. Bake in moderate oven one hour; then
allow to partially cool, and serve with cream.

_CAKE_


FROSTING

    Egg white, beaten stiff, 1.
    Corn starch, 1 teaspoonful.
    Powdered sugar, 9 tablespoonfuls.
    Lemon or orange juice, 1 teaspoonful.

Mix and beat together.


SUNSHINE CAKE

    Egg whites, 6.
    Egg yolks, 3.
    Sugar, granulated, 1 cup.
    Flour, 1 scant cup.
    Lemon juice, 2 teaspoonfuls.

Mix and bake as for Favorite Sponge Cake, flavor with

    Grated rind of lemon.
    Juice of ½ orange.


ORANGE CAKE

If boiled icing flavored with orange is used, the result will be orange
cake.


ANGEL CAKE

    Flour, 1 cup sifted 5 times.
    Lemon juice, 2 teaspoonfuls.
    Powdered sugar, sifted, 1 cup.
    Egg whites, 11 beaten to stiff froth.
    Vanilla, 2 teaspoonfuls.

Stir the sugar into the whites very lightly and carefully, adding the
vanilla, after which add the flour, stirring quickly and lightly. Pour
into a bright, clean cake dish, which should not be buttered or lined.
Bake at once in a moderate oven about forty minutes. Test it with a
broom splint. When done, let it remain in the cake tin, turning it
upside down, with the sides resting on two saucers, so that a current
of air will pass over and under it.


SPONGE SHEET

Use and make the ingredients the same as for Simple Sponge Cake, but
bake in a sheet. Before baking, sprinkle a generous quantity of the
following mixture on top:--

Mix an equal quantity of granulated sugar and chopped almonds and add a
small pinch of ground cinnamon. This produces a delicious crust. Bake
in a buttered and floured pan, and remove from the pan as soon as done.


SIMPLE SPONGE CAKE

    Eggs, 6.
    Sifted granulated sugar, 1 cup.
    Flour, 1 scant cup.

To the eggs add sugar, and beat with a wire egg beater till the mixture
is thick and light colored. Then add the flour, folding it in gently.
Drop by the spoonful in an unbuttered pan, and bake in a moderate oven.
When done, invert the pan, letting it rest on cups till the cake is
cool, when it can easily be taken out. Thus suspended from the bottom
of the pan, the cake is stretched by its own weight, which makes
it lighter and more elastic than if left to fall by its weight in
cooling. The quantity given will make a small loaf cake, or two layers.


FAVORITE SPONGE CAKE

    Eggs, 6.
    Granulated sugar, 1 cup.
    Flour, 1 scant cup.
    Lemon juice, 2 teaspoonfuls.

Sift the flour and sugar four or five times. Beat the whites of the egg
to a stiff froth, adding the lemon juice. When half beaten, fold in
carefully in regular order the sugar, well-beaten yolks of eggs, and
the flour. Bake in a moderate oven.


NUT SPONGE CAKE

    Eggs, 7.
    Water, ¼ cup.
    Lemon extract, ¼ teaspoonful.
    Ground English walnut, ¾ cup.
    Sugar, 1¼ cups.
    Vanilla, 1 teaspoonful.
    Flour, 1 rounded cup.

Beat the yolks of the eggs till thick; boil sugar in water till it
spins a thread. Pour this into the yolks, beating all the time till
cool. Add the vanilla and lemon extract; mix flour with walnuts; mix
all together, and lastly stir in the stiffly-beaten whites. Bake in
tins lined with greased paper.


MARGUERITES

    Egg white, 1, partly beaten.
    Sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls.
    Chopped walnuts, ½ cup.

Stir together and spread on crackers, one inch wide by three or four
inches long. Bake a light brown.


SPONGE JELLY CAKE

    Eggs, 5.
    Lemons, 1.
    Sugar, 1 cup.
    Flour, 1 cup.

Beat the yolks till very thick, add sugar gradually, then the grated
rind and two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Fold in one-half of the
whites of the eggs, beaten very stiff, then one-half of the flour, the
other half of the whites, lastly the remainder of the flour. Bake in a
large dripping-pan fifteen minutes. Turn onto a cloth, trim the edges,
spread the jelly, and roll up. Wrap in the cloth and set aside to cool.


ALMOND MACAROONS

    Egg whites, 5.
    Rind of 1 lemon.
    Almond meal, 1 scant cup.
    Sugar, 2 cups.
    Flour, 1 cup.

Beat eggs stiff, add sugar, and beat very stiff; add lemon rind grated;
mix and add flour and almond meal. Drop on oiled pans in pieces the
size of a walnut, allowing plenty of room between each. Smooth with a
knife dipped in water. Bake a light brown.




_NUT BUTTER_


NUT BUTTER

Nut butter can be easily made in the home, but nearly all the prepared
nut foods on sale require expensive machinery and a steam plant to
produce, hence can not be made in the home.

Peanuts and almonds are the nuts most suitable for making nut butter.
The other varieties are difficult to blanch and do not make good
butter. The best variety of peanuts for making nut butter is the
Spanish shelled. They are the most easily blanched. Removing the skins
from the nuts after they are shelled is called blanching. Peanuts can
not be blanched unless they have been thoroughly heated.

To properly cook peanuts is the essential thing to produce a healthful,
palatable nut butter. This can be accomplished if care is exercised.
There are three ways of cooking them: namely, baking or roasting,
boiling, and steaming. The baking process is the easiest way, but care
should be used not to scorch them. Scorched or burnt peanuts are unfit
to use in any form.


PROCESS NO. 1

Put a layer of peanuts about one-half inch deep in a dripping-pan and
place on perforated shelf in a moderate oven. Allow them to bake slowly
for about one hour. Cook them until they are a light brown or straw
color. Shake the pan or stir the peanuts every few minutes. When the
kernels begin to crack and pop they brown very quickly and should be
watched closely.

A splendid way to cook them is to fill a tight-covered dish about
two-thirds full, place in the oven, and shake occasionally. When cooked
this way, they are not so liable to burn, and they retain their flavor
better. When they have cooked sufficiently, spread out at once. When
they have become quite cool, blanch as follows: This can be done by
rubbing them in the hands, or what is better, a coarse bag, or take
a piece of cloth and fold the ends together, forming a bag. Another
good device is a screen made of coarse wire. Rub them until the skins
are loose. The chaff can be removed by using a fan or by pouring them
from one dish to another where the wind is blowing. Look them over
carefully, removing defective nuts and foreign substances.

The next step is to grind them. The most practical family mill we
know of for grinding nuts, etc., is the Quaker City Mill (see cut and
description of same in this book).

Always grind freshly cooked nuts, as they do not make good butter when
left a day or two after being cooked.


PROCESS NO. 2

Thoroughly heat the nuts in an oven, but do not let them brown. Allow
them to cool, then blanch as described in process No. 1. Boil them from
three to four hours, until they are tender. Drain, spread out on tins,
and thoroughly dry them; then grind them through the mill.


PROCESS NO. 3

Heat and blanch the same as for No. 2. Grind them through a meat
chopper or the nut butter mill loosely adjusted. Then cook them in a
steam cooker about four hours. When tender, drain, spread on tins, and
thoroughly dry them. Then run them through the mill tightly adjusted.


SALTED NUT BUTTER

Prepare nuts as described in process No. 1. Sprinkle salt on the
kernels when grinding. It is much more preferable to grind the salt in
with the nuts than to mix it in the butter.


ALMOND BUTTER

Almond butter is more difficult to make than peanut butter, on account
of the difficulty in removing the skins. Dry heat does not loosen the
skins as it does the peanut. To blanch almonds, soak them in boiling
water from two to five minutes; then the skins become loose and can
be pinched off by pressing on the nut with the thumb and finger; the
skins will crack and the kernel pop out. Dry them in a slow oven until
they become thoroughly dry and crisp, taking care not to burn them.
Then grind them through a loosely adjusted mill. Place on tins or on a
cloth stretched over the stove until perfectly dry. Then grind then in
the nut butter mill tightly adjusted.

This makes excellent butter if the almonds are first-class and sweet.


BRAZIL NUT BUTTER

Remove the brown, woody skins with a sharp knife and put the nuts
through the mill. They may have to be broken up before they can be
ground. This butter is very good, but somewhat expensive. It is cheaper
to buy the nuts already shelled.


PEANUT MEAL

Heat the peanuts sufficiently to remove the skins, but do not brown
them. Blanch and look over. Boil or steam them until tender, taking
care to have them quite dry when done. Drain off all the water possible
and put them through a colander. Put on tins suspended over the stove,
or in a slow oven, with the door open, taking care not to brown them.
When perfectly dry and hard, grind through the mill loosely adjusted.
If it is not fine enough, spread out to dry some more, pass through the
mill again more tightly adjusted, but if the mill is too tight, it will
grind it into butter. A good plan is to rub it through a flour sieve.


NUT BUTTER FOR THE TABLE

Put one-half the amount of butter required for the meal into a bowl and
dilute with an equal quantity of water, adding a little of the water at
a time, beating it thoroughly with a fork until it is smooth and light.
Enough water should be used to make it the proper consistency to spread
nicely. An egg beater or wire potato masher is an excellent utensil for
mixing. A little salt can be added if desired. Nut butter when mixed
with water does not keep but a few hours.


PEANUT CREAM

Cook the peanuts until they just begin to turn brown. Then make into
butter, ground as fine as possible. Emulsify with water until it is
the consistency of milk. Then put in double boiler and cook until it
has become as thick as ordinary cream. A little salt can be added if
desired. Serve it hot or cold as preferred. It can be made into milk by
adding a little water.

  Quaker City Peanut Butter Mill

  [Illustration]

  Price of Mill $4.00

  This mill is tinned and has a ball bearing. Grinds dry, wet or
  oily substances. Weight ten pounds, capacity five pounds peanut
  butter per hour. This is not a cheap meat mill which will not
  grind fine, but a thoroughly practical grinding mill constructed
  on the same principles as our large mills, which have been used so
  successfully throughout the world for nearly a generation. It is a
  general grinding mill for family use, and is sold at a price within
  the reach of every family. The importance of pure food can not be
  overestimated. The surest way to get it is to do your own grinding,
  thus having the article freshly ground as you use it, and avoiding
  the danger of injurious adulterations. This mill is adapted to
  grinding or pulverizing any of the following articles:--

  Coffee, peanuts or nuts of any kind, all wet or oily substances,
  corn meal, cracker dust, bread crumbs, cracked wheat and oats,
  horseradish, and cooked meats, spices, herbs, and roots, vanilla
  beans and pods when mixed with sugar and ground together for
  flavoring; raisins, with or without seeds for marmalade, cocoanuts,
  etc. Peanut butter is said to be superior to codliver oil for
  consumptives. Send for circular containing directions for making
  peanut butter.
