PREFACE.


This is a modest little volume. It consists but
of selections from the Editor's note-book, and its
object is but to amuse. It does not even aspire
to be read consecutively. The Compiler's hope
is only that it may be found a pleasant companion
at spare moments--that it may be considered
handy for the pocket, and be thought agreeable to
dip into.

To that end, two things have been aimed at in
selecting--brevity and variety. There is scarcely
anything in the volume that cannot be read
almost at a glance, and the matter ranges over
a wide extent of literary effort--over play and
poem, over essay and novel, over maxim and epigram,
over memoir and diary. There is pun, and
there is parody; there is satire, and there is sarcasm.
In a word, the little book may say, with
Lafontaine, "Diversité c'est ma devise." There is
diversity even in the arrangement, which consists
merely of a general alternation of the prose and
verse. For the rest, the quips and quiddities are
in intentional disorder.

Let it be added that, though there are a few
anonymous passages, most are duly attributed to
their writers, together with references to the
volumes from which they have been taken. In
this, every care has been exercised to arrive at
accuracy. The idea of completeness is, of course,
foreign to a selection of this sort, and it may be
mentioned that the Editor has been specially
anxious to avoid as much as possible the ground
covered by Mr. Leigh in his "Jeux d'Esprit," and
by Mr. Dobson in his "Literary Frivolities." His
aim, indeed, has been to take the freshest and least
hackneyed of the passages in his collection, though
he has not hesitated to include a venerable saying
when it has seemed to him as good as it is venerable.

In conclusion, the Compiler desires to express
in the most hearty manner his indebtedness to
those numerous living writers whose bright and
airy fancies form, in his opinion, one of the chief
attractions of the book. He ought, perhaps, to
apologize to those writers for presenting their
fancies in a manner so generally fragmentary and
disconnected. But that the contents of the book
should be thus disconnected and fragmentary was
part and parcel of its plan and origin, and, that
being the case, the Editor hopes to be excused.
He may state that, in those few cases where a
piece of verse is given entire, it is distinguished
by the presence of a heading. The epigrams,
maxims, and anecdotes are, of course, reproduced
as written--being, in their very nature, of the
brevity essential to a quip.

Further: on the principle that no book, however
unpretending, should be without an Index, the
Compiler has supplied one for the present volume.

  QUIPS AND QUIDDITIES.


  When Miss Callender, afterwards Mrs. Sheridan,
  published a novel, the hero of which commits
  forgery, that wicked wit, Sydney Smith, said he
  knew she was a Callender, but did not know till then
  that she was a Newgate Calendar.

        FANNY KEMBLE, _Record of a Girlhood_.


  An estate and beauty joined, are of an unlimited, nay, a power
  pontifical; make one not only absolute, but infallible. A fine
  woman's never in the wrong.

        _Lady Betty_, in CIBBER's _Careless Husband_.


  _THEOPHILUS._

  When I'm drinking my tea
    I think of my _The_;
  When I'm drinking my coffee
    I think of my _Offee_;
  So, whether I'm drinking my tea or my coffee,
  I'm always a-thinking of thee, my Theoffy.

        ROGERS, _apud_ MOORE.


  Bobus was very amusing. He is a great authority
  on Indian matters. We talked of the insects
  and the snakes, and he said a thing which
  reminded me of his brother Sydney: "Always, sir,
  manage to have at your table some fleshy blooming
  young writer or cadet, just come out, that the mosquitoes
  may stick to him, and leave the rest of the company
  alone."

        LORD MACAULAY, _Life_.


  Lady Greenwich, in a conversation with
  Lady Tweeddale, named the Saxons. "The
  Saxons, my dear," cried the Marchioness; "who
  were they?" "Lord, madam, did your ladyship never
  read the History of England?" "No, my dear; pray,
  who wrote it?"

        HORACE WALPOLE, _Correspondence_.


  _ON THE MARRIAGE OF A MR. LOT AND A MISS SALTER._

  Because on her way she chose to halt,
  Lot's wife, in the Scriptures, was turned into salt;
  But though in her course she ne'er did falter,
  This young Lot's wife, strange to say, was Salter.

        HICKS, _apud_ J. C. YOUNG.


  Hook was dining at Powell's one day, and the talk
  fell upon _feu_ Jack Reeve. "Yes," said Theodore,
  when they were speaking of his funeral,
  "I met him in his private box, going to the pit."

  _TO A BAD FIDDLER._

  Old Orpheus played so well, he moved old Nick,
  While thou mov'st nothing but thy fiddlestick!

        _A Collection of Epigrams_ (1727).


  A lady from China who was dining with the
  Archbishop [Whately] told him that English
  flowers reared in that country lose their perfume
  in two or three years. "Indeed!" was the immediate
  remark, "I had no idea that the Chinese were such
  de-scent-ers."

        E. J. WHATELY's _Life of Whately_.


  _ON THE ART UNIONS._

  That Picture-Raffles will conduce to nourish
  Design, or cause good colouring to flourish,
  Admits of logic-chopping and wise-sawing:
  But surely Lotteries encourage Drawing?

        THOMAS HOOD, _Whims and Oddities_.


  Robert Smith (brother of Sydney, and familiarly
  called "Bobus") was a lawyer and an
  ex-Advocate-General, and happened on one
  occasion to be engaged in argument with an excellent
  physician touching the merits of their respective professions.
  "You must admit," urged Dr. ----, "that
  your profession does not make angels of men." "No,"
  was the retort, "there you have the best of it; yours
  certainly gives them the first chance."

        ABRAHAM HAYWARD, _Essays_.


  In London I never know what I'd be at,
  Enraptured with this, and enchanted by that;
  I'm wild with the sweets of variety's plan,
  And Life seems a blessing too happy for man.

  But the Country, Lord help me! sets all matters right;
  So calm and composing from morning to night;
  Oh! it settles the spirits when nothing is seen
  But an ass on a common, a goose on a green.

        CHARLES MORRIS, _Lyra Urbanica_.


  Parler d'amour, c'est faire amour.

        BALZAC, _Physiologie du Mariage_.


  At the Polish ball, the Lord Mayor said to Lady
  Douglas, who squints, "Which do you prefer,
  my lady, Gog or Magog?" "Of the _three_,"
  said Lady Douglas, "I prefer your lordship!"

  _ON THE CAPPADOCIANS._

  A viper bit a Cappadocian's hide;
  But 'twas the viper, not the man, that died.

        ANON., _from the Greek_.


  The merits of a certain American diplomatist being
  on the _tapis_, [Washington Irving] said, in allusion
  to his pomposity, "Ah, he is a great man;
  and, in his own estimation, a very great man--a man of
  great weight. When he goes to the West, the East
  tips up."

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  When a rapt audience has encored "Fra Poco"
  Or "Casta Diva," I have heard that then
  The Prima Donna, smiling herself out,
  Recruits her flagging powers with bottled stout.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Verses and Translations_.


  I believe everything. It saves one such a world
  of bore from intelligent people who are anxious
  to explain things you doubt about.

        _Lucy Forrester_, in BROOKS' _Aspen Court_.


  Rank so friendly now with trade is,
  Bill discounters titled ladies
                  Stoop to raise.
  Manners used to make the man,
  It is only money can
                  Nowadays.

        J. JEMMETT BROWNE, _Songs of Many Seasons_.


  Black is a great fact. Want of fashion in the cut;
  want of richness in the material; want of _chic_
  in the wearer--all these it covers, like charity.
  There's a sentiment about it which appeals to the feelings,
  and it is becoming to the skin.

        ANNA C. STEELE.


  Are you quite sure that Pygmalion is the only
  person who ever fell in love with his own
  handiwork?

        _Guesses at Truth._


  Duty,--that's to say the complying
        With whate'er's expected here,
  On your unknown cousin's dying,
        Straight be ready with the tear;
  Upon etiquette relying,
  Unto usage nought denying,
  Lend your waist to be embraced,
        Blush not even, never fear.

        A. H. CLOUGH, _Poems_.


  What Jenner said on hearing in Elysium that
  complaints had been made of his having a statue
  in Trafalgar Square:--

  England, ingratitude still blots
  The escutcheon of the brave and free:
  I saved you many million spots,
  And now you grudge one spot to me.

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  Deh! what are we sinners doing all our lives?
  Making soup in a basket, and getting nothing
  but the scum for our stomachs.

        _Machiavelli_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Romola_.


  My idea of an agreeable person is a person who
  agrees with me.

        _Hugo Bohun_, in LORD BEACONSFIELD's _Lothair_.


  "Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail,
  "There's the porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.
  See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
  They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?

  "You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
  When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!"
  But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!" and gave a look askance,
  Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Alice in Wonderland_.


  I could draw on wood at a very tender age.
  When a mere child I once drew a small cartload
  of turnips over a wooden bridge. The people
  of the village noticed me. I drew their attention.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  That all-softening over-powering knell,
  The tocsin of the soul--the dinner-bell.

        LORD BYRON, _Don Juan_.


  Now Darwin proves as clear as mud,
  That, endless ages ere the Flood,
  The Coming Man's primeval form
  Was simply an Ascidian worm:
  And having then the habit got
  Of passing liquor down his throat,
  He keeps it still, and shows full well
  That Man--was--once----a leather bottèl.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.


  "The ancients," quoth Paul, "were very great
  men, Mr. MacGrawler."
  "They were so, sir," returned the critic;
  "we make it a rule in our profession to assert that fact."
  "But, sir," said Paul, "they are wrong now and then."
  "Never, Ignoramus, never."
  "They praised poverty, Mr. MacGrawler," said Paul,
  with a sigh.
  "Hem," quoth the critic, a little staggered; but presently
  recovering his characteristic acumen, he observed,
  "It is true, Paul, but that was the poverty of other
  people."

        LORD LYTTON, _Paul Clifford_.


  Yes, Fortune deserves to be chidden,
    It is a coincidence queer--
    Whenever one wants to be hidden
  Some blockhead is sure to appear!

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  One day in the country [Sheridan Knowles] said to
  Abbot, with whom he had been acting there,
  "My dear fellow, I'm off to-morrow. Can I
  take any letters for you?" "You're very kind," answered
  Abbot; "but where are you going to?" "_I haven't
  made up my mind._"

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  _BLUE STOCKINGS._

  The newspapers lately have taught us to know
  How some strong-minded hens are beginning to crow.
  But, dear ladies, beware: take the word of a friend,
  That when rivalry comes, all affection must end.
  With the brightest of _spoons_ would be war to the _knife_
  In political contests 'twixt husband and wife;
  And the sentence of doom might be sudden and brief
  If a feminine subaltern jilted her chief.
  We men take a pride in concealing our chains,
  And would like to be thought to monopolize brains;
  So I'll give you this maxim, my counsels to crown--
  _If the stockings are blue, keep the petticoats down._

        _Once a Week._


  Talking of Kean, I mentioned his having told
  me that he had eked out his means of living,
  before he emerged from obscurity, by teaching
  dancing, fencing, elocution, and boxing. "Elocution
  and boxing!" (repeated Bobus Smith)--"a word and a
  blow."

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  _MILITARY._

  Smart soldiers like to be well tightened in:
  Loose habits would destroy all discipline.

        H. J. BYRON, in _English Epigrams_.


  Fontaine, the architect, who built the triumphal
  arch in the Carrousel, placed upon it an empty
  car, drawn by the famous bronze Venetian
  horses. Talleyrand asked him, "_Qui avez vous l'intention
  de mettre dans le char?_" The answer was, "_L'Empereur
  Napoléon, comme de raison_." Upon which Talleyrand
  said, "_Le char l'attend_."

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  'Tis doubtless well to be sometimes awake--
    Awake to duty, and awake to truth,--
  But when, alas! a nice review we take
    Of our best deeds and days, we find, in sooth,
  The hours that leave the slightest cause to weep
  Are those we passed in childhood or asleep!

        JOHN GODFREY SAXE, _Poems_.


  _Sir Toby._ "Does not our life consist of the four
  elements?"
  _Sir Andrew._ "Faith, so they say; but I think
  it rather consists of eating and drinking."

        _Twelfth Night_, Act II., Scene 3.


  She thought "Wives and Daughters" "_so_ jolly;"
    "Had I read it?" She knew that I had:
  Like the rest, I should dote upon "Molly;"
    And "poor Mrs. Gaskell--how sad!"
  "Like Browning?" "But so-so." His proof lay
    Too deep for her frivolous mood,
  That preferred your mere metrical _soufflé_
    To the stronger poetical food;
  Yet at times he was good--"as a tonic:"
    Was Tennyson writing just now?
  And was this new poet Byronic,
    And clever, and naughty, or how?

        AUSTIN DOBSON, _Vignettes in Rhyme_.


  Old friends are best. King James used to call for
  his old shoes; they were easiest for his feet.

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  Let a coach be called,
  And let the man who called it be the caller;
  And in his calling let him nothing call,
  But coach, coach, coach! Oh for a coach, ye gods!

        CAREY, _Chrononhotonthologos_.


  If you could make a pudding wi' thinking o' the
  batter, it 'ud be easy getting dinner.

        _Mrs. Poyser_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  There's somewhat on my breast, father,
    There's somewhat on my breast;
  The livelong day I sigh, father,
    And at night I cannot rest.
  'Tis not the lack of gold, father,
    Nor want of worldly gear;
  My lands are broad, and fair to see,
    My friends are kind and dear.

  'Tis not that Janet's false, father,
    'Tis not that she's unkind;
  Though busy flatterers swarm around,
    I know her constant mind.
  'Tis not her coldness, father,
    That chills my labouring breast:
  It's that confounded cucumber
    I've eat and can't digest.

        R. H. BARHAM, _Ingoldsby Lyrics_.


  Insolence is a charming quality, when, like
  mercy, it is not strained.

        _Once a Week._


  Ancient Phillis has young graces,
    'Tis a strange thing, but a true one!
          Shall I tell you how?
  She, herself, makes her own faces,
    And each morning wears a new one;
          Where's the wonder now?

        _Lord Froth_, in CONGREVE's _Double Dealer_.


  Célébrité--l'avantage d'être connu de ceux que
  vous ne connaissez pas.

        CHAMFORT, _Maximes_.


  'Tis past all bearing, when a husband slights his bride,
  Who last Christmas still was blushing at her elder sister's side;
  Still on some minute allowance finding collars, boots, and gloves,
  Still to cousinly flirtations limiting her list of loves,
  Still by stern domestic edict charged on no account to read
  Any of Miss Brontë's novels, or to finish _Adam Bede_.

        _First Lady_, in TREVELYAN's _Ladies in Parliament_.


  I differ from all the ordinary biographers of
  that independent gentleman Don't Care. I
  believe Don't Care came to a good end. At any
  rate he came to some end. Whereas numbers of people
  never have beginning, or ending, of their own.

        _Ellesmere_, in HELPS's _Friends in Council_.


  _DISTICH._

  Wisely a woman prefers to a lover a man who neglects her.
  This one may love her some day; some day the lover will not.

        JOHN HAY, _Poems_.


  One morning [Jerrold and Compton] proceeded
  together to view the pictures in the Gallery of
  Illustration. On entering the ante-room, they
  found themselves opposite to a number of very long
  looking-glasses. Pausing before one of these, [Compton]
  remarked to Jerrold, "You've come here to admire
  works of art! Very well, first feast your eyes on that
  work of nature!"--pointing to his own figure reflected
  in the glass; "look at it, there's a picture for you!"
  "Yes," said Jerrold, regarding it intently, "very fine,
  very fine indeed!" Then, turning to his friend: "Wants
  hanging, though!"

        _Memoir of Henry Compton._


  Sing for the garish eye,
    When moonless brandlings cling!
  Let the froddering crooner cry,
    And the braddled sapster sing.
  For never, and never again,
    Will the tottering beechlings play,
  For bratticed wrackers are singing aloud,
    And the throngers croon in May!

        W. S. GILBERT.


  Sydney Smith said of a certain quarrelsome
  person that his very face was a breach of the
  peace.

        J. T. FIELDS, _Yesterdays with Authors_.


  Kerchief in hand I saw them stand;
    In every kerchief lurked a lunch;
  When they unfurl'd them it was grand
    To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch
  The sounding celery-stick, or ram
  The knife into the blushing ham.

  Dash'd the bold fork through pies of pork;
    O'er hard-boil'd eggs the saltspoon shook;
  Leapt from its lair the playful cork:
    Yet some there were, to whom the brook
  Seemed sweetest beverage, and for meat
  They chose the red root of the beet.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  Of all virtues, magnanimity is the rarest. There
  are a hundred persons of merit for one who
  willingly acknowledges it in another.

        W. HAZLITT, _Characteristics_.


  Bisness first, pleasure artervards, as King Richard
  the Third said ven he stabbed the tother king in
  the Tower, afore he murdered the babbies.

        CHARLES DICKENS, _apud_ J. T. FIELDS.


  We are all of us liable to this error of imagining
  that we are grieved at a fault, when we are only
  grieved at having done something to lower ourselves
  in our own estimation.

        E. M. SEWELL, _Margaret Percival_.


  I trembled once beneath her spell
  Whose spelling was extremely so-so.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  It's easy finding reasons why other folks should be
  patient.

        _Bartle Massey_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.

  _OUR TRAVELLER._

  If thou wouldst stand on Etna's burning brow,
  With smoke above, and roaring flames below;
  And gaze adown that molten gulf reveal'd
  Till thy soul shudder'd, and thy senses reel'd;--
  If thou wouldst beard Niagara in his pride,
  Or stem the billows of Propontic tide;
  Scale all alone some dizzy Alpine _haut_,
  And shriek "Excelsior!" amidst the snow;--
  Wouldst tempt all deaths, all dangers that may be,
  Perils by land, and perils on the sea,--
  This vast round world, I say, if thou wouldst view it,
  Then why the dickens don't you go and do it?

        H. CHOLMONDELEY PENNELL, _Puck on Pegasus_.


  I am saddest when I sing; so are those who hear
  me. They are sadder even than I am.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  An ape with a pliable thumb and big brain,
  When the gift of the gab he had managed to gain,
  As a lord of creation established his reign,
                          Which nobody can deny.

  But I'm sadly afraid, if we do not take care,
  A relapse to low life may our prospects impair,
  So of beastly propensities let us beware,
                          Which nobody can deny.

  Their lofty position our children may lose,
  And, reduced to all-fours, must then narrow their views,
  Which would shortly unfit them for wearing our shoes,
                          Which nobody can deny.

  Their vertebræ next might be taken away,
  When they'd sink to an oyster, or insect, some day,
  Or the pitiful part of a polypus play,
                          Which nobody can deny.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.


  It's dreadful to think on, people playing with their
  own insides in that way! And it's flying i' the
  face o' Providence; for what are the doctors for,
  if we aren't to call 'em in?

         _Mrs. Pullet_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Mill on the Floss_.


  Brief, in two rules he summed the ends of man--
  Keep all you have, and try for all you can!

        LORD LYTTON, _King Arthur_.


  _LOVE SONG._

  What mistress half so dear as mine,
    Half so well dressed, so pungent, fragrant,
  Who can such attributes combine,
    To charm the constant, fix the vagrant?
  Who can display such varied arts,
    To suit the taste of saint and sinner,
  Who go so near to touch their hearts,
    As thou, my darling dainty dinner?

  Still my breast holds a rival queen,
    A bright-eyed nymph of sloping shoulders,
  Whose ruddy cheeks and graceful mien
    Entrance the sense of all beholders.
  Oh! when thy lips to mine are pressed,
    What transports titillate my throttle!
  My love can find new life and zest,
    In thee, and thee alone, my bottle!

        HORACE SMITH, _The Tin Trumpet_.


  Fashion with us is like the man in one of Le
  Sage's novels, who was constantly changing his
  servants, and yet had but one suit of livery,
  which every newcomer, whether he was tall or short, fat
  or thin, was obliged to wear.

  _Wormwood_, in LORD LYTTON's _Pelham_.


  Unmarketable maidens of the mart,
  Who, plumpness gone, fine delicacy feint,
  And hide your sins in piety and paint.

        ALFRED AUSTIN, _The Season_.


  Seeing O. Smith, the popular melodramatic actor,
  on the opposite side of the Strand, Knowles
  rushed across the road, seized him by the hand,
  and inquired eagerly after his health. Smith, who only
  knew him by sight, said, "I think, Mr. Knowles, you

  Knowles, "I beg you ten thousand pardons: I took
  you for your _namesake_, T. P. Cooke!"

        MARK TWAIN, _Choice Works_.


  He lived in a cave by the seas,
    He lived upon oysters and foes,
  But his list of forbidden degrees
    An extensive morality shows;
  Geological evidence goes
    To prove he had never a pan,
  But he shaved with a shell when he chose,--
    'Twas the manner of Primitive Man.

  He worshipped the rain and the breeze,
    He worshipped the river that flows,
  And the dawn, and the moon, and the trees,
    And bogies, and serpents, and crows;
  He buried his dead with their toes
    Tucked-up, an original plan,
  Till their knees came right under their nose,--
    'Twas the manner of Primitive Man.

  Would you adopt a strong logical attitude,
    Bear this in mind, and, whatever you do,
  Always allow your opponent full latitude,
    Whether or not his assumption be true.
  Then, when he manifests feelings of gratitude
    Merely because you've not shut him up flat,
  Turn his pet paradox into a platitude
    With the remark, "Oh, of _course_, we know that!"

  The gentle reader, who may wax unkind,
  And, caring little for the author's ease,

  My dear, when you have a clergyman in your
  family you must accommodate your tastes: I
  did that very early. When I married Humphrey,
  I made up my mind to like sermons, and I set out by
  liking the end very much. That soon spread to the
  middle and the beginning, because I couldn't have the
  end without them.

  Great theologians, talk not of Trinity:

  "Is that the contents you are looking at?" inquired

  The river's like glass--
  As slowly I pass,
  This sweet little lass

  And as I float by,
  Said I, "Miss, O why?
  O why may not I

  "I've no room in my heart--

  Kenny one day mentioned Charles Lamb's being

  I remember being present at a dinner in
  London, when a very severe and saturnine

  said Theodore Hook, "every Sunday morning."

  Plain food is quite enough for me;
    Three courses are as good as ten;
  If Nature can subsist on three,
    Thank heaven for three--Amen!
  I always thought cold victual nice--
  My _choice_ should be vanilla-ice.

  I care not much for gold or land;
    Give me a mortgage here or there;
  Some good bank-stock, some note of hand,

  I only ask that fortune send
  A _little_ more than I shall spend.

  Some one saying to Sir F. Gould, "I am told you

  The late Mr. Nightingale was telling Horace Smith
  of his having given a late royal duke an account
  of an accident he had met with when he had been
  run away with, and of the duke's exclaiming aloud to himself,
  when he heard he had jumped out of the carriage,
  "Fool! fool!" "Now," said the narrator to his auditor,
  "it's all very well for him to call me a fool, but I can't
  conceive why he should. Can you?" "No," replied
  the wag, as if reflecting, "because he could not suppose
  you ignorant of the fact."

  Such are the sylvan scenes that thrill
    This heart! The lawns, the happy shade
  Where matrons, whom the sunbeams grill,

  And maidens flirt (no extra charge)
  In comfort at the fountain's marge!

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  The crow!--the crow!--the great black crow!
  He loves the fat meadow--his taste is low;

  But it is jolly to fare like a great black crow!

  I heard the other day of Jekyll making the
  following pun. He said, "Erskine used to
  hesitate very much, and could not speak very

  speechifying that I asked him whether it was in honour
  of the Company that he _floundered_ so?"

  Who knows if what Adam might speak
    Was mono- or poly-syllabic;
  Was Gothic, or Gaelic, or Greek,

  The Duke of Rutland, at one of his levées,
  being at a loss for something to say to every
  person he was bound in etiquette to notice,
  remarked to Sir John Hamilton that there was a prospect
  of an excellent crop. "The timely rain," observed
  the duke, "will bring everything above ground." "God

  excellency stared, whilst Sir John continued, sighing
  heavily as he spoke, "Yes, God forbid! for I have
  _three wives_ under it!"

  "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak

  "In my youth," said his father, "I took to the law,

  My old friend Maltby, the brother of the bishop, was
  a very absent man. One day at Paris, in the
  Louvre, we were looking at the pictures, when a

  I could resign that eye of blue,
    Howe'er its splendour used to thrill me;
  And e'en that cheek of roseate hue--
    To lose it, Chloe, would not kill me.

  That sunny neck I ne'er should miss,
    However much I raved about it;
  And sweetly as that lip can kiss,
    I think I could exist without it.

  In short, so well I've learned to fast,
    That, sooth, my love, I know not whether
  I might not bring myself at last
    To do without you altogether.

  We don't marry beggars, said she: why, no:

  A man for himself should be able to scratch,

  I make the butter fly, all in an hour:
    I put aside the preserves and cold meats,
  Telling my master his cream has turned sour,
    Hiding his pickles, purloining his sweets.
  I never languish for husband or dower,
    I never sigh to see gyps at my feet:

    Taking it home for my Saturday treat.

  English is an expressive language, but not

  consists, so far as I can observe, of four words:
  "nice," "jolly," "charming," and "bore;" and some
  grammarians add "fond."

  Ah! who has seen the mailèd lobster rise,
  Clap her broad wings, and, soaring, claim the skies?
  When did the owl, descending from her bower,
  Crop, 'midst the fleecy flocks, the tender flower;
  Or the young heifer plunge, with pliant limb,
  In the salt wave, and fish-like strive to swim?
  The same with plants--potatoes 'tatoes breed,
  The costly cabbage springs from cabbage-seed;
  Lettuce to lettuce, leeks to leeks, succeed;
  Nor e'er did cooling cucumbers presume
  To flower like myrtle, or like violets bloom.

  One of Lord Dudley's eccentric habits was that of

  If a daughter you have, she's the plague of your life,
  No peace shall you know, though you've buried your wife!
  At twenty she mocks at the duty you've taught her--
  O, what a plague is an obstinate daughter!
        Sighing and whining,
        Dying and pining,
  O, what a plague is an obstinate daughter!

  When scarce in their teens, they have wit to perplex us,
  With letters and lovers for ever they vex us;
  While each still rejects the fair suitor you've brought her;
  O, what a plague is an obstinate daughter!

  O, what a plague is an obstinate daughter!

  Should yours (kind heaven, avert the omen!)
  Like the cravats of vulgar, low men,
  Asunder start--and, yawning wide,
  Disclose a chasm on either side;
  Or should it stubbornly persist
  To take some awkward tasteless twist,
  Some crease, indelible, and look
  Just like a dunce's dog-eared book,
  How would you parry the disgrace?
  In what assembly show your face?
  How brook your rival's scornful glance,
  Or partners' titter in the dance?
  How in the morning dare to meet
  The quizzers of the park and street?
  Your occupation's gone; in vain
  Hope to dine out, or flirt again.
  The ladies from their lists would put you,
  And even _I_, my friend, must cut you!

        H. LUTTRELL, _Letters to Julia_.


  A man can never manage a woman. Till a woman

  I am lying, we'll say, in the nook I love,
    Screened from the sunlight's scorching glow,
  Watching the big clouds up above,

  Blowing a cloud from my meerschaum black,
    And thinking or not as I feel inclined,
  With a light alpaca coat on my back,
    And nothing particular on my mind.

        ALFRED AUSTIN, _The Season_.


  Another friend assured me it was policy to
  "feed a cold and starve a fever." I had both.
  So I thought it best to feed myself up for the
  cold, and then keep dark and let the fever starve awhile.
  In a case of this kind, I seldom do things by halves.
  I ate pretty heartily. I conferred my custom upon a
  stranger who had just opened his restaurant that morning.
  He waited near me in respectful silence, until I had
  finished feeding my cold, when he inquired if the people
  about Virginia were much afflicted with colds? I told
  him I thought they were. He then went out and took in
  his sign.

  A fine lady is like a cat; when young, the most
  gamesome and lively of all creatures--when old,
  the most melancholy.

        ALEXANDER POPE, in LOCKER's _Patchwork_.


  'Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare
  "You have baked me quite brown, I must sugar my hair."
  As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
  Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Alice in Wonderland_.


  Poor relations are undeniably irritating--their
  existence is so entirely uncalled for on our part,
  and they are almost always very faulty people.

        GEORGE ELIOT, _Mill on the Floss_.


  There was an APE in the days that were earlier;
  Centuries passed, and his hair became curlier:
  Centuries more gave a thumb to his wrist--
    Then he was MAN, and a Positivist.


  MORTIMER COLLINS, _The British Birds_.


  It was observed he never gave an opinion on any
  subject, and never told an anecdote. Indeed,
  he would sometimes remark, when a man fell
  into his anecdotage it was a sign for him to retire from
  the world.

        LORD BEACONSFIELD, _Lothair_.


  You cannot eat breakfast all day,
    Nor is it the act of a sinner,
  When breakfast is taken away,
    To turn your attention to dinner;
  And it's not in the range of belief,
    That you could hold him as a glutton,
  Who, when he is tired of beef,
    Determines to tackle the mutton.

        _Defendant_, in W. S. GILBERT's _Trial by Jury_.


  Had the Romans public dinners? Answer me
  that. Imagine a Roman--whose theory at least
  of a dinner was that it was a thing for enjoyment,
  whereas we often look on it as a continuation of the
  business of the day,--I say, imagine a Roman girding
  himself up, literally girding himself up, to make an after
  dinner speech.

        _Ellesmere_, in HELPS's _Friends in Council_.


  Folks will teach you when at school--
      "Never tell a lie!"
  Nonsense: if you're not a fool
  You may always break the rule,
      But you must be sly;
  For they'll whip you, past a doubt,
  If they ever find you out.

  Folks say, "Children should not let
      Angry passions rise."
  Humbug! When you're in a pet
  Why on earth should you regret
      Blacking some one's eyes?
  Children's eyes are made, in fact,
  Just on purpose to be black'd.

        H. S. LEIGH, _Carols of Cockayne_.

  _A FAITHFUL PAGE._

  Nearly one hundred years ago, my grandfather,
  Captain William Locker, was at dinner, and a
  servant-boy, lately engaged, was handing him a
  tray of liqueurs, in different-sized glasses. Being in the
  middle of an anecdote to his neighbour, he mechanically
  held out his hand towards the tray, but, as people often
  do when they are thinking of something else, he did not
  take a glass. The boy thought he was hesitating which
  liqueur he would have, and, like a good fellow, wishing
  to help his master, he pointed to one particular glass,
  and whispered, "That's the biggest, sir."

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _Patchwork_.


  All men are equal, the Frenchman says;
        Most men will gladly receive
  What a fervid fool, with a flattering phrase,
        Tricks out for fools to believe;
  But these men have less brains than a wren!
        When a larch is a lily,
        And Bessy like Billy
        A beard shall achieve,
        Then I will believe
  That equality reigns among men!

  "Yes," he exclaimed, "as the sublime Tyndall tells
  us, let us struggle to attain to a deeper knowledge
  of matter, and a more faithful conformity
  to its laws!"

  The professor would have proceeded, but the weather
  had been rapidly growing rough, and he here became
  violently sea-sick.

  "Let us," he exclaimed hurriedly, "conform to the
  laws of matter and go below."

  Hicks and Thackeray, walking together, stopped
  opposite a doorway, over which was inscribed in
  gold letters these words: "Mutual Loan Office."
  They both seemed equally puzzled. "What on earth can
  that mean?" asked Hicks. "I don't know," answered
  Thackeray, "unless it means, that two men, who have
  nothing, agree to lend it to one another."

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  A clod--a piece of orange-peel--

  He dropt a tear on Susan's bier,
    He seem'd a most despairing swain;
  Yet bluer sky brought newer tie,
    And would he wish her back again?
  The moments fly, and when we die
    Will Philly Thistletop complain?
  She'll cry and sigh, and--dry her eye,
    And let herself be woo'd again.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  One 'ud think, an hear some folks talk, as the
  men war 'cute enough to count the corns in a
  bag o' wheat wi' only smelling at it. They can
  see through a barn door, they can. Perhaps that's the
  reason they see so little o' this side on't.

  _A KISS._

  Rose kissed me to-day,--
    Will she kiss me to-morrow?
  Let it be as it may,
  Rose kissed me to-day.
  But the pleasure gives way
    To a savour of sorrow;--
  Rose kissed me to-day,--
    _Will_ she kiss me to-morrow?

        AUSTIN DOBSON, _Proverbs in Porcelain_.


  Humility is a virtue all preach, none practise,
  and yet everybody is content to hear.

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  Some say that the primitive tongue
    Expressed but the simplest affections;
  And swear that the words said or sung
    Were nothing but mere interjections.
  _Oh! Oh!_ was the signal of pain;
    _Ha! Ha!_ was the symptom of laughter;
  _Pooh! Pooh!_ was the sign of disdain,
    And _Hillo!_ came following after.

  Some, taking a different view,
    Maintain the old language was fitted
  To mark out the objects we knew,
    By mimicking sounds they emitted.
  _Bow, wow_, was the name of a dog,
    _Quack, quack_, was the word for a duckling,
  _Hunc, hunc_, would designate a hog,
    And _wee, wee_, a pig and a suckling.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.

  And, placing raillery in railing,
  Proclaims aloud your greatest failing.

  I have always been more or less mixed up with

  If a man who turnips cries

  "You are old, Father William," the young man said,
    "And your hair has become very white;
  And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
    Do you think, at your age, it is right?"

  "In my youth," Father William replied to his son,
    "I feared it might injure my brain;
  But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
    Why, I do it again and again."

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Alice in Wonderland_.


  When the question arose how the title of Herold's

  When I left the man in gaiters,
    He was grumbling, o'er his gin,
  At the charges of the hostess
    Of that famous Flemish inn;
  And he looked a very Briton
    (So, methinks, I see him still)
  As he pocketed the candle
    That was mentioned in the bill!

  _ON PATRONS' PROMISES._

  A minister's answer is always so kind!
  I starve, and he tells me he'll keep me in mind.
  Half his promise, God knows, would my spirits restore--
  Let him keep me, and, faith, I will ask for no more.

        LORD HOLLAND, in MOORE's _Diary_.


  I know there's a stage of speculation in which a
  man may doubt whether a pickpocket is blameworthy--but
  I'm not one of your subtle fellows
  who keep looking at the world through their own legs.

        _Felix Holt_, in GEORGE ELIOT's novel.


  "A knock-me-down sermon, and worthy of Birch,"
  Says I to my wife, as we toddle from church.
  "Convincing, indeed!" is the lady's remark;
  "How logical, too, on the size of the Ark!"
  Then Blossom cut in, without begging our pardons,
  "Pa, was it as big as the 'Logical Gardens?"

  "Miss Blossom," says I, to my dearest of dearies,
  "Papa disapproves of nonsensical queries;
  The Ark was an Ark, and had people to build it,
  Enough we are told Noah built it and fill'd it:
  Mamma does not ask how he caught his opossums."
  --Said she, "That remark is as foolish as Blossom's!"

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Books are fatal: they are the curse of the human
  race. Nine-tenths of existing books are nonsense,
  and the clever books are the refutation of
  that nonsense. The greatest misfortune that ever befell
  man was the invention of printing.

        Phoebus, in LORD BEACONSFIELD's _Lothair_.


  We can't assume, so Comte declares, a first or final cause, sir;
  Phenomena are all we know, their order and their laws, sir;
  While Hegel's modest formula, a single line to sum in,
  Is "Nothing is, and nothing's not, but everything's becomin'."

        F. D., in _Pall Mall Gazette_.


  If you wish particularly to gain the good graces and
  affection of certain people, men or women, try
  to discover their most striking merit, if they have
  one, and their dominant weakness, for every one has his
  own. Then do justice to the one, and a little more than
  justice to the other.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  Tender ten may dote on toys,

        ALFRED AUSTIN, _The Season_.


  In the days when Pam retained the wheel,
  We knew the men with whom we had to deal;
  Then sucking statesmen seldom failed in seeing
  The final cause and import of their being.
  They dressed; they drove a drag; nor sought to shirk
  Their portion of the matrimonial work.
  They flocked to rout and drum by tens and twelves;
  Danced every dance, and left their cards themselves,
  While some obliging senatorial fag
  Slipped their petitions in the Speaker's bag.

        _Lady Matilda_, in G. O. TREVELYAN's _Ladies in Parliament_.


  Monk Lewis was a great favourite at Oatlands.
  One day after dinner, as the duchess was leaving
  the room, she whispered something in Lewis's
  ear. He was much affected, his eyes filling with tears.
  We asked him what was the matter. "Oh," replied
  Lewis, "the duchess spoke so _very_ kindly to me!"
  "My dear fellow," said Colonel Armstrong, "pray don't
  cry; I dare say she didn't mean it."

  A plain leg of mutton, my Lucy,
    I prithee get ready at three;
  Have it smoking and tender and juicy,
    And what better meat can there be?

  And when it has feasted the master,
    'Twill amply suffice for the maid;
  Meanwhile, I will smoke my canaster,
    And tipple my ale in the shade.

  A brother actor, who had not exactly "taken
  the house by storm" at his first appearance in
  London, very stupidly asked Compton: "Was

  word!"

        H. HOWE, in _Memoir of Henry Compton_.


  So when two dogs are fighting in the streets,
  When a third dog one of the two dogs meets,
  With angry tooth he bites him to the bone,
  And this dog smarts for what that dog has done.

        FIELDING, _Tom Thumb_.


  I recollect a humorous M.P. pointing out to
  me a retired West Indian judge not very remarkable
  for sagacity on the bench. There was a
  ball at Government House, and the judge began to criticise
  the dancing of a witty member of the Indian bar.
  "Ah, my friend, you are a bad waltzer!" "Ah, but you
  are a bad judge."

        MARK BOYD, _Reminiscences_.


  _Mrs. Cripps_: Things are seldom what they seem:
      Skim milk masquerades as cream;
      Highlows pass as patent leathers;
      Jackdaws strut in peacocks' feathers.

      _Captain_: Very true,
                      So they do.

  _Mrs. Cripps_: Black sheep dwell in every fold;
      All that glitters is not gold;
      Storks turn out to be but logs;
      Bulls are but inflated frogs.

      _Captain_: So they be,

  A friend meeting Sir George Rose one day in
  Lincoln's Inn Fields, with his left eye greatly

  Sir George, "I am out _jure mariti_" (my right eye).

  "Edwin and Morcar, the Earls of Mercia and
  Northumbria, declared for him; and even
  Stigand, the patriotic Archbishop of Canterbury,
  found it advisable----"
  "Found _what?_" said the Duck.
  "Found _it_," the Mouse replied, rather crossly; "of
  course you know what 'it' means."
  "I know what 'it' means well enough, when _I_ find a
  thing," said the Duck; "it's generally a frog or a worm.
  The question is, what did the archbishop find?"

  How beautifully blue the sky,
  The glass is rising very high,

  The Dowager-Duchess of Richmond went one Sunday
  with her daughter to the Chapel Royal at

         _Parson Lingon_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Felix Holt_.


  _Dulce_ it is, and _decorum_, no doubt, for the country to fall,--to
  Offer one's blood an oblation to Freedom, and die for the Cause; yet
  Still, individual culture is also something, and no man
  Finds quite distinct the assurance that he of all others is called on,
  Or would be justified even, in taking away from the world that
  Precious creature himself.

        _Claude_, in CLOUGH's _Amours de Voyage_.

  The speech of Old England for me;
    It serves us on every occasion;
  Henceforth, like our soil, let it be
    Exempted from foreign invasion.
  It answers for friendship and love,
    For all sorts of feeling and thinking,
  And lastly, all doubt to remove--
    It answers for singing and drinking.

  It was in my schoolboy days that I failed as an
  actor. The play was the "Ruins of Pompeii."
  I played the Ruins. It was not a very successful
  performance, but it was better than the "Burning Mountains."
  He was not good. He was a bad Vesuvius.

        ALFRED AUSTIN, _The Season_.


  A lady of my acquaintance, a brunette, happened
  to show her maid one of those little sticking-plaster
  profiles which they used to call _silhouettes_.
  It was the portrait of the lady's aunt, whom the girl had
  never seen, and she said quite innocently, "La, ma'am,
  I always thought as how you had some black relations,
  you are so dark-like yourself, you know!"

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _Patchwork_.


  He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
    And heard a voice in all the winds; and then,
  He thought of wood nymphs and immortal bowers,
    And how the goddesses came down to men:
  He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
    And when he look'd upon his watch again,
  He found how much old Time had been a winner--
  He also found that he had lost his dinner.

  At one period of his boyhood, Macaulay's fancy
  was much exercised by the threats and terrors of
  the law. He had a little plot of ground at the
  back of the house, marked out as his own by a row of
  oyster-shells, which a maid one day threw away as rubbish.
  He went straight to the drawing-room, where his
  mother was entertaining some visitors, walked into the
  circle, and said very solemnly: "Cursed be Sally; for it
  is written, 'Cursed is he that removeth his neighbour's
  landmark.'"

        G. O. TREVELYAN, _Life of Macaulay_.


  If care were not the waiter
    Behind a fellow's chair,
  When easy-going sinners

  And life's swift stream flows straighter--
    By Jove, it would be rare,
  If care were not the waiter
    Behind a fellow's chair.

  If wit were always radiant,

    And wine were always iced.

  [Charles] Sheridan told me that his father,
  being a good deal plagued by an old maiden
  relation of his always going out to walk with

  And, by consuming, end them? To Urn--to keep--
  No more: and while we keep, to say we end
  Contagion and the thousand graveyard ills
  That flesh is heir to--'tis a consume-ation
  Devoutly to be wished!

  _ANSWER TO AN INQUIRY._

  "_Young author._"--Yes, Agassiz _does_ recommend
  authors to eat fish, because the phosphorus
  in it makes brains. So far you are
  correct. But I cannot help you to a decision about the
  amount you need to eat--at least, not with certainty. If
  the specimen composition you send is about your fair
  usual average, I should judge that perhaps a couple of
  whales would be all you would want for the present.
  Not the largest kind, but simply good, middling-sized
  whales.

  George the Third scolded Lord North for

  Our king [William IV.] is _ultra_-popular. Have
  you heard Lord Alvanley's _bon mot_ concerning
  him? He was standing at the window at White's,
  when the king, with a thousand of his loving subjects at
  his heels, was walking up St. James's Street. A friend
  said to him, "What are you staring at, Alvanley?" "I
  am waiting to see his Majesty's pocket picked," was the
  reply.

  Hicks was talking to Thackeray of a certain
  gentleman's strange addiction to beer. "It's a
  great pity," said Hicks, "that he does not keep a
  check-rein on himself, for he is a marvellous fellow otherwise--I

  "No," retorted Thackeray, "he is a remarkable man.
  Take him for half-and-half, we ne'er shall look upon his

  One of the "Hooks and Eyes" was expatiating on

        _Machiavelli_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Romola_.


  I know not why my soul is rack'd:
    Why I ne'er smile as was my wont:
  I only know that, as a fact,
              I don't.

  I used to roam o'er glen and glade,
    Buoyant and blithe as other folk:
  And not unfrequently I made
              A joke.

  All day I sang; of love, of fame,
    Of fights our fathers fought of yore,
  Until the thing almost became
              A bore.

  I cannot sing the old songs now
    It is not that I deem them low;
  'Tis that I can't remember how
              They go.

  During [a] drive, Lord William L----, a man

  Oft when petty annoyances ruffle the soul,

  Morgan John O'Connell had the ready

  It's after a dinner at Freemason's Hall
  That the orator's talent shines brightest of all;
  When his eye becomes glazed, and his voice becomes thick,

  That his wife rather shines in the gift of the gab.

  I remember on one occasion acting in "Venice

  Wus, ever wus! By freak of Puck's
    My most exciting hopes are dashed;
  I never wore my spotless ducks

  I never roved by Cynthia's beam,
    To gaze upon the starry sky,
  But some old stiff-backed beetle came,
    And charged into my pensive eye.

  And oh! I never did the swell
    In Regent Street, amongst the beaus,
  But smuts the most prodigious fell,
    And always settled on my nose!

  It may be so--perhaps thou hast
    A warm and loving heart;
  I will not blame thee for thy face,
    Poor devil as thou art.
  That thing thou fondly deem'st a nose,
    Unsightly though it be--
  In spite of all the cold world's scorn,
    It may be much to thee.

  Those eyes--among thine elder friends
    Perhaps they pass for blue;
  No matter--if a man can see,
    What more have eyes to do?
  Thy mouth--that fissure in thy face,
    By something like a chin,
  May be a very useful place
    To put thy victuals in.

  A lovely young lady I mourn in my rhymes:
  She was pleasant, good-natured, and civil sometimes.

  "She waltzed rather well! It's a pity she's dead!"

  Some think that man from a monkey grew

  Miss Pellingle commences "Rousseau's
  Dream," with variations. Beautiful melody, by
  itself first, clear and distinct.

  Now the air tries to break out between alternate notes,
  like a prisoner behind bars. Then we have a variation
  entirely bass.

  _Happy thought._--Rousseau snoring.

  Then a scampering up, a meeting with the right
  hand, a scampering down, and a leap off one note into
  space. Then both in the middle, wobbling; then down
  into the bass again.

  _Happy thought._--Rousseau after a heavy supper.

  Sad is that woman's lot who, year by year,
  Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear,
  When Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
  Impatiently begins to "dim her eyes!"
  Compelled at last, in life's uncertain gloamings,
  To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved "combings,"
  Reduced with rouge, lip-salve, and pearly gray,
  To "make up" for lost time, as best she may!

        _Lady Jane_, in W. S. GILBERT's _Patience_.

  MY friend the late Sam Phillips one day met Douglas
  Jerrold, and told him he had seen, the day before,
  Payne Collier looking wonderfully gay and
  well--quite an evergreen. "Ah," said Jerrold, "he may
  be evergreen, but he's never _read_." On my repeating
  this to Hicks, he smiled and said, "Now that's what I
  call 'ready wit.'"

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  One day, when conversing with [a] friend, something
  was said on the subject of religious persecution,
  on which [Whately] remarked, "It is no wonder
  that some English people have a taste for persecuting on
  account of religion, since it is the first lesson that most
  are taught in their nurseries." His friend expressed his
  incredulity, and denied that _he_, at least, had been taught
  it. "Are you sure?" replied Dr. Whately. "What
  think you of this--
    'Old Daddy Longlegs _won't say his prayers_,
    Take him by the left leg, and throw him downstairs'?

  If that is not religious persecution, what is?"

        E. J. WHATELY, _Life of Whately_.

  At a fête at Hatfield House, _tableaux vivants_ were
  among the chief amusements, and scenes from
  _Ivanhoe_ were among the selections. All the
  parts were filled up but that of _Isaac of York_. Lady
  Salisbury begged Lord Alvanley "to make the set complete,
  by doing the Jew." "Anything in my power your
  ladyship may demand," replied Alvanley; "but though
  no man in England has tried oftener, I never could _do a
  Jew_ in my life."

  _THE POPE._

  Miss D., on her return to the Highlands of Scotland,
  from Rome, went to see an auld Scottish
  wife, and said, to interest the old woman, "I
  have been to Rome since I saw you--I have seen all
  sorts of great people--I have seen the Pope." The sympathetic
  old dame replied with animation, "The Pope of
  Rome!--Honest marn!--haze he ony family?"

  Nay, tempt me not, Arab, again to stay;
  Since I crave neither _Echo_ nor _Fun_ to-day,
  For thy _hand_ is not Echoless--there they are,
  _Fun_, _Glowworm_, and _Echo_, and _Evening Star_:
  And thou hintest withal that thou fain wouldst shine,
  As I con them, these bulgy old boots of mine.
  But I shrink from thee, Arab! Thou eat'st eel-pie,
  Thou evermore hast at least one black eye;
  There is brass on thy brow, and thy swarthy hues
  Are due not to nature but handling shoes;
  And the bit in thy mouth, I regret to see,
  Is a bit of tobacco-pipe--Flee, child, flee!

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  The bulk of men in our days are just as immoral as
  they were in Charles the Second's; the only
  difference is that they are incomparably more
  stupid, and that instead of decking their immorality with
  the jewels of wit, they clumsily try to cover it with the
  tarpaulin of respectability.

        _Mr. Luke_, in MALLOCK's _New Republic_.


  _WHY WIVES MAKE NO WILLS._

  Men dying make their wills, why cannot wives?
  Because wives have their wills during their lives.

        R. HUGMAN (_circa_ 1628).


  What the mischief do you suppose you want with a
  post-office at Baldwin's Ranch? It would not
  do you any good. If any letters came there,
  you couldn't read them, you know; and besides, such
  letters as ought to pass through, with money in them, for
  other localities, would not be likely to _get_ through, you
  must perceive at once; and that would make trouble for
  us all. No; don't bother about a post-office at your
  camp. What you want is a nice jail, you know--a nice,
  substantial jail, and a free school. These will be a
  lasting benefit to you. These will make you really contented
  and happy.

  Tame is Virtue's school;

  "Where are the boys of my youth?" I assure you
  this is not a conundrum. Some are amongst

  I sent the book down to the Dean, from Saunders
  and Otley's. Speaking of that firm, I don't know
  whether I told you of young Sutton, Lord
  Canterbury's son, calling there one day very angry,
  because they had not sent him some books he had
  ordered. He was, as usual, pretty warm, and so much
  so that one of the partners could bear it no longer, and
  told him as much. "I don't know who you are," was
  the answer, "but I don't want to annoy you _personally_,
  as you may not be the one in fault: it's your confounded
  house that I blame. You may be Otley, or you may be
  Saunders; if you are Saunders, d---- Otley; if you are
  Otley, d---- Saunders. I mean nothing personal _to you_."

  Of all actions of a man's life, his marriage does

  A grave and quiet man was he,
    Who loved his book and rod,--
  So even ran his line of life
    His neighbours thought it odd.

  He ne'er aspired to rank or wealth,
    Nor cared about a name,
  For though much famed for fish was he,
    He never fished for fame!

  Let others bend their necks at sight
    Of Fashion's gilded wheels,
  He ne'er had learned the art to "bob"
    For anything but eels!

  The gravest aversion exists among bears
  From rude forward persons who give themselves airs,--
  We know how some graceless young people were maul'd
  For plaguing a Prophet, and calling him _bald_.

  Strange ursine devotion! their dancing-days ended,
  Bears die to "remove" what, in life, they defended:
  They succour'd the Prophet, and, since that affair,
  The bald have a painful regard for the bear.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Heaven knows what would become of our sociality

  We had for dinner, among other things, a ham which
  was not well flavoured; and Mrs. Frederick
  Mackenzie, who was annoyed about it, began
  apologizing, and saying that Ellerton, the local grocer,
  had sold it to her as something very excellent, and as a
  genuine Westphalia. "Ah!" said Compton, "I cannot
  determine precisely whether it is east or west, but it is a
  _failure_ of some sort."

  Barry Cornwall told me that when he and

  The farmers daughter hath frank blue eyes;
    (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
  She hears the rooks caw in the windy skies,
    As she sits at her lattice and shells her peas.

  The farmer's daughter hath ripe red lips;
    (_Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese_)
  If you try to approach her, away she skips
    Over tables and chairs with apparent ease.

  The farmer's daughter hath soft brown hair;

  And I met with a ballad, I can't say where,
    Which wholly consisted of lines like these.

  Macready told a story of George B----, the
  actor, who, it seems, was not popular in the profession,

  I'm weary, and sick, and disgusted
    With Britain's mechanical din;
  Where I'm much too well known to be trusted,
    And plaguily pestered for tin;
  Where love has two eyes for your banker,
    And one chilly flame for yourself;
  Where souls can afford to be franker,
    But where they're well garnished with pelf.

  I'm sick of the whole race of poets,
    Emasculate, misty, and fine;
  They brew their small beer, and don't know its
    Distinction from full-bodied wine.
  I'm sick of the prosers, that house up
    At drowsy St. Stephen's--ain't you?
  I want some strong spirits to rouse up
    A good resolution or two!

  "On one occasion," said Brummell, "I called to
  inquire after a young lady who had sprained
  her ankle. Lewis, on being asked how she
  was, had said in the black's presence, 'The doctor has
  seen her, put her legs straight, and the poor chicken is
  doing well.' The servant, therefore, told me, with a very
  mysterious and knowing look, 'Oh, sir, the doctor has
  been here; she has laid eggs, and she and the chickens
  are doing well.'"

  A Scottish clergyman had some years since
  been cited before the Ecclesiastical Assembly
  at Edinburgh, to answer to a charge brought
  against him of great irreverence in religious matters, and
  Sir Walter [Scott] was employed by him to arrange his
  defence. The principal fact alleged against him was his
  having asserted, in a letter which was produced, that "he
  considered Pontius Pilate to be a very ill-used man, as
  he had done more for Christianity than all the other _nine
  Apostles_ put together." The fact was proved, and suspension
  followed.

  My old fellow-traveller in Germany, himself an Irishman,
  being on the box of an Irish mail-coach on
  a very cold day, and observing the driver enveloping
  his neck in the voluminous folds of an ample
  "comforter," remarked, "You seem to be taking very
  good care of yourself, my friend." "Och, to be shure I

  Dawson told a good story about the Irish landlord

  Can this be Balbus, household word for all,
  Whose earliest exploit was to build a wall:
  Who, with a frankness that I'm sure must charm ye,
  Declared it was all over with the army?
  Can this be he who feasted, as 'twas said,
  The town at forty sesterces a head?
  But, while the thankless mob his bounty quaffed,
  Historians add--that there were some who laughed.

  In Logic a woman may seldom excel;
  But in Rhetoric always she bears off the bell.
  Fair Portia will show woman's talent for law,
  When in old Shylock's bond she could prove such a flaw.
  She would blunder in physic no worse than the rest,
  She could leave things to Nature as well as the best,
  She could feel at your wrist, she could finger your fee;
  Then why should a woman not get a degree?

    With altar and reredos, with gargoyle and groin,
  The penitents' dresses are sealskin and sable,
    The odour of sanctity's eau-de-Cologne.
  But only could Lucifer, flying from Hades,
    Gaze down on this crowd with its panniers and paints,
  He would say, as he look'd at the lords and the ladies,
    "Oh, where is All Sinners', if this is All Saints'?"

  The second canto of the "Pleasures of Memory,"

  with the lines--
    "Sweet memory, wafted by thy gentle gale,

  [A] critic remarked on this passage that it suggested the
  alliteration--
    "Oft up the tide of Time I turn my _tail_."

        ROGERS, _Table Talk_.


  I like the man who makes a pun,
    Or drops a deep remark;
  I like philosophy or fun--
    A lecture or a lark;
  But I despise the men who gloat
  Inanely over anecdote.

  Ah me! I'd rather live alone
    Upon a desert isle,
  Without a voice except my own
    To cheer me all the while,
  Than dwell with men who learn by rote
  Their paltry funds of anecdote.

  The characters of great and small
    Come ready-made, we can't bespeak one;
  Their sides are many, too,--and all
    (Except ourselves) have got a weak one.
  Some sanguine people love for life,
    Some love their hobby till it flings them.--
  How many love a pretty wife
    For love of the _éclat_ she brings them!

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Conscience, in most souls, is like an English
  Sovereign--it reigns, but it does not govern.
  Its function is merely to give a formal assent to
  the Bills passed by the passions; and it knows, if it
  opposes what those are really bent upon, that ten to one
  it will be obliged to abdicate.

        _Leslie_, in MALLOCK's _New Republic_.


  If you are pious (mild form of insanity),

  We were sitting in the green-room one evening
  during the performance, chatting and laughing,
  she [Mrs. Nesbitt] having a book in her hand
  which she had to take on the stage with her in the next
  scene, when Brindal, a useful member of the company,
  but not particularly remarkable for wit or humour, came
  to the door, and, leaning against it, in a sentimental
  manner drawled out,--
    "If to her share some female errors fall,
     Look in her face----"

  He paused. She raised her beautiful eyes to him, and
  consciously smiled--_her_ smile--in anticipation of the
  well-known complimentary termination of the couplet,
  when, with a deep sigh, he added--
    "----and you'll _believe_ them all!"

  Pledge me round, I bid ye declare,
    All good fellows whose beards are grey,
  Did not the fairest of the fair
  Common grow and wearisome ere
    Ever a month was passed away?

  The reddest lips that ever have kissed,
    The brightest eyes that ever have shone,
  May pray and whisper, and we not list,
  Or look away, and never be missed,
    Ere yet ever a month is gone.

  It was known that Lord St. Jerome gave at his
  ball suppers the same champagne that he gave
  at his dinners, and that was of the highest class:
  in short, a patriot. We talk with wondering execration
  of the great poisoners of past ages, the Borgias, the
  inventor of Aqua tofana, and the amiable Marchioness
  de Brinvilliers; but Pinto was of opinion that there
  were more social poisoners about in the present day than
  in the darkest and most demoralized periods, and then
  none of them are punished; which is so strange, he
  would add, as they are all found out.

    That History is a pack of lies.
  What cause for judgment so malign?
    A brief reflection solves the mystery:
  Froude believes Kingsley a divine,
    And Kingsley goes to Froude for history.

  _Landlord_: He's only a genus.
  _Glavis_: A what?
  _Landlord_: A genus!--a man who can do everything

        LORD LYTTON, _The Lady of Lyons_.


  First love is a pretty romance,
    But not half so sweet as 'tis reckoned;
  And when one wakes from the trance,
    There's a vast stock of bliss in the second.

  And e'en should a second subside,
    A lover should never despair;
  The world is uncommonly wide,
    And the women uncommonly fair.

  The poets their raptures may tell,
    Who have never been put to the test;
  A first love is all very well,
    But, believe me, the last love's the best.

        MR. BERNAL.


  I've nothing to say again' her piety, my dear; but
  I know very well I shouldn't like her to cook
  my victual. When a man comes in hungry an'
  tired, piety won't feed him, I reckon. Hard carrots
  'ull lie heavy on his stomach, piety or no piety. It's
  right enough to be speritial--I'm no enemy to that; but
  I like my potatoes mealy.

        _Mrs. Linnet_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Janet's Repentance_.


  Somehow, sitting cosily here,

  Juxtaposition, in fine; and what is juxtaposition?
  Look you, we travel along in the railway, carriage or steamer,
  And, _pour passer le temps_, till the tedious journey be ended,
  Lay aside paper or book, to talk to the girl who is next one;
  And, _pour passer le temps_, with the terminus all but in prospect,
  Talk of eternal ties and marriages made in heaven.

  We measure the excellency of other men by some
  excellency we conceive to be in ourselves.

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  Oh! spare those Gardens where the leafy glade
  Prompts the proposal dalliance delayed;
  Where tear-dewed lids, choked utterance, sobs suppressed,
  Tear the confession from a doubting breast;
  Whence they, who vainly haunted rout and ride,
  Emerge triumphant from a suitor's side.

        ALFRED AUSTIN, _The Season_.


  They have queer hotels in Oregon. I remember
  one where they gave me a bag of oats for a

  The man who would Charybdis shun

  The flattery which is most pleasing to really beautiful
  or decidedly ugly women is that which is
  addressed to the intellect.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  Johnson's folly--to be candid--was a wild desire to treat
  Every able male white citizen he met upon the street;
  And there being several thousand--but this subject why pursue?
  'Tis with Perkins, and not Johnson, that to-day we have to do.

        BRET HARTE, _Complete Works_.


  Good little girls ought not to make mouths at
  their teachers for every trifling offence. This
  kind of retaliation should only be resorted to
  under peculiarly aggravating circumstances.

  If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust,
  while one of your more fortunate little playmates
  has a costly china one, you should treat her with a show
  of kindness nevertheless. And you ought not to attempt
  to make a forcible swap with her, unless your conscience
  would justify you in it, and you know you are able to
  do it.

  If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to
  reply that you won't. It is better and more becoming
  to intimate that you will do as she bids you, and then
  afterwards act quietly in the matter according to the
  dictates of your better judgment.

        MARK TWAIN, _Choice Works_.


  We count mankind, and keep our census still,

  Lord Andover, a very fat man, was greatly
  plagued at a fancy bazaar to buy some trifle or
  other from the ladies' stalls. At length he rather
  rudely said, "I am like the Prodigal Son, persecuted by
  ladies." "No, no," retorted Mrs. ----, "say, rather, the
  fatted calf."

  I was once as desperately in love as you are now.
  I adored, and was rejected. "You are in love
  with certain attributes," said the lady. "Damn
  your attributes, madam," said I; "I know nothing of
  attributes." "Sir," she said, with dignity, "you have
  been drinking." So we parted. She was married afterwards
  to another, who knew something about attributes,
  I suppose. I have seen her once, and only once. She
  had a baby in a yellow gown. I hate a baby in a yellow
  gown!

  How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
  And pour the waters of the Nile
    On every shining scale!

  How cheerfully he seems to grin,
    How neatly spreads his claws,
  And welcomes little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Alice in Wonderland_.


  _Apropos_ of cutlets, I once called upon an old
  lady, who pressed me so urgently to stay and
  dine with her that, as I had no engagement, I
  could not refuse. On sitting down, the servant uncovered
  a dish which contained two mutton chops; and
  my old friend said, "Mr. Hook, you see your dinner."
  "Thank you, ma'am," said I; "but where is yours?"

  Has she wedded some gigantic shrimper,
  That sweet mite with whom I loved to play?
  Is she girt with babes that whine and whimper,
  That bright being who was always gay?

  Yes--she has at least a dozen wee things!
  Yes--I see her darning corduroys,
  Scouring floors, and setting out the tea-things,
  For a howling herd of hungry boys.

  "You may report to your Government that the

  "It is an old English term for profound thinker," I
  replied.

  Woman takes the lead in all the departments,
  leaving us politics only. While we are being
  amused by the ballot, woman is quietly taking

  Would it were wind and wave alone!
  The terrors of the torrid zone,
  The indiscriminate cyclone,
                  A man might parry;
  But only faith, or "triple brass,"
  Can help the "outward-bound" to pass
  Safe through that eastward-faring class
                  Who sail to marry.

  For him fond mothers, stout and fair,
  Ascend the tortuous cabin stair
  Only to hold around his chair
                  Insidious sessions;
  For him the eyes of daughters droop
  Across the plate of handed soup,
  Suggesting seats upon the poop,
                  And soft confessions.

        AUSTIN DOBSON, _Vignettes in Rhyme_.


  It's poor work allays settin' the dead above the

        _Mrs. Poyser_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  The authoress of the "Wild Irish Girl," Lady
  Morgan, justly proud of her gifted sister Olivia,
  was in the habit of addressing every new-comer
  with, "I must make you acquainted with my Livy." She
  once used this form of words to a gentleman who had
  just been worsted in an encounter of wits with the lady
  in question. "Yes, ma'am," was the reply; "I happen
  to know your _Livy_, and I would to Heaven your _Livy_
  was _Tacitus_."

        LORD ALBEMARLE, _Fifty Years of my Life._


  "Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed,"
    Observes some solemn, sentimental owl;
  Maxims like these are very cheaply said;
    But e'er you make yourself a fool or fowl,
  Pray just inquire about his rise and fall,
  And whether larks have any bed at all!

  The "time for honest folks to be in bed"
    Is in the morning, if I reason right;
  And he who cannot keep his precious head
    Upon its pillow till it's fairly light,
  And so enjoy his forty morning winks,
  Is up to knavery; or else--he drinks!

  We can't for a certainty tell
    What mirth may molest us on Monday;
  But, at least, to begin the week well,
    Let us all be unhappy on Sunday.

  These gardens, their walks and green bowers,
    Might be free to the poor man for one day;
  But no, the glad plants and gay flowers
    Mustn't bloom or smell sweetly on Sunday.

  Abroad we forbid folks to roam
    For fear they get social or frisky;
  But of course they can sit still at home,
    And get dismally drunk upon whiskey.

  To Matthew Arnold we must go to put us in the right, sir,
  About his elevating scheme of "sweetness" and of "light," sir,

  No man can be wise on an empty stomach.

  All tragedies are finished by a death,
    All comedies are ended by a marriage;
  The future states of both are left to faith,

  The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath.

  The Bailli de Ferrette was always dressed in knee-breeches,

  Montrond one day, "have you got three legs or three
  swords?"

  A Mexican lady's hair never curls--it's as straight

  I've read the poets of our land,
    Who sing of beauty and of love,
  Who rave about a dimpled hand,
    And write sweet sonnets on a glove.
  But sweeter far than maiden's kiss,
    And fairer far than Jouvin's best,
  Is one red-labelled quart, I wis,
    With Bass's well-known mark imprest.

  And years may come, and years may go,
    And fortune change as fortune will,
  But may my Burton fountain flow,
    In shade and sunshine clearly still,
  And till life's night is closing grey,
    My heart shall ever hold most dear
  The liquor that I sing to-day--
    My childhood's friend! my Bass's beer!

        H. SAVILE CLARKE.


  Women are much more like each other than men;
  they have, in truth, but two passions: vanity and
  love: these are their universal characteristics.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  "After all, are not women necessary to your
  happiness?"

  "Alas!" sighed Maximilian, "it is but too
  true. But women have unfortunately only one way of
  making us happy, whilst they have thirty thousand
  different modes of rendering us miserable."

        HEINRICH HEINE, _The Florentine Nights_.


  I love you! ay! it seems absurd,
    Altho' to prove it I was sedulous;
  The _ink_ is _black_ that writes the word,
    Yet you will read it all _inc-red_-ulous.
  Where was my sense, once so acute,
    To dream myself a hopeful suitor?
  I should have been much more _astute_;
    I came to you, you know, _as tutor_!
  My passion on an instant grew--
    (Spontaneous love is scarce a crime!).
  How swift those early minutes flew!
    And, _odd_ to say, 'twas _even_-time!
  Maddened with love, I penned a note,
    And placed it where 'twould catch your sight;
  Alas for me! but when I _wrote_,
  Of course I thought that I _did right_!

        ROBERT REECE, in _Comic Poets_.


  The most dreadful thing against women is the

  There's one Thomas Buckle, a London youth,
      Who taught that the world was blind
      Till he was born to proclaim the truth,
  That matter is moulder of mind;
    But I really can't fancy at all
      How wheat, rice, and barley,
      Made Dick, Tom, and Charlie
        So tidy and trim,
        Without help from Him
    Who was preached both by Plato and Paul.

        J. S. BLACKIE, _Musa Burschicosa_.


  Sheridan's answer to Lord Lauderdale was excellent,
  on the latter saying he would repeat
  some good thing I had mentioned to him:
  "Pray don't, my dear Lauderdale; a joke in your mouth

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  Do you know why the rabbits are caught in the snare,
    Or the tabby cat's shot on the tiles?
  Why the tigers and lions creep out of their lair?
    Why an ostrich will travel for miles?
  Do you know why a sane man will whimper and cry,
    And weep o'er a ribbon or glove?
  Why a cook will put sugar for salt in a pie?
    Do you know? Well, I'll tell you--it's Love.

        _Flapper_, in H. P. STEPHENS's _Billee Taylor_.


  I remember Curran once--in an action for
  breach of promise of marriage, in which he was
  counsel for the defendant, a young clergyman--thus
  appealing to the jury: "Gentlemen, I entreat of
  you not to ruin this young man by a vindictive verdict,
  for though he has talents, and is in the Church, he may
  rise!"

  I heard an anecdote at Oxford, of a porter encountering
  on his rounds two undergraduates,
  who were without their gowns, or out of bounds,
  or out of hours. He challenged one: "Your name and
  college?" They were given. Turning to the other: "And
  pray, sir, what might your name be?" "Julius Cæsar,"
  was the reply. "What, sir, do you mean to say your
  name is Julius Cæsar?" "Sir, you did not ask me what
  it is, but what it _might_ be."

        MISS MITFORD, _Life and Letters_.


  I never nursed a dear gazelle;
    But I was given a parroquet--
  (How I did nurse him if unwell!)
    He's imbecile, but lingers yet.
  He's green, with an enchanting tuft;
    He melts me with his small black eye;
  He'd look inimitable stuff'd,
    And knows it--but he will not die!

  _A SUITABLE BRIDE._

  My friend Admiral E. E., shortly after his return
  from a cruise, met an old acquaintance in the
  streets of ----, who said, after the usual salutations
  had passed, "They telt me, Admiral, that ye had
  got married." The Admiral, hoping for a compliment,
  replied, "Why, Bailie, I am getting on; I'm not so young
  as I was, you see, and none of the girls will have me."
  On which the Bailie, with perfect good faith and simplicity,
  replied, "'Deed, Admiral, I was na evenin' yer to
  a lassie, but there's mony a fine, respeckit, _half-worn_
  wumman wad be glad to tak ye."

          And I whispered, "I guess
            The sweet secret thou keepest,
          And the dainty distress
            That thou wistfully weepest;
  And the question is, 'Licence or banns?' though undoubtedly
    banns are the cheapest."

          Then her white hand I clasped,
            And with kisses I crowned it.
          But she glared and she gasped,
            And she muttered, "Confound it!"
  Or at least it was something like that, but the noise of
    the omnibus drowned it.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Phantasmagoria_.


  It was Lady Cork who had originated the idea that,

  When Tennyson entered the Oxford Theatre to

  "Ha! ha!" he said, "you loathe your ways,
    You writhe at these my words of warning,
  In agony your hands you raise!"

  "Ho! ho!" he cries, "you bow your crests--
    My eloquence has set you weeping;
  In shame you bend upon your breasts!"

  While spending an evening at [Mendelssohn's]

  Job, wanting a partner, thought he'd be blest,
  If, of all womankind, he selected the Best;
  For, said he, of all evils that compass the globe,
  A bad wife would most try the patience of Job.
  The Best, then, he chose, and made bone of his bone,
  Though 'twas clear to his friends she'd be Best left alone;
  For, though Best of her sex, she's the weakest of all,
  If it's true that the weakest must go to the Wall.

        HICKS, _apud_ J. C. YOUNG.


  La vertu des femmes est peut-être une question du
  tempérament.

  _ON ONE STEALING A POUND OF CANDLES._

  Light-fingered Catch, to keep his hands in ure,
  Stole anything,--of this you may be sure,
  That he thinks all his own that once he handles,--
  For practice' sake did steal a pound of candles;
  Was taken in the act:--oh, foolish wight!
  To steal such things as needs must come to light!

        _A Collection of Epigrams_ (1727).


  At Hook's, one day the conversation turned on the
  Duke of Cumberland, and a question asked who
  he married. "Don't you know?" said Cannon;
  "the Princess de _Psalms_ (Salms),--good enough for
  _Hymn_ (him)."

        W. JERDAN, _Memoirs_.


  For me, I neither know nor care
  Whether a parson ought to wear
    A black dress or a white dress;
  Fill'd with a trouble of my own--
  A wife who preaches in her gown,
    And lectures in her night-dress!

        THOMAS HOOD.


  Madame de ---- having said, in her intense
  style, "I should like to be married in _English_,
  in a language in which vows are so faithfully
  kept," some one asked Frere, "What language, I wonder,
  was _she_ married in?" "_Broken_ English, I suppose," answered
  Frere.

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  Your magpies and stock-doves may flirt among trees,
  And chatter their transports in groves, if they please;
  But a house is much more to my taste than a tree,
  And for groves, O! a good grove of chimneys for me.

        CHARLES MORRIS, _Lyra Urbanica_.


  Again they asked me to marry them, and again I
  declined, when they cried,--"Oh, cruel man!
  This is too much--too much!" I told them
  that it was on account of the muchness that I declined.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  On one of the country gentlemen saying in Parliament,
  "We must return to the food of our ancestors,"
  somebody asked, "What food does he
  mean?" "Thistles, I suppose," said Tierney.

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  Maidens then were innocent,
  Blushing at a compliment,
                    Or a gaze.
  But a blush a vanish'd grace is,
  For young ladies paint their faces
                    Now-a-days,

  Black their eyelids till they stare,
  Wash with soda, till their hair
                    Looks like maize;
  'Tis the fashion to be blonde
  _À la mode du demi-monde_
                    Now-a-days.

        J. JEMMETT BROWNE, _Songs of Many Seasons_.


  [Lady Charlotte Lindsay] said she had
  "sprained her ankle so often, and been told
  that it was worse than breaking her leg, that
  she said she had come to look upon a broken leg as a
  positive advantage."

  Blows are sarcasms turned stupid.

        GEORGE ELIOT, _Felix Holt_.


  They grieved for those who perished with the cutter,
  And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.

        LORD BYRON, _Don Juan_.


  Social arrangements are awful miscarriages;
  Cause of all crime is our system of marriages.
      Poets with sonnets, and lovers with trysts,
      Kindle the ire of the Positivists.

  Husbands and wives should be all one community:
  Exquisite freedom with absolute unity.
      Wedding-rings worse are than manacled wrists--
      Such is the creed of the Positivists.

        MORTIMER COLLINS, _The British Birds_.


  Fox, whose pecuniary embarrassments were universally
  recognized, being attacked by a severe
  indisposition, which confined him to his apartment,
  Dudley frequently visited him. In the course of
  conversation, Fox, alluding to his complaints, remarked
  that he was compelled to observe much regularity in his
  diet and hours; adding, "I live by rule, like clockwork."
  "Yes," replied Dudley; "I suppose you mean you go
  by _tick, tick, tick_."

  _PROBATUM EST._

  One loss has a companion always. _Semper_,
  When people lose their train, they lose their temper.

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  Working by the hour tends to make one moral.
  A plumber working by the job, trying to unscrew
  a rusty, refractory nut, in a cramped position, where
  the tongs continually slipped off, would swear; but I
  never heard one of them swear, or exhibit the least
  impatience at such a vexation, working by the hour.
  Nothing can move a man who is paid by the hour. How
  sweet the flight of time seems to his calm mind!

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  It greets me in my festal hours,
    It brings my gloom relief;
  It sprinkles life with loveliest flowers
    And plucks the sting from grief.
  I'd smile at poverty and pain;
    I'd welcome death with glee--
  If to the last I might retain
    My own--my upper G!

        H. S. LEIGH, _Carols of Cockayne_.


  "Milton Perkins," said the Siren, "not thy wealth do I admire,
  But the intellect that flashes from those eyes of opal fire;
  And methinks the name thou bearest cannot surely be misplaced;
  And--embrace me, Mister Perkins!" Milton Perkins her embraced.

        BRET HARTE, _Complete Works_.


  Truth-vendors and medicine-vendors usually
  recommend swallowing. When a man sees his
  livelihood in a pill or a proposition, he likes to
  have orders for the dose, and not curious inquiries.

       _Felix Holt_, in GEORGE ELIOT's novel.


  Stuart Mill on Mind and Matter
    All our old Beliefs would scatter:
  Stuart Mill exerts his skill
    To make an end of Mind and Matter.

  But had I skill, like Stuart Mill,
    His own position I could shatter:
  The weight of Mill I count as Nil--
    If Mill has neither Mind nor Matter.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.


  "And how many hours a day did you do lessons?"
  said Alice.
  "Ten hours the first day," said the Mock
  Turtle; "nine the next, and so on."
  "What a curious plan!" exclaimed Alice.
  "That's the reason they're called lessons," the Gryphon
  remarked "because they lessen from day to day."

  I want you to come and pass sentence
    On two or three books with a plot;
  Of course you know "Janet's Repentance"?
    I'm reading Sir _Waverley_ Scott,
  The story of Edgar and Lucy,
    How thrilling, romantic, and true!
  The Master (his bride was a _goosey_!)
          Reminds me of you.

  They tell me Cockayne has been crowning
    A poet whose garland endures:
  It was you who first spouted me Browning--
    That stupid old Browning of yours!
  His vogue and his verve are alarming;
    I'm anxious to give him his due,
  But, Fred, he's not nearly so charming
          A poet as you!

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Joseph Gillon was a Writer to the Signet. Calling
  on him one day in his writing office, Sir Walter
  Scott said, "Why, Joseph, this place is as hot as
  an oven." "Well," quoth Gillon, "and isn't it here that
  I make my bread?"

        LOCKHART, _Life of Scott_.


  Forever! 'tis a single word!
    Our rude forefathers deem'd it two;
  Can you imagine so absurd
              A view?
  Forever! what abysms of woe
    The word reveals, what frenzy, what
  Despair! For ever (printed so)
              Did not.
  And nevermore must printer do
    As men did longago; but run
  "For" into "ever," bidding two
              Be one.
  Forever! passion-fraught, it throws
    O'er the dim page a gloom, a glamour:
  It's sweet, it's strange, and I suppose
              It's grammar.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  Walking down St. James's Street, Lord Chelmsford
  was accosted by a stranger, who exclaimed,
  "Mr. Birch, I believe?" "If you believe that,
  sir, you'll believe anything," replied the ex-chancellor, as
  he passed on.

        BERKELEY, _Life and Recollections_.


  You snared me, Rose, with ribbons,
    Your rose-mouth made me thrall.
  Brief--briefer far than Gibbon's,
    Was my "Decline and Fall."

        AUSTIN DOBSON, _Vignettes in Rhyme_.


  The reason we dislike vanity in others is because
  it is perpetually hurting our own.

  Then nymphs had bluer eyes than hose,
  England then measured men by blows,
    And measured time by candles.

  A woman's choice usually means taking the only
  man she can get.

        _Mrs. Cadwallader_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Middlemarch_.


  To charm the girls he never spoke--
    Although his voice was fine;
  He found the most convenient way
    Was just to drop a line.

  And many a gudgeon of the pond,
    If they could speak to-day,
  Would own, with grief, this angler had
    A mighty "taking" way.

        JOHN GODFREY SAXE, _Poems_.


  I am always afraid of a fool: one cannot be sure
  that he is not a knave as well.

        W. HAZLITT, _Characteristics_.


  The people is much given to stoning its prophets
  that it may worship their reliques with the greater
  fervency: dogs that bark at us to-day lick our
  bones to-morrow with true canine fidelity.

        HEINRICH HEINE, _Ludwig Beorne_.


  Money makes a man laugh. A blind fiddler
  playing to a company, and playing but scurvily,
  the company laughed at him. His boy that led
  him, perceiving it, cried, "Father, let us begone; they
  do nothing but laugh at you." "Hold peace, boy," said
  the fiddler; "we shall have their money presently, and
  then we will laugh at them."

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  In candent ire the solar splendour flames;
  The foles, languescent, pend from arid rames;
  His humid front the cive, anheling, wipes,
  And dreams of erring on ventiferous ripes.

  How dulce to vive occult from mortal eyes,
  Dorm on the herb with none to supervise,
  Carp the suave berries from the crescent vine,
  And bibe the flow from longicaudate kine!

  Me wretched! Let me curr to quercine shades!
  Effund your albid hausts, lactiferous maids!
  Oh, might I vole to some umbrageous clump,--
  Depart--be off--exude--evade--erump!

        OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.


  He slaps me gently on the back. He's stopped too
  long in the wine-cellar. A little tasting is a
  dangerous thing.

        F. C. BURNAND, _Happy Thoughts_.


  _THE MAIDENS._

  Lovers, we pray you, gaining our consents,
  Let us, too, have _our_ mediæval bents;
  Give us, for cricket matches, tournaments.


  _THE WIDOWERS._

  We are stout, nor will uncomfortably truss
  Our arms and legs, like fowls; no jousts for us;
  In armour we should look ridiculous.


  _THE FATHERS._

  Of money, tournaments would cost a heap;
  Humour your sweethearts, sons, with something cheap;
  But look to settlements before you leap.

        _Once a Week._


  He [Samuel Beazley] suffered considerably a short
  time before his decease, and, his usual spirits
  occasionally forsaking him, he one day wrote
  so melancholy a letter that the friend to whom it was
  addressed, observed, in his reply, that it was "like the
  first chapter of Jeremiah." "You are mistaken, my
  dear fellow," retorted the wit; "it is the last chapter of
  Samuel."

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  No one can perceive, as I'm a sinner,
  A very marked improvement in the dinner.
  We still consume, with mingled shame and grief,
  Veal that is tottering on the verge of beef,
  Veal void of stuffing, widowed of its ham,
  Or the roast shoulder of an ancient ram.

        _Decius Mus_, in G. O. TREVELYAN's _Horace at Athens_.


  "As for that," said Waldershare, "sensible men are

  "Sensible men never tell."

  _ON AN OLD LOVE._

  Upon the cabin stairs we met, the voyage nearly over;
  You leant upon his arm, my pet, from Calais unto Dover!
  And _he_ is looking very glad, tho' I am feeling sadder,
  That _I'm_ not your companion-lad on that companion-ladder!

        J. ASHBY STERRY, in _English Epigrams_.


  It strikes me that one mother-in-law is about
  enough to have in a family--unless you're very
  fond of excitement.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  "Come here, my boy, hould up your head,
    And look like a jintleman, sir;
  Jist tell me who King Jonah was;
    Now tell me, if you can, sir."
  "King Jonah was the strongest man
    That ever wore a crown, sir;
  For though the whale did swallow him,
    It couldn't keep him down, sir."

  "You're right, my boy, hould up your head,
    And look like a jintleman, sir;
  Just tell me who that Moses was;
    Now tell me, if you can, sir."
  "Shure Moses was the Christian name
    Of good King Pharaoh's daughter;
  She was a milkmaid, and she took
    A _profit_ from the water."

        J. A. SIDEY, _Mistura Curiosa_.


  A little incident Charlotte Cushman once related
  to me. She said a man in the gallery of
  a theatre made such a disturbance that the play
  could not proceed. Cries of "Throw him over" arose
  from all parts of the house, and the noise became furious.
  All was tumultuous above until a sweet and gentle female
  voice was heard in the pit, exclaiming, "No! I pray
  you, don't throw him over! I beg of you, dear friends,
  don't throw him over, but--_kill him where he is_."

        J. T. FIELDS, _Yesterdays with Authors_.


  With all his conscience and one eye askew,
  So false, he partly took himself for true;
  Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry,
  Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye;
  Who, never naming God except for gain,
  So never took that useful name in vain;
  Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,
  And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool;
  Nor deeds of gift, but deeds of grace he forged,
  And snake-like slimed his victim ere he gorged;
  And oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest
  Arising, did his holy oily best,
  Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven,
  To spread the Word by which himself had thriven.

        ALFRED TENNYSON, _Sea Dreams_.


  Please the eyes and the ears, they will introduce
  you to the heart, and, nine times in ten,
  the heart governs the understanding.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  The cup with trembling hands he grasps,
  Close to his thirsty lips he clasps,
  Ringed with its pewter rim--he gasps.

  The eddying floor beneath him crawls,
  He clutches at the flying walls,
  Then like a lump of lead he falls.

  There's a joy without canker or cark,
    There's a pleasure eternally new,
  'Tis to gloat on the glaze and the mark
    Of china that's ancient and blue;
  Unchipp'd all the centuries through
    It has pass'd, since the chime of it rang,
  And they fashion'd it, figure and hue,
    In the reign of the Emperor Hwang.

  [Dr. Busby] was once invited, during a residence at
  Deal, by an old Westminster--who, from being
  a very idle, well-flogged boy, had, after a course
  of distinguished service, been named to the command
  of a fine frigate in the Downs--to visit him on board
  his ship. The doctor accepted the invitation; and,
  after he had got up the ship's side, the captain piped all
  hands for punishment, and said to the astonished doctor,
  "You d--d old scoundrel, I am delighted to have the
  opportunity of paying you off at last. Here, boatswain,
  give him three dozen."

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  _GOOD AND BAD LUCK._

  Good Luck is the gayest of all gay girls;
    Long in one place she will not stay:
  Back from your brow she strokes the curls,
    Kisses you quick and flies away.

  But Madame Bad Luck soberly comes
    And stays--no fancy has she for flitting--
  Snatches of true-love songs she hums,
    And sits by your bed, and brings her knitting.

        JOHN HAY, _Poems_.


  I wish nine-tenths of the pictures that have been

  For "Union" one, "No Union" t'other cries.
  Shame on the sex that such dispute began--
  Ladies are all for union--to a man!

  Why, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding,
  nagging woman. They go on with the same
  thing over and over again, and never come to a
  reasonable end. Anybody 'ud think the Scotch tunes
  had always been asking a question of somebody as deaf
  as old Taft, and had never got an answer yet.

  _SOUL OF LADY._

  Tell me, in this night of snow,
  Of happy Almack's, or the Row!
  Say in what carriages what fair
  Consume the ice in Berkeley Square;
  Or who in shops, with doubtful eye,
  Explore the silks they never buy;
  And how the hair is dressed in town,
  And what the shape of boot and gown?


  _WINDBAG._

  Snow-mantled shadow, would you know
  The fashions of the world below?
  Still the coiled chignon starward towers,
  Still false back-hair falls down in showers;
  But now all subtle souls revert
  To the abbreviated skirt,
  Whose velvet _paniers_ just denote
  The gown, that else were petticoat.
  Nor is such _naïve_ attire enough:
  Elizabeth's archaic ruff
  Rings every neck; besides, they rival,
  With a High-Gothic-Hat-Revival,
  Old Mother Hubbard, and renew
  Arcadianly the buckled shoe,
  To show, what's just a trifle shocking,
  The dimple of a snowy stocking.

  _DON'T WE?_

  We're informed that, in Happy Japan,
  Folks are free to believe what they can;

  They go off to gaol in a van.
  Don't you wish _this_ was Happy Japan?

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  I hope I appreciate the value of children. We
  should soon come to nothing without them.
  Without them the common school would languish.
  But the problem is, what to do with them in a
  garden. For they are not good to eat, and there is a law
  against making away with them. The law is not very
  well enforced, it is true; for people do thin them out
  with constant dosing, paregoric, and soothing-syrups, and
  scanty clothing. But I, for one, feel it would not be
  right, aside from the law, to take the life, even of the
  smallest child, for the sake of a little fruit, more or less,
  in the garden. I may be wrong; but these are my sentiments,
  and I am not ashamed of them.

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  _ON DR. TRAPP'S TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL._

  Mind but thy preaching, Trapp; translate no further:

  Shortly before his death, being visited by a
  clergyman whose features as well as language

  _ON GRAPES AND GRIPES._

  In Spain, that land of monks and apes,

  The thing called gripes doth come from wine.

  Of Diggle, Barham used to tell many absurd stories.
  The most amusing of his practical jokes was one
  in which Barham had a share. The two boys
  having, in the course of one of their walks, discovered a
  Quakers' meeting-house, forthwith procured a penny tart
  of a neighbouring pastry-cook; furnished with this,
  Diggle marched boldly into the building, and, holding up
  the delicacy in the midst of the grave assembly, said with
  perfect solemnity, "Whoever speaks first shall have this
  pie." "Friend, go thy way," commenced a drab-coloured
  gentleman, rising, "go thy way, and----" "The pie's
  yours, sir!" exclaimed Master Diggle, politely, and
  placing it before the astounded speaker, hastily effected
  his escape.

  Talking of some poor relations who had been

  By Moorish damsel it was pluck'd,
    Beneath the golden day there;
  By swain 'twas then in London suck'd--
    Who flung the peel away there.

  He could not know in Pimlico,
    As little she in Seville,
  That _I_ should reel upon that peel,
    And--wish them at the devil.

  _ON THE PRINCE REGENT'S ILLNESS._

  The Regent, sir, is taken ill;
  And all depends on Halford's skill;
  "Pray what," inquired the sage physician,
  "Has brought him to this sad condition?"
  When Bloomfield ventured to pronounce,
  "A little too much Cherry Bounce,"
  The Regent, hearing what was said,
  Raised from his couch his aching head,
  And cried, "No, Halford, 'tis not so!
  _Cure us, O_ doctor,--_Curaçoa!_"

  Brigham Young has two hundred wives. He
  loves not wisely, but two hundred well. He's
  dreadfully married. He's the most married man
  I ever saw in my life. He says that all he wants now is
  to live in peace for the remainder of his days, and have
  his dying pillow soothed by the loving hands of his
  family. Well, that's all right, I suppose; but if all his
  family soothe his dying pillow, he'll have to go out-doors
  to die.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  And I said, "What is written, sweet sister,
    At the opposite end of the room?"
  She sobbed, as she answered, "All liquors
    Must be paid for ere leaving the room."

  Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not
  tell them so.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  The Walrus and the Carpenter
    Were walking close at hand;
  They wept like anything to see
    Such quantities of sand:
  "If this were only cleared away,"
    They said, "It _would_ be grand!"

  "If seven maids, with seven mops,
    Swept it for half a year,
  Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
    "That they could get it clear?"
  "I doubt it;" said the Carpenter,
    And shed a bitter tear.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Through the Looking-Glass_.


  We easily convert our own vices into other people's
  virtues, the virtues of others into vices.

        W. HAZLITT, _Characteristics_.


  You'd better keep clear of love-letters,
      Or write them with caution and care;
      In faith, they may fasten your fetters,
    If wearing a conjugal air.

  Against stupidity the gods themselves combat in
  vain.

        HEINRICH HEINE, _Art Notes from Paris_.


  _ON LOVE AND MARRIAGE._

  'Tis highly rational, we can't dispute,
  That Love, being naked, should promote a suit;
  But doth not oddity to him attach
  Whose fire's so oft extinguished by a match?

        R. GARNETT, _Idylls and Epigrams_.


  Lord Shelburne could say the most provoking
  things, and yet appear unconscious of
  their being so. In one of his speeches, alluding
  to Lord Carlisle, he said, "The noble lord has written
  a comedy." "No, a tragedy." "Oh, I beg pardon, I
  thought it was a comedy."

        ROGERS, _Table Talk_.


  There's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
  As rum and true religion.

  She never speaks to any one, which is of course a
  great advantage to any one.

        LADY ASHBURTON, _apud_ LORD HOUGHTON.


  I'm not denyin' the women are foolish: God Almighty
  made 'em to match the men.

        _Mrs. Poyser_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  "You didn't know I drew? I learnt at school."
  "Perhaps you only learnt to draw your sword?"
  "Why, that I can, of course--and also corks--
  And covers--haw! haw! haw! But what I mean,
  Fortification--haw!--in Indian ink,
  That sort of thing--and though I draw it mild,
  Yet that--haw! haw!--that may be called my _forte_."
  "Oh fie! for shame! where do you think you'll go
  For making such a heap of foolish puns?"
  "Why, to the Punjaub, I should think--haw! haw!
  That sort of job, you know, would suit me best."

  _ON THE HOUSE OF COMMONS_.

  When lately Pym descended into Hell,
    Ere he the cups of Lethè did carouse,
  What place that was, he callèd loud to tell;
    To whom a Devil--"This is the Lower House."

        WILLIAM DRUMMOND (1585-1649).


  The working-man is a noble creature--when he is
  quite sober.

        _Alexis_, in W. S. GILBERT's _Sorcerer_.


  _DEFENDANT'S SONG._

  When first my old, old love I knew,
    My bosom swelled with joy;
  My riches at her feet I threw,--
    I was a love-sick boy!
  No terms seemed too extravagant
    Upon her to employ--
  I used to mope, and sigh, and pant,
    Just like a love-sick boy!

  But joy incessant palls the sense,
    And love, unchanged, will cloy,
  And she became a bore intense
    Unto her love-sick boy!
  With fitful glimmer burnt my flame,
    And I grew cold and coy,
  At last, one morning, I became
    Another's love-sick boy!

        W. S. GILBERT, _Trial by Jury_.


  Dining one day where the host became exceedingly
  excited and angry at not being able to
  find any stuffing in a roasted leg of pork, Poole
  quietly suggested, "Perhaps it is in the other leg?"

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  In 1848, Feargus O'Connor was charged in the
  House with being a republican. He denied it,
  and said he did not care whether the Queen or
  the Devil was on the throne. Peel replied: "When the
  honourable gentleman sees the sovereign of his choice on
  the throne of these realms, I hope he'll enjoy, and I'm
  sure he'll deserve, the confidence of the Crown."

        ABRAHAM HAYWARD, _Essays_.


  I loiter down by thorp and town;
    For any job I'm willing;
  Take here and there a dusty brown,
    And here and there a shilling.

  I deal in every ware in turn,
    I've rings for buddin' Sally,
  That sparkle like those eyes of her'n;
    I've liquor for the valet.

  The things I've done 'neath moon and stars
    Have got me into messes;
  I've seen the sky through prison bars,
    I've torn up prison dresses.

  But out again I come, and show
    My face, nor care a stiver;
  For trades are brisk and trades are slow,
    But mine goes on for ever.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  They may talk of the devotion of the sex, but the
  most faithful attachment in life is that of a
  woman in love--with herself.

        _Damas_, in LORD LYTTON's _Lady of Lyons_.


  They may talk as they please about what they call pelf,
  And how one ought never to think of one's self,
  And how pleasures of thought surpass eating and drinking--
  My pleasure of thought is the pleasure of thinking
    How pleasant it is to have money, heigh ho!
    How pleasant it is to have money!

        _Spirit_, in A. H. CLOUGH's _Dipsychus_.


  Women are generally consistent in their insincerity,

  The profession's already so full

  Eye-glass--a toy which enables a coxcomb to
  see others, and others to see that he is a
  coxcomb.

        HORACE SMITH, _The Tin Trumpet_.


  Some brag of telegraphs and rails,
  Coals, steam, and gas, and a' that,
  But rattling mails and cotton bales
  Ne'er made a man for a' that;
    For a' that, and a' that,
    Their figures, facts, and a' that,
    The first of facts is Thought, and what
    High Thought begets, for a' that!

        J. S. BLACKIE, _Musa Burschicosa_.


  Virginia city--the wild young metropolis of the
  new Silver State. Fortunes are made there in
  a day. There are instances on record of young
  men going to this place without a shilling--poor and
  friendless--yet by energy, intelligence, and a careful
  disregard to business, they have been enabled to leave
  there, owing hundreds of pounds.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  Nothing is accounted so proper in England as
  property.

        _Guesses at Truth._


  As the husband is, the wife is,--he is stomach-plagued and old;
  And his curry soups will make thy cheek the colour of his gold.

  When his feeble love is sated, he will hold thee surely then
  Something lower than his hookah,--something less than his cayenne.

  What is this? His eyes are pinky. Was't the claret? Oh, no, no--
  Bless your soul! it was the salmon--salmon always makes him so.

        _Bon Gaultier Ballads._


  A clergyman had commenced an able discourse,
  when one of the hearers exclaimed,
  "That's Tillotson!" This was allowed to pass;
  but very soon another exclamation followed, "That's
  Paley." The preacher then addressed the disturber: "I
  tell you, sir, if there is to be a repetition of such conduct,
  I shall call on the churchwarden to have you removed
  from the church." "That's your own," was the ready
  reply.

        MARK BOYD, _Reminiscences_.


  College mostly makes people like bladders--just
  good for nothing but t' hold the stuff as is poured
  into 'em.

        _Bartle Massey_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  Werther had a love for Charlotte
    Such as words could never utter;
  Would you know how first he met her?
    She was cutting bread and butter.

  So he sighed and pined and ogled,
    And his passion boiled and bubbled,
  Till he blew his silly brains out,
    And no more was by it troubled.

  Charlotte, having seen his body
    Borne before her on a shutter,
  Like a well-conducted person,
    Went on cutting bread and butter.

        W. M. THACKERAY.


  Perhaps the best illustration I can give of
  [Bagehot's] more sardonic humour, was his
  remark to a friend who had a church on the
  grounds near his house:--"Ah, you've got the church
  in the grounds! I like that. It's well the tenants
  shouldn't be _quite_ sure that the landlord's power stops
  with this world."

  _ON WIVES._

  All wives are bad,--yet two blest hours they give,

  "Yes, my dear curate," said the Professor, "what
  I am enjoying is the champagne that you
  drink, and what you are enjoying is the champagne
  that I drink. This is altruism; this is benevolence;
  this is the sublime outcome of enlightened
  modern thought. The pleasures of the table, in themselves,
  are low and beastly ones; but if we each of us
  are only glad because the others are enjoying them, they
  become holy and glorious beyond description."

  "They do," cried the curate rapturously, "indeed they
  do. I will drink another bottle for your sake."

        W. H. MALLOCK, _The New Paul and Virginia_.


  Some d--d people have come in, and I must stop.

        LAMB to WORDSWORTH.


  Ours is so far-advanced an age!
  Sensation-tales, a classic stage,
                    Commodious villas!
  We boast high art, an Albert Hall,
  Australian meats, and men who call
                    Their sires gorillas!

        AUSTIN DOBSON, _Vignettes in Rhyme_.


  It being asked at Paris whom they would have as

  Before the blast are driven the flying clouds--
    (And I should like to blow a cloud as well,)
  The vapours wrap the mountain-tops in shrouds--
    (I left my mild cheroots at the hotel.)
  Dotting the glassy surface of the stream,
    (Oh, here's a cigarette--my mind's at ease.)
  The boats move silently, as in a dream--
    (Confound it! where on earth are my fusees?)

  Emile de Girardin, the famous political writer, a

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine--
    A sad, sour, sober beverage,--by time
  Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour,
    Down to a very homely household savour.

        LORD BYRON, _Don Juan_.


  Lettuce is like conversation; it must be fresh,
  and crisp, so sparkling that you scarcely notice
  the bitter in it. Lettuce, like conversation,
  requires a good deal of oil, to avoid friction, and
  keep the company smooth; a pinch of attic salt; a
  dash of pepper; a quantity of mustard and vinegar, by
  all means, but so mixed that you will notice no sharp
  contrasts; and a trifle of sugar.

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  _MARTIAL IN LONDON._

  Exquisite wine and comestibles
  From Slater, and Fortnum and Mason;
  Billiards, écarté, and chess-tables;
  Water in vast marble basin;
  Luminous books (not voluminous)
  To read under beech-trees cacuminous;
  One friend, who is fond of a distich,
  And doesn't get too syllogistic;
  A valet who knows the complete art
  Of service--a maiden, his sweetheart;--
  Give me these, in some rural pavilion,
  And I'll envy no Rothschild his million.

        MORTIMER COLLINS, in _The Owl_.


  He was much too disliked not to be sought after.
  Whatever is once notorious, even for being

  _TO GIBBS, CONCERNING HIS POEMS._

  You ask me if I think your poems good;
  If I could praise your poems, Gibbs,--I would.

        EGERTON WEBBE, _apud_ LEIGH HUNT.


  What I admire in the order to which you belong
  [the aristocracy], is that they do live in the air,
  that they excel in athletic sports; that they can
  only speak one language; and that they never read.
  This is not a complete education, but it is the highest
  education since the Greek.

        _Phoebus_, in LORD BEACONSFIELD's _Lothair_.


  _RELIABLE._

  (A MILD PROTEST.)

  Shut up a party who uses "Reliable"
  When he means "Trustworthy;" 'tis undeniable
  That his excuses are flimsy and friable,
  And his conceptions of grammar most pliable.
  No doubt he'd pronounce this line's last word "enviable:"
  Invent, for bad fish (which he'd sell) the word "criable,"
  Say that his faded silk hat might be dyeable,
  And accent French vilely--allude to _le diable_.
  If his name's William, 'twould be most enj'yable
  To see Mr. Calcraft preparing to tie a Bill.
  Now let Punch hope he has stamped out "Reliable."

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  "I see," said my clerical neighbour, addressing
  myself, "you stick to port." "Yes," I said,
  "and so am safe from being half-seas over."

        W. H. HARRISON, _Reminiscences_.


  All tradesmen cry up their own wares:
    In this they agree well together:
  The Mason by stone and lime swears;
    The Tanner is always for leather;
  The Smith still for iron would go;
    The Schoolmaster stands up for teaching;
  And the Parson would have you to know
    There's nothing on earth like his preaching.

  Matrimony--the high sea for which no compass
  has yet been invented.

        HEINRICH HEINE, _Musical Notes from Paris_.


  O daughters! make your markets while you can,

  He was the most even-tempered man I ever knew:

  I have a horse--a ryghte good horse--
    Ne doe I envie those
  Who scour ye plaine in headie course,

  Story of Lord Middleton, out hunting, calling to

  She's rising now, and taking off her bonnet,
  And probably will end by sitting on it;
  For oft, as sad experiences teach,
  The novice, trembling from his maiden speech,
  Drops flustered in his place, and crushes flat
  His innocent and all-unconscious hat.

        _2nd Lady_, in G. O. TREVELYAN's _Ladies in Parliament_.


  _ON A LEFT-HANDED WRITING-MASTER._

  Though Nature thee of thy right hand bereft,

  We are never so much disposed to quarrel with

  The cockney, met in Middlesex, or Surrey,
  Is often cold, and always in a hurry.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Speaking one day of a newly risen sect of religionists
  who proscribed the use of animal food,
  the Archbishop [Whately] said to Dr. Wilson,

  which is a book of cookery."

  sagesse.

        CHARRON, _La Sagesse_.


  For he himself has said it,
  And it's greatly to his credit,
    That he is an Englishman!
  For he might have been a Roosian,
  A French, or Turk, or Proosian,
    Or perhaps Italian!
  But in spite of all temptations
  To belong to other nations,
    He remains an Englishman!

        W. S. GILBERT, _H.M.S. Pinafore_.


  Baron Alderson being asked by the chaplain

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  _ON EVENING DRESS._

  When dress'd for the evening, girls, nowadays,
   Scarce an atom of dress on them leave;
  Nor blame them--for what is an Evening Dress,
    But a dress that is suited to Eve?

        ANON.


  It's the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever
  believed, to say a woman makes a house comfortable.
  It's a story got up, because the women
  are there, and something must be found for 'em to do.
  I tell you there isn't a thing under the sun that needs to
  be done at all, but what a man can do better than a
  woman, unless it's bearing children, and they do that in
  a poor make-shift way. It had better ha' been left to
  the men.

        _Bartle Massey_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  To sniggle or to dibble, that's the question!
  Whether to bait a hook with worm or bumble,
  Or to take up arms of any sea, some trouble
  To fish, and then home send 'em. To fly--to whip--
  To moor and tie my boat up by the end
  To any wooden post, or natural rock
  We may be near to, on a Preservation
  Devoutly to be fished. To fly--to whip--
  To whip! perchance two bream;--and there's the chub!

        F. C. BURNAND, _Happy Thoughts_.


  Anecdote of Phil Stone, the property-man of
  Drury Lane:--"Will you be so good, sir, as to
  stand a little backer?" said Phil to a gentleman
  behind the scenes, who had placed himself so forward as
  to be seen by the audience. "No, my fine fellow," returned
  the exquisite, who quite mistook his meaning;
  "but here is a pinch of snuff at your service."

        R. H. BARHAM, _Life_.


  At a friend's house Charles Lamb was presented
  with a cheese; it was a very ripe, not to say a
  lively cheese, and, as Lamb was leaving, his
  friend offered him a piece of paper in which to wrap it,
  so that he might convey it more conveniently. "Thank
  you," said Charles, "but would not several yards of
  twine be better, and then, you know, I could _lead_ it
  home?"

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _Patchwork_.


  "A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
   "Is what we chiefly need;
  Pepper and vinegar besides
    Are very good indeed--
  Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
    We can begin to feed."

  "But not on us," the Oysters cried,
    Turning a little blue.
  "After such kindness, that would be
    A dismal thing to do!"
  "The night is fine," the Walrus said;
    "Do you admire the view?"

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Through the Looking-Glass_.


  Religion is like the fashion. One man wears
  his doublet slashed, another laced, another plain;
  but every man has a doublet: so every man has
  his religion. We differ about the trimming.

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
   But only give a bust of marriages;
  For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
    There's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss.

        LORD BYRON, _Don Juan_.


  A young lady decorously brought up should only
  have two considerations in her choice of a
  husband: first, is his birth honourable? secondly,
  will his death be advantageous? All other trifling details
  should be left to parental anxiety.

        _Madame Deschappelles_, in LORD LYTTON's _Lady of Lyons_.


  "The doctor's as drunk as the d----," we said,
    And we managed a shutter to borrow;
  We rais'd him, and sigh'd at the thought that his head
    Would consumedly ache on the morrow.

  We bore him home and we put him to bed,
    And we told his wife and his daughter
  To give him next morning a couple of red-
    Herrings with soda-water.

  Slowly and sadly we all walked down
    From his room in the uppermost story;
  A rush-light we placed on the cold hearth-stone,
    And left him alone in his glory.

        R. H. BARHAM, _Ingoldsby Lyrics_.


  Benjamin Franklin was always proud of
  telling how he entered Philadelphia, for the first
  time, with nothing in the world but two shillings
  in his pocket and four rolls of bread under his arm. But
  really, when you come to examine it critically, it was
  nothing. Anybody could have done it.

        MARK TWAIN, _Choice Works_.


  I've thought very often 'twould be a good thing
  In all public collections of books, if a wing
  Were set off by itself, like the seas from the dry lands,
  Marked "_Literature suited to desolate islands_",14113
  And filled with such books as could never be read
  Save by readers of proofs, forced to do it for bread,--
  Such books as one's wrecked on in small country taverns,
  Such as hermits might mortify over in caverns,
  Such as Satan, if printing had then been invented,
  As a climax of woe, would to Jove have presented,
  Such as Crusoe might dip in, although there are few so
  Outrageously cornered by fate as poor Crusoe.

        J. R. LOWELL, _A Fable for Critics_.


  _Bellmour._ Ah! courtship to marriage is but
  as the music in the play-house till the curtain's
  drawn; but that once up, then opens the scene
  of pleasure.
  _Belinda._ Oh, foh--no; rather, courtship to marriage
  is a very witty prologue to a very dull play.

        CONGREVE, _The Old Bachelor_.


  _ON HEARING A LADY PRAISE A CERTAIN
  REV. DOCTOR'S EYES._

  I cannot praise the Doctor's eyes;
   I never saw his glance divine;
  He always shuts them when he prays,
    And when he preaches he shuts mine.

        G. OUTRAM, _Lyrics: Legal, etc._


  This picture is a great work of art. It is an oil
  painting--done in petroleum. It is by the Old
  Masters. It was the last thing they did before
  dying. They did this and then they expired.

  Some of the greatest artists in London come here
  every morning before daylight with lanterns to look at it.
  They say they never saw anything like it before--and
  they hope they never shall again.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  _THE WORLD._

  The world is like a rink, you know:
  You lose your _wheel_, and come to woe!

  Men will sooner forgive an injury than an insult.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  Why is it that stupid people are always so much
  more anxious to talk to one, than clever people?

        CHARLES BUXTON, _Notes of Thought_.


  And Darwin, too, who leads the throng "in vulgum voces spargere,"
  Maintains Humanity is nought except a big menagerie,
  The progeny of tailless apes, sharp-eared but puggy-nosed, sir,
  Who nightly climbed their "family trees," and on the top reposed, sir.

  There's Carlyle, on the other hand, whose first and last concern it is
  To preach up the "immensities" and muse on the "eternities";
  But if one credits what one hears, the gist of all his brag is, sir,
  That "Erbwürst," rightly understood, is transcendental haggis, sir.

        F. D., in _Pall Mall Gazette_.


  _DUNSFORD._ Travelling is a great trial of people's
  inability to live together.
  _Ellesmere._ Yes. Lavater says that you do
  not know a man until you have divided an inheritance
  with him; but I think a long journey with him will do.

        ARTHUR HELPS, _Friends in Council_.

  _ON AN ALDERMAN._

  That he was born it cannot be denied;
  He ate, drank, slept, talk'd politics, and died.

        JOHN CUNNINGHAM (1729-1773).


  At a large dinner party at Jerdan's, one of the
  guests indulged in some wonderful accounts of
  his shooting. The number of birds he had
  killed, and the distances at which he had brought them
  down, were extraordinary. Hood quietly remarked,--
      "What he hit is history,
       What he missed is mystery."

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  I'm very fond of water:
    It ever must delight
  Each mother's son or daughter--
    When qualified aright.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.


  An epicure, while eating oysters, swallowed one that
  was not fresh. "Zounds, waiter!" he ejaculated,
  making a wry face; "what sort of an oyster do
  you call this?" "A native, sir," replied the wielder of the
  knife. "A native!--I call it a _settler_, so you need not
  open any more."

        HORACE SMITH, _The Tin Trumpet_.


  Once Uncle went astray,
  Smoked, joked, and swore away--
  Sworn by he's now, by a
            Large congregation.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  You've heard what a lady in Italy did--
  How to vex a cross husband she buried a "kid!"
  Sam swears she'd have managed things better by half
  If, instead of the "kid," she had buried the calf!

        R. H. BARHAM, _Ingoldsby Lyrics_.


  Il est plus facile de légaliser certaines choses que
  de les légitimer.

        CHAMFORT, _Maximes_.


  Wilt thou love me, fairest?
    Though thou art not fair,
  And I think thou wearest
    Some one else's hair.
  Thou couldst love, though, dearly:
    And, as I am told,
  Thou art very nearly
    Worth thy weight, in gold.

  Dost thou love, sweet one?
    Tell me if thou dost!
  Women fairly beat one,
    But I think thou must.
  Thou art loved so dearly:
    I am plain, but then
  Thou (to speak sincerely)
    Art as plain again.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  "Certainly, my Lord," said the attendant.
  "He knows me," thought Lothair; but it
  was not so. When the British nation is at
  once grateful and enthusiastic, they always call you "my
  Lord."

        LORD BEACONSFIELD's _Lothair_.


  _THE RECOGNITION._

  Home they brought her sailor son,
    Grown a man across the sea,
  Tall and broad and black of beard,
    And hoarse of voice as man may be.

  Hand to shake and mouth to kiss,
    Both he offered ere he spoke;
  And she said--"What man is this
    Comes to play a sorry joke?"

  Then they praised him--call'd him "smart,"
    "Tightest lad that ever stept;"
  But her son she did not know,
    And she neither smiled nor wept.

  Rose, a nurse of ninety years,
    Set a pigeon-pie in sight;
  She saw him eat--"'Tis he! 'tis he!"
    She knew him--by his appetite!

        WILLAM SAWYER.


  Lord Allen, being rather the worse for drinking
  too much wine at dinner, teased Count D'Orsay,
  and said some very disagreeable things, which
  irritated him; when suddenly John Bush entered the
  club and shook hands with the Count, who exclaimed,
  "Voilà, la différence entre une bonne _bouche_ et une mauvaise
  _haleine_."

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  _ANOTHER WAY._

  When lovely woman, Lump of Folly,
    Would show the world her vainest trait;
  Would treat herself as child her dolly,
    And warn each man of sense away;
  The surest method she'll discover
    To prompt a wink from every eye,
  Degrade a spouse, disgust a lover,
    And spoil a scalp-skin, is--to dye.

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  The bean is a graceful, confiding, engaging vine;
  but you can never put beans into poetry, nor
  into the highest sort of prose. Corn is the child
  of song. It waves in all literature. But mix it with
  beans, and its high tone is gone. The bean is a vulgar
  vegetable, without culture, or any flavour of high society
  among vegetables.

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  Then Abner Dean of Angel's raised a point of order, when
  A church of old red sandstone took him in the abdomen,
  And he smiled a kind of sickly smile, and curled up on the floor,
  And the subsequent proceedings interested him no more.

        BRET HARTE, _Complete Works_.


  "I was born, Signora, on New Year's Night,
  1800." "Did I not tell you," said the Marquis,
  "that he is one of the first men of our century?"

        HEINRICH HEINE, _Travel Pictures_.


  When dinner has opprest one,
  I think it is perhaps the gloomiest hour
  Which turns up out of the sad twenty-four.

        LORD BYRON, _Don Juan_.


  As a boy, George Washington gave no promise of
  the greatness he was one day to achieve. He
  was ignorant of the commonest accomplishments
  of youth. He could not even lie. But then he
  never had any of those precious advantages which are
  within the reach of the humblest of the boys of the
  present day. Any boy can lie now. I could lie before
  I could stand.

        MARK TWAIN, _Choice Works_.


  By the way, Shakespeare endorses polygamy. He
  speaks of the Merry Wives of Windsor. How
  many wives did Mr. Windsor have?

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  I dare say she's like the rest o' the women--
  thinks two and two'll come to make five, if she
  cries and bothers enough about it.

        _Bartle Massey_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  Don't you see a hint of marriage
    In his sober-sided face,
  In his rather careless carriage
    And extremely rapid pace?

  If he's not committed treason,
    Or some wicked action done,
  Can you see the faintest reason
    Why a bachelor should run?

  Why should he be in a flurry?
    But a loving wife to greet,
  Is a circumstance to hurry
    The most dignified of feet!

        JOHN GODFREY SAXE, _Poems_.


  Mr. Luttrell once said to me, "Sir, the man
  who says he does not like a good dinner, is
  either a fool or a liar."

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  _TO PHOEBE._

  "Gentle, modest little flower,
    Sweet epitome of May,
  Love me but for half an hour,
    Love me, love me, little fay."
  Sentences so swiftly flaming
    In your tiny shell-like ear,
  I should always be exclaiming
    If I loved you, Phoebe dear:

  "Smiles that thrill from any distance
    Shed upon me while I sing!
  Please ecstaticize existence,
    Love me, oh thou, fairy thing!"
  Words like these outpouring sadly
    You'd perpetually hear,
  If I loved you fondly, madly;--
    But I do not, Phoebe dear.

        W. S. GILBERT, _Bab Ballads_.


  On one occasion, when Power the actor was
  present, Hood was asked to propose his health.
  After enumerating the various talents that popular
  comedian possessed, he requested the company to
  observe that such a combination was a remarkable
  illustration of the old proverb, "It never rains but it
  _powers_."

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  I dreamed that somebody was dead. It was a
  private gentleman, and a particular friend; and
  I was greatly overcome when the news was
  broken to me (very delicately) by a gentleman in a
  cocked hat, top boots, and a sheet. Nothing else.
  "Good God!" I said, "is he dead?" "He is as dead,
  sir," rejoined the gentleman, "as a door nail. But we
  must all die, Mr. Dickens, sooner or later, my dear sir."
  "Ah!" I said; "yes, to be sure. Very true. But
  what did he die of?" The gentleman burst into a flood
  of tears, and said, in a voice broken by emotion, "He
  christened his youngest child, sir, with a toasting fork!"

        CHARLES DICKENS, _apud_ J. T. FIELDS.


  I suppose all phrases of mere compliment have
  their turn to be true. A man is occasionally
  thankful when he says "thank you."

        _Stephen Guest_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Mill on the Floss_.


  _ON ATALANTA._

  When the young Greek for Atalanta sigh'd,
  He might have fool'd and follow'd till he died!
  He learn'd the sex, the bribe before her roll'd,
  And found, the short way to the heart, is--Gold.

        GEORGE CROLY (1780-1860).


  _De mortuis nil nisi bene_: of the living speak nothing
  but evil.

        HEINRICH HEINE, _Thoughts and Fancies_.


  I once met a man who had forgiven an injury.
  I hope some day to meet the man who has forgiven
  an insult.

        CHARLES BUXTON, _Notes of Thought_.


  Walk in the Park--you'll seldom fail
  To find a Sybaris on the rail
          By Lydia's ponies,
  Or hap on Barrus, wigged, and stayed,
  Ogling some unsuspecting maid.

  The great Gargilius, then, behold!
  His "long-bow" hunting tales of old
          Are now but duller;
  Fair Neobule too! Is not
  One Hebrus here--from Aldershot?
          Aha, you colour!
  Be wise. There old Canidia sits;
  No doubt she's tearing you to bits.

  Here's Pyrrha, "golden-haired" at will;
  Prig Damasippus, preaching still;
          Asterie flirting,--
  Radiant, of course. We'll make her black,--
  Ask her when Gyges' ship comes back.

        AUSTIN DOBSON, _Vignettes in Rhyme_.


  La reconnaissance de la plupart des hommes n'est
  qu'une secrète envie de recevoir de plus grands
  bienfaits.

        LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, _Réflexions_.


  The surest way to make ourselves agreeable to
  others is by seeming to think them so.

        W. HAZLITT, _Characteristics_.


  _SELF-EVIDENT._

  When other lips and other eyes
    Their tales of love shall tell,
  Which means the usual sort of lies
    You've heard from many a swell;
  When, bored with what you feel is bosh,
    You'd give the world to see
  A friend whose love you know will wash,
    Oh, then remember me!

  When Signor Solo goes his tours,
    And Captain Craft's at Ryde,
  And Lord Fitzpop is on the moors,
    And Lord knows who beside;
  When to exist you feel a task
    Without a friend at tea,
  At such a moment I but ask
    That you'll remember me.

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Songs and Poems_.


  When a man is called stingy, it is as much as calling
  him rich; and when a man's called rich, why
  he's a man universally respected.

        _Sir John Vesey_, in LORD LYTTON's _Money_.


  Cursed be the Bank of England notes, that tempt the soul to sin!
  Cursed be the want of acres,--doubly cursed the want of tin!

  Cursed be the marriage-contract, that enslaved thy soul to greed!
  Cursed be the sallow lawyer, that prepared and drew the deed!

  Cursed be his foul apprentice, who the loathsome fees did earn!
  Cursed be the clerk and parson--cursed be the whole concern!

        _Bon Gaultier Ballads._


  Never hold anybody by the button, or the hand,
  in order to be heard out; for, if people are not
  willing to hear you, you had much better hold
  your tongue than them.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  I have learned to love Lucy, though faded she be;
  If my next love be lovely, the better for me;
  By the end of next summer, I'll give you my oath,
  It was best, after all, to have flirted with both.

        CHARLES GODFREY LELAND.


  General Ornano, observing a certain nobleman--who,
  by some misfortune in his youth,
  lost the use of his legs--in a Bath chair, which
  he wheeled about, and inquiring the name of the
  English peer, D'Orsay answered, "Père la Chaise."

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  Poet-professor! Now my brain thou kindlest:
  I am become a most determined Tyndallist.
    If it is known a fellow can make skies,
      Why not make bright blue eyes?

  This to deny the folly of a dunce it is:
  Surely a girl as easy as a sunset is?
    If you can make a halo or eclipse,
      Why not two laughing lips?

  Why should an author scribble rhymes or articles?
  Bring me a dozen tiny Tyndall-particles:
    Therefrom I'll coin a dinner, Nash's wine,
      And a nice girl to dine.

        MORTIMER COLLINS, _The British Birds_.


  They now speak of the peculiar difficulties and
  restrictions of the Episcopal Office. I only
  read in Scripture of two inhibitions--boxing and
  polygamy.

        SYDNEY SMITH, _apud_ LORD HOUGHTON.


  _ON AN OFFERING MADE BY KING JAMES I. AT
  A GRAVE COMEDY CALLED "THE MARRIAGE
  OF ARTS."_

  At Christ Church "Marriage," play'd before the King,
  Lest these learn'd mates should want an offering,
  The King himself did offer--what, I pray?
  He offer'd, once or twice--to go away.

        _A Collection of Epigrams_ (1727).


  ---- has only two ideas, and they are his legs, and
  they are spindle-shanked.

        LADY ASHBURTON, _apud_ LORD HOUGHTON.


  Dry as Compton's fun,
    Dry as author's pocket;
  Bright as that loved one
    Whose face adorns my locket;
  At the beaker's brim
    Beading brittle bubbles,
  Sea in which to swim,
    And cast away all troubles;
  Sea where sorrow sinks,
    Ne'er to rise again--oh,
  Blessedest of drinks,
      Welcome, "Pommery Gréno!"

        EDMUND YATES.


  _ON CLOSE-FIST'S SUBSCRIPTION._

  The charity of Close-Fist, give to fame:--
  He has at last subscrib'd--how much?--his name.

        ANON.


  The late Bishop of Exeter and Baron Alderson
  were sitting next each other at a public dinner.
  After the usual toasts had been drunk, the
  health of "The Navy" was proposed. Lord Campbell,
  expecting to have to return thanks for "The Bar,"
  and not having heard the toast distinctly, got up. On
  which the late bishop whispered to Baron Alderson,
  "What is Campbell about? What is he returning thanks
  for the Navy for?" "Oh," answered the witty judge,
  "he has made a mistake. He thinks the word is
  spelt with a K."

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  Song-birds darted about, some inky
    As coal, some snowy (I ween) as curds;
  Or rosy as pinks, or as roses pinky--
    They reck of no eerie To-come, these birds!

  But they skim over bents which the mill-stream washes,
    Or hang in the lift 'neath a white cloud's hem;
  They need no parasols, no goloshes;
    And good Mrs. Trimmer she feedeth them.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  The man who's fond precociously of stirring
  Must be a spoon.

        THOMAS HOOD.


  _ON ONE PETER AND HIS WIFE._

  Outrageous hourly with his wife was Peter;
  Some do aver he has been known to beat her.
  "She seems unhappy," said a friend one day;
  Peter turn'd sharply: "What is that you say?
  Her temper you have there misunderstood:
  She dares not be unhappy if she would."

        WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR.


  A man who puts a non-natural strained sense on a
  promise is no better than a robber.

        _Rev. A. Debarry_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Felix Holt_.


  _DISTICH._

  What is a first love worth except to prepare for a second?
  What does the second love bring? Only regret for the first.

        JOHN HAY, _Poems_.


  In [Lady Charlotte Lindsay's] later days, when once
  complimented on looking very well, she replied,
  "I dare say it's true--the bloom of ugliness is
  past."

        LORD HOUGHTON, _Monographs_.


  _IN VIRTUTEM._

  Virtue we praise, yet practise not her good.
    (Athenian-like) we act not what we know.
  So many men do talk of Robin Hood
    Who never yet shot arrow from his bow.

        THOMAS FREEMAN (_circa_ 1591-1614).


  Scandal--what one half the world takes a
  pleasure in inventing, and the other half in
  believing.

        HORACE SMITH, _The Tin Trumpet_.


  _All's for the best_, indeed
  Such is My simple creed;
  Still I must go and weed
            Hard in my garden.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Where's the use of talking to a woman with
  babbies? She's got no conscience--no conscience--it's
  all run to milk.

        _Bartle Massey_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  Together must we seek
  That undiscovered country, from whose bourn
  No uncommercial travellers return.

  The Mormon's religion is singular, and his wives
  are plural.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


                At morning's call
  The small-voiced pug-dog welcomes in the sun,
  And flea-bit mongrels, wakening one by one,
                Give answer all.

                When evening dim
  Draws round us, then the lovely caterwaul,
  Tart solo, sour duet, and general squall,
                These are our hymn.

        OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.


  Charles Lamb was sitting next some chattering
  woman at dinner. Observing he didn't attend
  to her, "You don't seem," said the lady, "to be
  at all the better for what I have been saying to you."
  "No, ma'am," he answered, "but this gentleman on the
  other side of me must, for it all came in at one ear and
  went out at the other."

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  Forty times over let Michaelmas pass,
    Grizzling hair the brain doth clear--
  Then you know a boy is an ass,
  Then you know the worth of a lass,
    Once you have come to Forty Year.

        W. M. THACKERAY.


  Men are not troubled to hear a man dispraised,
  because they know, though he be naught,
  there's worth in others. But women are mightily
  troubled to hear any one of them spoken against, as if
  the sex itself were guilty of some untrustworthiness.

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  _'TWAS EVER THUS._

  I never rear'd a young gazelle,
    (Because, you see, I never tried);
  But, had it known and loved me well,
    No doubt the creature would have died.
  My rich and aged uncle John
    Has known me long and loves me well,
  But still persists in living on--
    I would he were a young gazelle.

  I never loved a tree or flower;
    But, if I _had_, I beg to say
  The blight, the wind, the sun, or shower,
    Would soon have wither'd it away.
  I've dearly loved my uncle John,
    From childhood till the present hour,
  And yet he will go living on,--
    I would he were a tree or flower!

        H. S. LEIGH, _Carols of Cockayne_.


  A domestic woman.--A woman like a
  domestic.

        ANNE EVANS, _Poems and Music_.


  "The time has come," the Walrus said,
    "To talk of many things;
  Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
    Of cabbages--and kings--
  And why the sea is boiling hot--
    And whether pigs have wings."

  "But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
    "Before we have our chat;
  For some of us are out of breath,
    And all of us are fat!"
  "No hurry!" said the Carpenter:
    They thanked him much for that.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Through the Looking-Glass_.


  Ignorance is not so damnable as humbug, but
  when it prescribes pills it may happen to do
  more harm.

        _Felix Holt_, in GEORGE ELIOT's novel.


  I push aside the blinding books;
    The reverend pages seem to wink;
  Each _letter_ like a _dozen_ looks,
    Which _doesn't let a_ student think.
  Within my ears I hear a "thrum;"
    Before my eyes there floats a haze;
  And mocking shadows flit and come,
    And make my _nights_ a constant _daze_!

        ROBERT REECE, in _Comic Poets_.


  Orthodoxy is at a low ebb. Only two clergymen
  accepted my offer to come and help hoe
  my potatoes for the privilege of using my
  vegetable total-depravity figure about the snake-grass,
  or quash-grass, as some call it; and these two did not
  bring hoes. There seems to be a lack of disposition to
  hoe among our educated clergy.

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  _HOME THEY BROUGHT._

  Home they brought her lap-dog dead,
    Just run over by a fly;
  Jeames to Buttons, winking, said,
    "Won't there be a row? oh my!"

  Then they called the flyman low,
    Said his baseness could be proved,
  How she to the Beak should go,--
    Yet she neither spoke nor moved.

  Said her maid (and risked her place)
    "In the 'ouse it should have kept,
  Flymen drives at such a pace"--
    Still the lady's anger slept.

  Rose her husband, best of dears,
    Laid a bracelet on her knee,
  Like a playful child she boxed his ears,--
    "Sweet old pet!--let's have some tea!"

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  _ON BLESSED IGNORANCE._

  He is most happy, sure, that knoweth nought,
  Because he knows not that he knoweth not.

        ROBERT HEATH (_circa_ 1585-1607).


  Alone amid the festive throng
    One infant brow is sad!
  One cherub face is wet with grief,--
    What ails you, little lad?

  Why still with scarifying sleeve
    That woful visage scrub?
  Ah, much I fear, my gentle boy,
    You don't enjoy your grub.

  Here, on a sympathetic heart,
    Your tale of suffering pour.
  Come, darling! Tell me all. "_Boo--boo--
    I can't eat any more!_"

        H. CHOLMONDELEY PENNELL, _Puck on Pegasus_.


  Never take a sheet-bath--never. Next to meeting
  a lady acquaintance who, for reasons best known
  to herself, don't see you when she looks at you,
  and don't know you when she sees you, it is about the
  most uncomfortable thing in the world.

        MARK TWAIN, _Choice Works_.


  The critic's lot is passing hard--
    Between ourselves, I think reviewers,
  When call'd to truss a crowing bard,
    Should not be sparing of the skewers.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  To-morrow the critics will commence. You
  know who the critics are? The men who have
  failed in literature and art.

        _Phoebus_, in LORD BEACONSFIELD's _Lothair_.


  That climax of all human ills--
  The inflammation of his weekly bills.

        LORD BYRON, _Don Juan_.


  On n'a guère de défauts qui ne soient plus pardonnables
  que les moyens dont on se sert pour les
  cacher.

        LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, _Réflexions_.


  Meeting a friend one day, when the weather had
  taken a most sudden and unaccountable turn
  from cold to warmth, the subject was mooted
  as usual, and characterized by the gentleman as being
  "most extraordinary." "Yes," replied [Compton], "it
  is a most unheard of thing; we've jumped from winter
  into summer without a spring."

        _Memoir of Henry Compton._


  "Pray what is this Permissive Bill,
    That some folks rave about?
  I can't with all my pains and skill,
    Its meaning quite make out?"
  O! it's a little simple Bill,
    That seeks to pass _incog._,
  To _permit_ ME--to _prevent_ YOU--
    From having a glass of grog.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.


  Quelque mal qu'un homme puisse penser des
  femmes, il n'y a pas de femme qui n'en pense
  encore plus mal que lui.

        CHAMFORT, _Maximes_.


  With thy fogs, all so thick and so yellow,
    The most approved tint for _ennui_,
  Oh, when shall a man see thy fellow,
    November, for _felo-de-se_?

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Songs and Poems_.


  "Life," continued Mr. Rose, "is a series of
  moments and emotions."
  "And a series of absurdities, too, very
  often," said Dr. Jenkinson.
  "Life is a solemn mystery," said Mr. Stocks, severely.
  "Life is a damned nuisance," muttered Leslie to himself.

        W. H. MALLOCK, _The New Republic_.


  The world's an ugly world. Offend
    Good people, how they wrangle!
  Their manners that they never mend,--
    The characters they mangle!
  They eat, and drink, and scheme, and plod,--
    They go to church on Sunday;
  And many are afraid of God--
    And more of _Mrs. Grundy_.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  I went away the first, in order to give the men an
  opportunity of abusing me; for whenever the
  men abuse, the women, to support alike their
  coquetry and the conversation, think themselves called
  upon to defend.

        _Pelham_, in LORD LYTTON's novel.


  There's one John Bright, a Manchester man,
    Who taught the Tories to rule,
  By setting their stamp on his patent plan
    For renewing the youth of John Bull;
        But I say that it won't do at all.
            To seek for salvation
            By mere numeration
            Of polls would surprise,
            If they were to rise,
        Not a little both Plato and Paul.

        J. S. BLACKIE, _Musa Burschicosa_.


  Une femme vertueuse a dans le coeur une fibre du
  moins ou de plus que les autres femmes; elle est
  stupide ou sublime.

        BALZAC, _Physiologie du Mariage_.


  _ON SCOTCH WEATHER._

  Scotland! thy weather's like a modish wife;
  Thy winds and rains for ever are at strife;
  Like thee the termagants their blustering try,
  And, when they can no longer scold, they cry.

        AARON HILL (1685-1750).


  Went with Lamb to Richman's. Richman produced
  one of Chatterton's forgeries. In one
  manuscript there were seventeen different kinds
  of e's. "Oh," said Lamb, "that must have been written
  by one of the--
      'Mob of gentlemen who write with _ease_.'"

        CRABB ROBINSON, _Diary_.


  _SCIRE TUUM NIHIL FIT._

  To have a thing is little, if you're not allowed to show it,
  And to know a thing is nothing, unless others know you know it.

        LORD NEAVES.


  You're at an evening party, with
    A group of pleasant folks,--
  You venture quietly to crack
    The least of little jokes,--
  A lady doesn't catch the point,
    And begs you to explain,--
  Alas! for one who drops a jest
    And takes it up again!

  You drop a pretty _jeu-de-mot_
    Into a neighbour's ears,
  Who likes to give you credit for
    The clever things he hears;
  And so he hawks your jest about,
    The old, authentic one,
  Just breaking off the point of it,
    And leaving out the pun!

        JOHN GODFREY SAXE, _Poems_.


  [Montrond's] death was a very wretched one.
  Left alone to the tender mercies of a well-known
  "lorette" of those days, Desirée R----,
  as he lay upon his bed, between fits of pain and drowsiness,
  he could see his fair friend picking from his shelves
  the choicest specimens of his old Sèvres china, or other
  articles of _vertu_. Turning to his doctor, he said, with a
  gleam of his old fun, "Qu'elle est attachante, cette
  femme-là!"

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  We love thee, Ann Maria Smith,
    And in thy condescension
  We see a future full of joys
    Too numerous to mention.

  There's Cupid's arrow in thy glance,
    That by thy love's coercion
  Has reached our melting heart of hearts,
    And asked for one insertion.

  There's music in thy honest tone,
    And silver in thy laughter;
  And truth--but we will give the full
    Particulars hereafter.

        R. H. NEWELL, _Orpheus C. Kerr Papers_.


  "Of course you know the three reasons which take
  men into society in London?" I said, after a
  pause.

  "No, I don't. What are they?"

  "Either to find a wife, or to look after one's wife, or
  to look after somebody else's."

        L. OLIPHANT, _Piccadilly_.


  _ON ONE WHO HAD A LARGE NOSE AND SQUINTED._

  The reason why Doctor Dash squints, I suppose,
  Is because his two eyes are afraid of his nose.

        ANON., in MOORE's _Diary_.


  Never attack whole bodies of any kind. Individuals
  forgive sometimes; but bodies and
  societies never do.

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  _ON THE RIGHTS OF MINORITIES._

  Sturdy Tom Paine, biographers relate,
  Once with his friends engaged in warm debate.
  Said they, "Minorities are always right;"
  Said he, "The truth is just the opposite."
  Finding them stubborn, "Frankly, now," said he,
  "In this opinion do ye all agree;
  All, every one, without exception?" When
  They thus affirmed unanimously, "Then,
  Correct," said he, "my sentiment must be,
  For I myself am the minority."

        R. GARNETT, _Idylls and Epigrams_.


  The Indians on the Overland Route live on route

  They drink with impunity, or anybody who
  invites them.

  _ON ONE WEARING FALSE HAIR._

  They say that thou dost tinge (O monstrous lie!)
  The hair that thou so raven-black dost buy.

        LUCILIUS, trans. by R. GARNETT.


  A nation does wisely if not well, in starving her
  men of genius. Fatten them, and they are done
  for.

        CHARLES BUXTON, _Notes of Thought_.


  When the enterprising burglar's not a-burgling,
    When the cut-throat isn't occupied with crime
  He loves to hear the little brook a-gurgling,
    And listen to the merry village chime.
  When the coster's finished jumping on his mother,
    He loves to lie a-basking in the sun--
  Oh! take one consideration with another,
    The policeman's lot is not a happy one!

        W. S. GILBERT, _Pirates of Penzance_.


  The young girl said: "The gentleman must be very
  rich, for he is very ugly." The public judges in
  a similar manner: "The man must be very
  learned, for he is very tiresome."

        HEINRICH HEINE, _Thoughts and Fancies_.


  And he chirped and sang, and skipped about, and
    laughed with laughter hearty,
  He was so wonderfully active for so very stout
    a party.

  And I said, "O gentle pie-man, why so very, very merry?
  Is it purity of conscience, or your one-and-seven sherry?"

        W. S. GILBERT, _Bab Ballads_.


  Speculation--a word that sometimes begins
  with its second letter.

        HORACE SMITH, _The Tin Trumpet_.


  He remembers the ball at the Ferry,
   And the ride, and the gate, and the vow,
  And the rose that you gave him--that very
    Same rose he is treasuring now
  (Which his blanket he's kicked on his trunk, Miss,
    And insists on his legs being free;
  And his language to me from his bunk, Miss,
    Is frequent and painful and free).

        BRET HARTE, _Complete Works_.


  Nous ne trouvons guère de gens de bons sens que
  ceux qui sont de notre avis.

        LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, _Réflexions_.


  _FRENCH AND ENGLISH._

  The French excel us very much in millinery;
  They also bear the bell in matters culinary.
  The reason's plain: French beauty and French meat
  With English cannot of themselves compete.
  Thus, an inferior article possessing,
  Our neighbours help it by superior dressing;
  They dress their dishes, and they dress their dames,
  Till Art, almost, can rival Nature's claims.

        LORD NEAVES, _Songs and Verses_.


  Priority is a poor recommendation in a husband
  if he has got no other.

        _Mrs. Cadwallader_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Middlemarch_.


  If spirits you would lighten
  Consult good Doctor Brighton,
      And swallow his prescriptions and abide by his decree:
  If nerves be weak or shaken
  Just try a week with Bacon,
  His physic soon is taken--
      At our London-by-the-Sea.

        J. ASHBY STERRY, _Boudoir Ballads_.


  The then Duke of Cumberland (the foolish Duke,
  as he was called) came one night into Foote's
  green-room at the Haymarket Theatre. "Well,
  Foote," said he, "here I am, ready, as usual, to swallow
  your good things." "Upon my soul," replied Foote,
  "your Royal Highness must have an excellent digestion,
  for you never bring any up again."

        ROGERS, _Table Talk_.


  There's folks born to property, and there's folks

  as catch hold.

       _Tommy Trounsem_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Felix Holt_.


  Examining one of the Sunday school boys at
  Addington, I asked him what a prophet was.
  He did not know. "If I were to tell you what
  would happen to you this day twelve month, and it should
  come to pass, what would you call me then, my little
  man?" "A fortune-teller, sir."

  Being one day at Trinity College, at dinner,
  [Donne] was asked to write a motto for the
  College snuff-box, which was always circulating
  on the dinner-table. "Considering where we are," said
  Donne, "there could be nothing better than 'Quicunque
  vult.'"

        CRABB ROBINSON, _Diary_.


  Critics tell me, soon
  There'll be no singing in a song,
    No melody in tune.
  But birds will warble in the trees,
    Nor for the critics care;
  And in the murmur of the breeze
    We yet may find some air.

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Songs and Poems_.


  Mr. Bentley proposed to establish a periodical
  publication, to be called "The Wits' Miscellany."
  [James] Smith objected that the title promised
  too much. Shortly afterwards the publisher came to
  tell him he had profited by the hint, and resolved to call
  it "Bentley's Miscellany." "Isn't that going a little too
  far the other way?" was the remark.

        ABRAHAM HAYWARD, _Essays_.


  Break, break, break!
    My cups and saucers, O scout;
  And I'm glad that my tongue can't utter
    The oaths that my soul points out.

  It is well for the china-shop man
    Who gets a fresh order each day;
  And it's deucedly well for yourself,
    Who are in the said china-man's pay.

  And my stately vases go
    To your uncle's, I ween, to be cashed;
  And it's oh for the light of my broken lamp,
    And the tick of my clock that is smashed.

  Break, break, break!
    At the foot of my stairs in glee;
  But the coin I have spent in glass that is cracked
    Will never come back to me.

        _The Shotover Papers._


  Croly said very smart things, and with surprising
  readiness. I was at his table one day when one
  of the guests inquired the name of a pyramidal
  dish of barley-sugar. Some one replied, "A pyramid
  _à Macédoine_." "For what use?" rejoined the other.
  "To give a _Philip_ to the appetite," said Croly.

  _ON SOME VERSES CALLED TRIFLES._

  Paul, I have read your book, and though you write ill,
  I needs must praise your most judicious title.

        ANON.


  Mrs. Posh was one of those incomparable wives
  who have a proper command of tongue, who
  never reply to angry words at the moment, and
  who always, with exquisite calm and self-posession, pay
  off every angry word by an amiable sting at the right
  moment.

        LORD LYTTON, _What will he do with it?_


  _TO LADY BROWN._

  When I was young and _débonnaire_,
    The brownest nymph to me was fair;
  But now I'm old, and wiser grown,
    The fairest nymph to me is Brown.

        GEORGE, LORD LYTTLETON.


  When last the Queen was about to be confined,
  the Prince Consort said to one of his little boys,
  "I think it very likely, my dear, that the Queen
  will present you with a little brother or sister; which of
  the two would you prefer?" The child, pausing--"Well,
  I think, if it is all the same to mamma, I should
  prefer a pony."

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  Some ladies now make pretty songs,
    And some make pretty nurses:
  Some men are great at righting wrongs,--
    And some at writing verses.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  Follow the light of the old-fashioned Presbyterians
  that I've heard sing at Glasgow. The
  preacher gives out the Psalm, and then everybody
  sings a different tune, as it happens to turn up in
  their throats. It's a domineering thing to set a tune
  and expect everybody else to follow it. It's a denial of
  private judgment.

        _Felix Holt_, in GEORGE ELIOT's novel.


  _ON A CERTAIN RADICAL._

  Bloggs rails against high birth. Yes, Bloggs--you see
  Your ears are longer than your pedigree.

  I like neighbours, and I like chickens; but I do
  not think they ought to be united near a garden.

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  Lady, very fair are you,
  And your eyes are very blue,
        And your hose;
  And your brow is like the snow,
  And the various things you know
        Goodness knows.

        MORTIMER COLLINS, _Ad Chloen, M.A._


  The Jacobins, in realizing their systems of fraternization,
  always contrived to be the elder

        LORD CHESTERFIELD, _Letters to his Son_.


  There was gorging Jack and guzzling Jimmy,
    And the youngest he was little Billee.
  Now when they got as far as the Equator
    They'd nothing left but one split pea.

  Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy,
    "I am extremely hungaree."
  To gorging Jack says guzzling Jimmy,
    "We've nothing left, us must eat we."

  Says gorging Jack to guzzling Jimmy,
    "With one another we shouldn't agree!
  There's little Bill he's young and tender,
    We're old and tough, so let's eat he."

  "_WHAT AILS HIM AT THE LASSIE?_"

  A friend tells me a funny little story of Mrs. ----
  (the grandmother of Colonel M----), who was
  shown a picture of Joseph and Potiphar's wife,
  in which of course the patriarch showed his usual desire
  to withdraw himself from her society. Mrs. ---- looked
  at it for a little while, and then said, "Eh, now, and what
  ails him at the lassie?"

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _Patchwork_.


  In his last illness, reduced as he was to a skeleton,
  [Hood] noticed a very large mustard poultice
  which Mrs. Hood was making for him, and exclaimed,
  "O Mary! Mary! that will be a great deal of
  mustard to a very little meat!"

  _THE LATEST DECALOGUE._

  Thou shalt have one God only: who
  Would be at the expense of two?
  No graven images may be
  Worshipped, except the currency:
  Swear not at all; for, for thy curse,
  Thine enemy is none the worse:
  At church on Sunday to attend
  Will serve to keep the world thy friend:
  Honour thy parents; that is, all
  From whom advancement may befall:
  Thou shalt not kill; but needst not strive
  Officiously to keep alive:
  Do not adultery commit;
  Advantage rarely comes of it:
  Thou shalt not steal; an empty feat,
  When it's so lucrative to cheat:
  Bear not false witness; let the lie
  Have time on its own wings to fly:
  Thou shalt not covet, but tradition
  Approves all forms of competition.

        A. H. CLOUGH, _Poems_.


  Mr. MacCulloch, the eminent political
  economist, in dining with us, a few days after
  [an aeronautical friend had made an ascent],
  was most anxious to learn where he had descended
  on this occasion. The answer was, "Amongst the flats
  of Essex." "A most appropriate locality," said my
  distinguished countryman, "and one which shows how
  true it is that 'birds of a feather flock together.'"

        MARK BOYD, _Reminiscences._


  He said that I was proud, mother,--that I looked for rank and gold;
  He said I did not love him,--he said my words were cold;
  He said I kept him off and on, in hopes of higher game,--
  And it may be that I did, mother; but who hasn't done the same?

  You may lay me in my bed, mother,--my head is throbbing sore;
  And, mother, prithee, let the sheets be duly aired before;
  And if you'd do a kindness to your poor desponding child,
  Draw me a pot of beer, mother--and, mother, draw it mild!

  _ON A THEATRICAL NUISANCE:_

  Perched in a box which cost her not a _sou_,
  Giglina chatters all the evening through,
  Fidgets with opera-glass, and flowers, and shawls,
  Annoys the actors, irritates the stalls.
  Forgive her harmless pride--the cause is plain--
  She wants us all to know she's had champagne.

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  O, I know the way o' wives; they set one on
  to abuse their husbands, and then they turn
  round on one and praise 'em as if they wanted

  "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
    Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
  O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
    He chortled in his joy.

  'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

  All mimsy were the borogroves,
    And the mome raths outgrabe.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Through the Looking-Glass_.


  Mrs. Wordsworth and a lady were walking
  once in a wood where the stock-dove was
  cooing. A farmer's wife coming by, said, "Oh,
  I do like stock-doves!" Mrs. Wordsworth, in all her
  enthusiasm for Wordsworth's beautiful address to the
  stock-dove, took the old woman to her heart. "But,"
  continued the old woman, "some like 'em in a pie; for
  my part there's nothing like 'em stewed in onions!"

  A friend, who was about to marry the natural

  Casey mentioned to me a parody of his on two
  lines in the "Veiled Prophet":--
    "He knew no more of fear than one who dwells
     Beneath the tropics knows of icicles."

  The following is his parody, which, bless my stars, none
  of my critics were lively enough to hit upon, for it would
  have stuck by me:--
    "He knew no more of fear than one who dwells
     On Scotia's mountains knows of shoe-buckles."

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  Why mourns my Eugene? In his dark eye of blue
  Why trembles the tear-drop to sympathy due?
  Ah, why must a bosom so pure and refin'd
  Thus vibrate, all nerve, at the woes of mankind?

  Like a sunbeam the clouds of the tempest between,
  A smile lights the eye of the pensive Eugene;
  And thus, in soft accents, the mourner replies,
  "Hang your mustard! it brings the tears in my eyes!"

        R. H. BARHAM, _Ingoldsby Lyrics_.


  Dress does not make a man, but it often makes a
  successful one. What all men should avoid is
  the "shabby genteel." No man ever gets over
  it. You had better be in rags.

        _Vigo_, in LORD BEACONSFIELD's _Endymion_.


  In moss-prankt dells which the sunbeams flatter
    (And Heaven it knoweth what that may mean;
  Meaning, however, is no great matter)
    Where woods are a-tremble, with rifts atween;

  Thro' God's own heather we wonn'd together,
    I and my Willie (O love, my love!):
  I need hardly remark it was glorious weather,
    And flitter-bats waver'd alow, above.

  Boats were curtsying, rising, bowing
    (Boats in that climate are so polite),
  And sands were a ribbon of green endowing,
    And O the sun-dazzle on bark and bight.

  Thro' the rare red heather we danced together,
    (O love, my Willie!) and smelt for flowers:
  I must mention again it was glorious weather,
    Rhymes are so scarce in this world of ours.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Fly Leaves_.


  'Tis ridiculous for a lord to print verses. It is well
  enough to make them to please himself, but to
  make them public is foolish. If a man in his
  private chamber twirls his bandstrings, or plays with a
  rush to please himself, 'tis well enough, but if he should
  go into Fleet Street, and sit upon a stall, and twirl
  a bandstring, or play with a rush, then all the boys in
  the street would laugh at him.

        SELDEN, _Table Talk_.


  Here, in the grassy hollow, would be spread
  The snowy cloth--dimpled with various viands.
  Ah! cleanly damask of our native land!
  Ah! pleasant memory of pigeon-pie,
  Short-crusted--savoury-jellied--flow'ry-yolked!
  Ah! fair white-bosomed fowl with tawny tongue
  Well married! lobster-salad, crisp and cool,
  With polished silver from clean crockery
  Forked up--washed down with drinks that make me now
  Thirsty to think of.
                      Yes, with ginger-pop
  These crags should echo.
                              Ah! rare golden gleam
  Of sack in silver goblets gilt within!--
  Bright evanescent raptures of champagne--
  Brisk bottled stout in pewters creamy-crowned!

  Simplicity is best, 'tis true,

  If thou, O maid, canst live on dew,
    'Tis proof thou art indeed a flower.

  On Walpole's remarking that, of two pictures mentioned,

  The nightingales are all about--
    Their song is everywhere--
  Their notes are lovely (though they're out
    So often in the air).

  The zephyr, dancing through the tops
    Of ash and poplar, weaves
  Low melodies, and scarcely stops
    To murmur "By your leaves!"

  Night steeps the passions of the day
    In quiet, peace, and love.
  Pale Dian, in her tranquil way,
    Kicks up a shine above.

  _ON DRUNKEN COURAGE._

  Who only in his cups will fight is like
  A clock that must be oil'd well ere it strikes.

  Talking to ---- is like playing long whist.

        LADY ASHBURTON, _apud_ LORD HOUGHTON.


  _CERBERUS._

  My dog, who picks up everything one teaches,
  Has got "three heads," like Mr. Gladstone's speeches,
  But, as might naturally be expected,
  His are considerably more connected.

        H. J. BYRON, in _English Epigrams_.


  Blessed be the word "nice"!--it is the copper
  coin of commendation. Without it, we should

  _ON NEWGATE WINDOWS._

  All Newgate windows bay windows they be;
  All lookers out there stand at bay we see.

        JOHN HEYWOOD (1506-1565).


  It was a grand scene, Mr. Artemus Ward standing
  on the platform; many of the audience sleeping
  tranquilly in their seats; others leaving the
  room and not returning; others crying like a child at
  some of the jokes,--all, all formed a most impressive scene,
  and showed the powers of this remarkable orator. And
  when he announced that he should never lecture in that
  town again, the applause was absolutely deafening.

        C. F. BROWNE, _Artemus Ward's Lecture_.


  _THE REASONS FOR DRINKING._

  If all be true that I do think,
  There are five reasons we should drink:
  Good wine; a friend; or being dry;
  Or lest we should be by-and-by;
  Or any other reason why.

        HENRY ALDRICH.


  [Barham] having expressed himself in terms of
  abhorrence of a piece of baseness and treachery
  which came under his notice, he was addressed
  by the delinquent with--"Well, sir, perhaps some day
  you may come to change your opinion of me!" "Perhaps
  I may, sir," was the reply; "for if I should find
  any one who holds a more contemptible opinion of you
  than I do myself, I should lay down my own and take up
  his."

        R. H. D. BARHAM, _Life of Barham_.


  _FALSE LOVE'S QUIRK._

  "Oh, sweet one!" sighs the lover,
    "Could I but this discover,--
  Thy breast so softly moving,
    Will it ever cease from loving?"

  Says she, her eyes upturning,
    "The love within me burning
  No time can ever smother"--
    For some one or another!

        LORD SOUTHESK, _Greenwood's Farewell_.


  Benjamin Constant, on some one asking
  (with reference to his book on religion) how he
  managed to reconcile the statements of his
  latter volumes with those of his first, published so long
  ago, answered, "Il n'y a rien qui s'arrange aussi facilement
  que les faits."

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  I'm told that virgins augur some
  Misfortune if their shoe-strings come
              To grief on Friday:
  And so did Di, and then her pride
  Decreed that shoe-strings so untied
              Are "so untidy!"

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  On one occasion the late Lady Holland took
  [Luttrell] a drive in her carriage over a rough
  road; and as she was very nervous, she insisted
  on being driven at a foot's pace. This ordeal lasted
  some hours, and when he was at last released, poor
  Luttrell, perfectly exasperated, rushed into the nearest
  club-house, and exclaimed, clenching his teeth and
  hands, "The very funerals passed us!"

        GRONOW, _Recollections_.


  _TO A YOUNG LADY._

  An original something dear maid, you would win me
    To write, but how shall I begin?
  For I fear I have nothing original in me--
    Excepting Original Sin.

        THOMAS CAMPBELL.


  La société est un état de guerre, réglé par les lois.

        _L'Art de Parvenir._


  Perchance it was her eyes of blue,
    Her cheeks that might the rose have shamed,
  Her figure in proportion true
    To all the rules by artists framed;
  Perhaps it was her mental worth
    That made her lover love her so,
  Perhaps her name, or wealth, or birth,--
    I cannot tell--I do not know.

  He may have had a rival, who
    Did fiercely gage him to a duel,
  And being the luckiest of the two
    Defeated him with triumph cruel;
  Then _she_ may have proved false, and turned
    To welcome to her arms his foe,
  Left _him_ despairing, conquer'd, spurned,--
    I cannot tell--I do not know.

        _Songs of Singularity._


  It is of no use to tell a neighbour that his hens
  eat your tomatoes: it makes no impression on
  him, for the tomatoes are not his. The best
  way is to casually remark to him that he has a fine lot of
  chickens, pretty well grown, and that you like spring
  chickens broiled. He will take them away at once.

        C. D. WARNER, _My Summer in a Garden_.


  One persuaded his friend to marry a little woman,
  because of evils the least was to be chosen.

        _Conceits, Clinches_, etc. (1639).


  Charles Kemble used to tell a story about
  some poor foreigner, dancer or pantomimist in
  the country, who, after many annual attempts
  to clear his expenses, came forward one evening with a
  face beaming with pleasure and gratitude, and addressed
  the audience in these words:--"Dear Public! moche
  oblige. Ver good benefice--only lose half-a-crown. I
  come again!"

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Recollections_.


  "Let's show," said M'Clan, "to this Sassenach loon
  That the bag-pipes _can_ play him a regular tune.
  Let's see," said M'Clan, as he thoughtfully sat,
  "'In my Cottage' is easy--I'll practise at that."

  He blew at his "Cottage," and blew with a will,
  For a year, seven months, and a fortnight, until
  (You'll hardly believe it) M'Clan, I declare,
  Elicited something resembling an air.

  It was wild--it was fitful--as wild as the breeze--
  It wandered about into several keys;
  It was jerky, spasmodic, and harsh, I'm aware;
  But still it distinctly suggested an air.

        W. S. GILBERT, _Bab Ballads_.


  All men are brothers--Cains and Abels.

        ANON.


  The blameless king
  Rising again (to Lancelot's discontent,
  Who held all speeches a tremendous bore),
  Said, "If one duty to be done remains,
  And 'tis neglected, all the rest is nought
  But Dead Sea apples and the acts of Apes."

  Smiled Guinevere, and begged him not to preach;
  She knew that duty, and it should be done;
  So what of pudding on that festal night
  Was not consumed by Arthur and his guests,
  The queen upon the following morning fried.

        SHIRLEY BROOKS, _Wit and Humour_.


  One way of getting an idea of our fellow-countrymen's
  miseries is to go and look at their
  pleasures.

  _TO A RICH LADY._

  I will not ask if thou canst touch
    The tuneful ivory key,--
  Those silent notes of thine are such
    As quite suffice for me.

  I'll make no question if thy skill
    The pencil comprehends;--
  Enough for me, love, if thou still
    Canst draw--thy dividends.

        _Punch._


  At the Duke of Wellington's funeral, the little child
  of a friend of mine was standing with her mother
  at Lord Ashburton's window to see the mournful
  pageant. During the passage of the procession, she
  made no remark until the duke's horse was led by, its
  saddle empty, and his boots reversed in the stirrups,
  when she looked up in her mother's face and said,
  "Mamma, when we die, will there be nothing left of us
  but boots?"

        J. C. YOUNG, _Diary_.


  Such power hath Beer. The heart which Grief hath canker'd

  Dined with Mr. (Sydney) Smith. He told me of

  "My lord cannot stand Treeby more than two days,
  and Treeby cannot stand my lord for a longer

  "A sound basis of agreement," said Lord Roehampton.
  "I believe absence is a great element of charm."

        LORD BEACONSFIELD, _Endymion_.


  _SALAD._

  O cool in the summer is salad,
    And warm in the winter is love;
  And a poet shall sing you a ballad
    Delicious thereon and thereof.
  A singer I am, if no sinner,
    My muse has a marvellous wing,
  And I willingly worship at dinner
                The Sirens of Spring.

  Take Endive--like love it is bitter,
    Take beet--for like love it is red,
  Crisp leaf of the lettuce shall glitter,
    And cress from the rivulet's bed:
  Anchovies, foam-born, like the lady
    Whose beauty has maddened this bard;
  And olives, from groves that are shady;
                And eggs--boil 'em hard.

  The Mock Turtle said, "No wise fish would go
  anywhere without a porpoise."

  "Wouldn't it, really?" said Alice, in a tone of
  great surprise.

  "Of course not," said the Mock Turtle; "why, if a
  fish came to _me_, and told me he was going a journey, I
  should say, 'With what porpoise?'"

  "Don't you mean 'purpose?'" said Alice.

  "I mean what I say," the Mock Turtle replied, in an
  offended tone.

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Alice in Wonderland_.

  The Bishop of St. David's has been studying Welsh
  all the summer; it is a difficult language, and I
  hope he will be careful,--it is so easy for him to
  take up the Funeral Service and read it over the next
  wedding-party, or to make a mistake in a tense in a
  Confirmation, and the children will have renounced their
  godfathers and godmothers and got nothing in their
  place.

  Beautiful soup, so rich and green,
  Waiting in a hot tureen!
  Who for such dainties would not stoop?
  Soup of the evening, beautiful soup!
  Soup of the evening, beautiful soup!

  Beautiful soup! Who cares for fish,
  Game, or any other dish?
  Who would not give all else for two p
  Ennyworth only of beautiful soup?
  Pennyworth only of beautiful soup?

  Sir George Warrender was once obliged to put off

  O how unlike our shores,
  Where with ten thousand tongues each city roars!
  There to all men, whate'er their age or walk,
  Life's one great solemn business is to talk.
  There what the penny press by morning write
  Is echoed for a halfpenny at night:
  There stump young Ministers; old Maids debate;
  There loud Professors scold like Billingsgate:
  There, as the World into the Church expands,
  A moral Atheist spouts in parson's bands;
  And poets, doubtful of the parts of speech,
  Desperate of rhyme, acquire the art to preach.

  "You are the only Englishman I know who

  "It is rather sad," sighed Virginia, as she dived
  into a box of French chocolate-creams, "to
  think that all the poor people are drowned
  that these things belonged to."

  "They are not dead," said the Professor: "they still
  live on this holy and stupendous earth. They live in
  the use we are making of all they had got together. The
  owner of those chocolate-creams is immortal because you
  are eating them."

  Virginia licked her lips, and said, "Nonsense!"

  "It is not nonsense," said the Professor. "It is the
  religion of Humanity."

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Songs and Poems_.


  You are a woman; you must never speak what
  you think: your words must contradict your
  thoughts: but your actions may contradict your
  words. So, when I ask you if you can love me, you
  must say no; but you must love me too. If I tell you
  you are handsome, you must deny it, and say I flatter
  you; and you must think yourself more charming than
  I speak you, and like me for the beauty I say you have,
  as much as if I had it myself.

        _Tattle_, in CONGREVE's _Love for Love_.


  Dear Poet, do not rhyme at all!
    But if you must, don't tell your neighbour,

    Win vogue without extreme vexation;
  Yet hope for sympathy,--but don't
    Expect it from a near relation.

  There is a phrase we oft have seen
    On bottle-labels writ,
  And those who invalids have been
    Best know the drift of it;
  It may embody in a line
    A world of chemic lore,
  And skill to portion and combine--
    _The mixture as before_.

  This will apply to many things,
    To oratory most,
  Addresses made to kings and queens,
    And wedding speech and toast;
  For commonplace and compliment

  _This_ saves the trouble to invent--

  Now brim your glass, and plant it well
    Beneath your nose on the table,
  And you will find what philosophers tell
    Of I and non-I is no fable.
  Now listen to wisdom, my son!
      Myself am the subject,
      This wine is the object:
      These things are two,
      But I'll prove to you
  That subject and object are one.

  I take this glass in my hand, and stand
    Upon my legs, if I can,
  And look and smile benign and bland,
    And feel that I am a man.
  Now stretch all the strength of your brains!
      I drink--and the object
      Is lost in the subject,
      Making one entity
      In the identity
  Of me, and the wine in my veins!

  He stood on his head on the wild sea-shore,

  For he felt as he never had felt before,

    His mother-in-law had sail'd
  To a tropical country far away,
    Where tigers and snakes prevail'd.

  The sacred slow harmonium bring,

  The cymbals, with sonorous ring,
    The dulcet flageolet.

  Nor be the voice of glory dumb,
    Of conquest and of strife,
  Bring forth the stirring trump and drum,
    The shrill and piercing fife.

  Ay, bring them all, my soul with glee
    To music I'll devote;
  Bring all--for all are one to me,--
    I cannot play a note!

        _Songs of Singularity._


  We sometimes hate those who differ from us in

  When Mrs. M'Gibbon was preparing to act Jane
  Shore, at Liverpool, her dresser, an ignorant

  play. "Does she know me?" inquired the mistress.
  "Not at all," was the reply. "What a very odd request!"

  Once the mastodon was: pterodactyls were common as cocks:
  Then the Mammoth was God: now is He a prize ox.

  Parallels all things are: yet many of these are askew:
  You are certainly I: but certainly I am not you.

  Springs the rock from the plain, shoots the stream from the rock:
  Cocks exist for the hen: but hens exist for the cock.

  I've studied human nature, and I know a thing or two;
  Though a girl may fondly love a living gent, as many do:
  A feeling of disgust upon her senses there will fall
  When she looks upon his body chopped particularly small.

  The Bishop of Exeter, in the course of conversation
  at a dinner-party, mentioned that many
  years since, while trout-fishing, he lost his watch
  and chain, which he supposed had been pulled from his
  pocket by the bough of a tree. Some time afterwards,
  when staying in the same neighbourhood, he took a
  stroll by the side of the river, and came to the secluded
  spot where he supposed he had lost his valuables, and
  there, to his surprise and delight, he found them under a
  bush. The anecdote, vouched for by the word of a
  bishop, astonished the company; but this was changed
  to amusement by his son's inquiring whether the watch,
  when found, was going. "No," replied the bishop;
  "the wonder was that it was not gone."

  Know, then, that when that touching scene
   Had reached its tenderest pitch,
  When all was pathos, calm, serene,
    _His nose began to itch_.

  'Twas sad, but so it came to pass,
    The knight might chafe and frown,
  But could not reach it, for alas!
    _He wore his vizor down_.

        _Songs of Singularity._


  I remember asking [Bagehot] if he had enjoyed
  a particular dinner which he had rather expected
  to enjoy, but he replied, "No, the sherry was
  bad; tasted as if L---- had dropped his h's into it."

      R. H. HUTTON, _Memoir of W. Bagehot_.


  When Beings of the fairer sex
  Arrange their white arms round our necks,
    We are, we ought to be, enraptured.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _London Lyrics_.


  "Pray, Mr. Foote, do you ever go to church?"
  "No, madam; not that I see any harm in it."

        THOMAS MOORE, _Diary_.


  _ON AN INCAPABLE PERSON._

  Fortune advanced thee that all might aver
  That nothing is impossible to her.

        R. GARNETT (from the Greek).


  I remember a Trinity College (Dublin) story of
  a student who, having to translate Cæsar, rendered
  the first sentence, "Omnis Gallia divisa est
  in tres partes,"--"All Gaul is quartered into three
  halves."

        W. H. HARRISON, _University Magazine_.


  Always seem to be modest and bashful, yet wise;
  Remember the value of using your eyes;
  Recollect, too, that money's not easily met,
  And always accept every offer you get;
  Be polite to all--grandmammas, sisters, and mothers,
  For they've all of them grandsons, or own sons or brothers;
  And never forget the chief object in life
  Is to quickly be settled--a well-to-do wife.

        _Phoebe_, in H. P. STEPHENS's _Billee Taylor_.


  One asked what herb that was that cured all
  diseases. It was answered, "Time."

        _Conceits, Clinches_, etc. (1639).


  In his sleeves, which were long,
    He had twenty-four packs--
  Which was coming it strong,
    Yet I state but the facts;
  And we found on his nails, which were taper,
    What is frequent in tapers--that's wax.

        BRET HARTE, _Complete Works_.


  In a conversation which happened to turn on railway
  accidents and the variety of human sufferings,
  a bank director observed that he always
  felt great interest in the case of a broken limb. "Then,
  I suppose," said ----, "for a compound fracture you feel
  compound interest."

        W. JERDAN, _Memoirs_.


  _ON A CERTAIN POET._

  Thy verses are eternal, O my friend,
  For he who reads them reads them to no end.

        _A Collection of Epigrams_ (1727).


  One day, coming late to dinner in the country,
  [Lady Charlotte Lindsay] excused herself by
  the "macadamnable" state of the roads.

        LORD HOUGHTON, _Monographs_.


  I wish some girls that I could name
  Were half as silent as their pictures!

        W. M. PRAED.


  The other day I heard that whimsical fellow G----
  make a rather foolish remark, to the effect that
  the pleasure of _not_ going to church was a
  pleasure that _never_ palled.

        FREDERICK LOCKER, _Patchwork_.


  And day again declines;
  In shadow sleep the vines,
  And the last ray thro' the pines
          Feebly glows,
  Then sinks behind yon ridge;
  And the usual evening midge
  Is settling on the bridge
          Of my nose.

  And keen's the air and cold,
  And the sheep are in the fold,
  And Night walks stable-stoled
          Thro' the trees;
  And on the silent river
  The floating star-beams quiver;--
  And now, the saints deliver
          Us from fleas.

        C. S. CALVERLEY, _Verses and Translations_.


  Tommy Townshend, a violent, foolish fellow,
  who was always talking strong language, said in
  some debate, "Nothing will satisfy me but to
  have the noble Lord [North]'s head; I will have his
  head." Lord North said, "The honourable gentleman
  says he will have my head. I bear him no malice in
  return, for though the honourable gentleman says he will
  have my head, I can assure him I would on no account
  have his."

        CHARLES GREVILLE, _Diary_.


  With undissembled grief I tell,--
    For sorrow never comes too late,--
  The simplest bonnet in Pall Mall
    Is sold for £1 8_s._

        CATHARINE M. FANSHAWE.


  Said the Gryphon, "Do you know why it's called
  a whiting?"

  "I never thought about it," said Alice.
  "Why?"

  "_It does the boots and shoes_," the Gryphon replied
  very solemnly.

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled. "Does the boots and
  shoes?" she repeated in a wondering tone.

  "Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?" said the
  Gryphon. "I mean, what makes them so shiny?"

  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little
  before she gave her answer. "They're done with blacking,
  I believe."

  "Boots and shoes under the sea," the Gryphon went
  on in a deep voice, "are done with whiting. Now you
  know."

        LEWIS CARROLL, _Alice in Wonderland_.


  I'm always dull on Christmas Day,
    It lets a flood of ills in,
  For that's the time those birds of prey
    Bring all their horrid bills in!

        J. R. PLANCHÉ, _Songs and Poems_.


  The wit of a family is usually best received among
  strangers.

        GEORGE ELIOT, _Middlemarch_.


  Sweet maids in wimples fair y-wrought,
    Shall smile upon thee. Thou shalt say,
  Oft, by thy halidame, there's nought
    So gracious and so fair as they,
  But what thy halidame may be,
  I trow 'tis useless asking me.

        H. SAVILE CLARKE.


  Le vrai honnête homme est celui qui ne se pique de
  rien.

        LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, _Réflexions_.


  O memory! thou art but a sigh
    For friendships dead and loves forgot,
  And many a cold and altered eye
    That once did say--Forget me not!

  And I must bow me to thy laws,
    For--odd although it may be thought--
  I can't tell who the deuce it was
    That gave me this Forget-me-not!

        _Bon Gaultier Ballads._


  What is Truth? "Bring me the wash-hand basin,"
  is the reply of Pontius Pilate.

        HEINRICH HEINE, _The Denunciator_.


  _ON A RECENT ROBBERY._

  They came and stole my garments,
    My stockings, all my store,
  But they could not steal my sermons,
    For they were stolen before.

        REV. HENRY TOWNSHEND.


  Some folk's tongues are like the clocks as run on
  strikin', not to tell you the time o' day, but
  because there's summat wrong i' their own
  inside.

        _Mrs. Poyser_, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Adam Bede_.


  'Tis said that he lived upon bacon and beans,
  And that sometimes he dined upon salt pork and greens;
  But he thought that such feeding was rather humdrum,--
  "I've gone the whole hog," said little Tom Thumb.

  As Tom once was crossing a river close by,
  A salmon snapped up, as it would at a fly;
  But as it was dark Tom did sing rather mum--
  "I'm down in the mouth," said little Tom Thumb.

  Next day a black raven poor Tom did espy,
  Which carried him up to the heaven so high;
  If the bird let him go, to the ground would he come--
  "I'll be dashed if I do," said little Tom Thumb.

        J. A. SIDEY, _Mistura Curiosa_.


  It is often harder to praise a friend than an enemy.

        W. HAZLITT, _Characteristics_.


  _ON A CERTAIN PARSON._

  By purchase a man's property is known:
  Scarf's sermons and his livings are his own.

        _Epigrams in Distich_ (1740).


  I measure men's dullness by the devices they
  trust in for deceiving others. Your dullest
  animal is he who grins and says he doesn't mind
  just after he has had his shins kicked.

        MACHIAVELLI, in GEORGE ELIOT's _Romola_.


  _GRAMMATICAL._

  The least drop in the world I do not mind:
  "Cognac" 's a noun I never yet declined.

        H. J. BYRON, in _English Epigrams_.


  "There is no middle course," said Charles X. to
  Talleyrand, "between the throne and the
  scaffold!" "Your Majesty forgets the post-chaise!"

        CRABB ROBINSON, _Diary_.


  I could not, while you shone,
    Run all that heartless _babble off_
  That marks the modern _Babylon_.

        ROBERT REECE, in _Comic Poets_.


  _TO AN IMPORTUNATE HOST
  DURING DINNER AND AFTER TENNYSON._

  Ask me no more: I've had enough Chablis;
      The wine may come again, and take the shape,
      From glass to glass, of "Mountain" or of "Cape;"
  But, my dear boy, when I have answered thee,
                                      Ask me no more.

  Ask me no more: what answer should I give?
      I love not pickled pork nor partridge pie;
      I feel if I took whisky I should die;
  Ask me no more--for I prefer to live:
                                      Ask me no more.

  Ask me no more: unless my fate is sealed,
      And I have striven against you all in vain:
      Let your good butler bring me Hock again:
  Then rest, dear boy. If for this once I yield,
                                      Ask me no more.

        W. D. A.


  Sir Robert Grant told a story well, and
  could pun successfully without boring. By way
  of instance, on the beach at Sidmouth he pronounced
  the six beautiful Miss Twopennys to be the
  "Splendid shilling."

        LORD TEIGNMOUTH, _Reminiscences_.


  Oh to be wafted away
    From this black Aceldama of sorrow,
  Where the dust of an earthy to-day,
    Is the earth of a dusty to-morrow!

       _Bunthorne_, in W. S. GILBERT's _Patience_.


  One said, painters were cunning fellows, for they
  had a colour for everything they did.

        _Conceits, Clinches_, etc. (1639).


  Dey vent to hear a breecher of
    De last sensadion shtyle,
  'Twas 'nough to make der tyfel weep
    To see his "awful shmile."
  "Vot bities dat der Fechter ne'er
    Vos in Theologie.
  Dey'd make him pishop in dis shoorsh,"
    Said Breitmann, said he.

        C. G. LELAND, _Breitmann Ballads_.


  "Oh! Pat; and what do you think will be your
  feelings on the day of judgment when you
  meet Mrs. Mahoney, and the pig you stole from
  her, face to face?" "Does your reverence think the pig
  will be there?" "Ay, indeed, will he; and what will ye
  say then?" "I shall say, your reverence, 'Mrs. Mahoney,
  dear, here's the pig that I borrowed of ye, and I'm
  mighty glad to have this opportunity of restoring him!'"

        _Life of Rev. W. Harness._


  _In vino veritas!_--which means
    A man's a very ass in liquor;
  The "thief that slowly steals our brains"
    Makes nothing but the temper quicker.
  Next morning brings a train of woes,
    But finds the passions much sedater--
  Who was it, now, that pulled my nose?--
    I'd better go and ask the waiter.

        H. CHOLMONDELEY PENNELL, _Pegasus Resaddled_.


  Jones, the tailor, was asked by a customer, who
  thought much of his cut, to go down and have
  some shooting with him in the country. Among
  the party was the Duke of Northumberland. "Well,
  Mr. Jones," observed his Grace, "I'm glad to see that
  you are becoming a sportsman. What sort of gun do
  you shoot with?" "Oh, with a double-breasted one,
  your Grace," was the reply.

        _Life of Rev. W. Harness._


  Now wedlock is a sober thing,
    No more of chains or forges!
  A plain young man, a plain gold ring,
    The curate, and St. George's.

        EDWARD FITZGERALD.


  The greatest advantage I know of being thought
  a wit by the world, is, that it gives one the
  greater freedom of playing the fool.

       POPE, _Thoughts on Various Subjects_.


  Conceive me, if you can,
  An every-day young man:
      A common-place type,
      With a stick and a pipe,
  And a half-bred black-and-tan;
      Who thinks suburban "hops"
      More fun than "Monday Pops";
  Who's fond of his dinner,
  And doesn't get thinner,
      On bottled beer and chops;--
      A common-place young man--
      A matter-of-fact young man--
  A steady and stolid-y, jolly Bank-holiday
      Every-day young man!

        _Grosvenor_, in W. S. GILBERT's _Patience_.


  I do not so much want to avoid being cheated, as
  to afford the expense of being so; the generality
  of mankind being seldom in good humour but
  whilst they are imposing upon you in some shape or
  other.

        SHENSTONE, _Essays_.


  Only think, to have lords overrunning the nation,
  As plenty as frogs in a Dutch inundation;
  No shelter from barons, from earls no protection,
  And tadpole young lords, too, in every direction,--
  Things created in haste, just to make a court list of,
  Two legs and a coronet all they consist of!

        THOMAS MOORE.


  Lo! the king, his footsteps this way bending,
  His cogitative faculties immersed
  In cogibundity of cogitation.

        _Aldiborontiphoscophornio_, in CAREY's _Chrononhotonthologos_.


  It is with narrow-souled people, as with narrow-necked
  bottles: the less they have in them, the
  more noise they make in pouring out.

        POPE, _Thoughts on Various Subjects_.


  One privilege to man is left--
    The privilege of earning
  The doss that pays the weekly bills.

        H. CHOLMONDELEY PENNELL, _Pegasus Resaddled_.


  _Happy thought._--"Fridoline!" I have her
  permission to call her Fridoline.

  Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!! Happy
  thoughts!!!

  I think I am speaking: she speaks: we speak
  together. A pause. Oh, for one happy thought, now.

  "May I?" Her head is turned away from me:
  slightly. She does not move. "I may?"

  _Happy Thought._--I do.

        F. C. BURNAND, _Happy Thoughts_.
